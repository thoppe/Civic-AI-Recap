WEBVTT

00:04.851 --> 00:18.114
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

00:21.755 --> 00:22.155
Thank you.

00:22.235 --> 00:26.796
So our first item of business is to swear in our new member.

00:27.136 --> 00:30.877
And so if Jayden Gray will come forward, I will swear you in right here.

00:35.162 --> 00:37.023
So please raise your right hand.

00:37.083 --> 00:37.183
Okay.

00:37.203 --> 00:37.323
I, J.J.

00:37.343 --> 00:46.309
Dengrae, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

01:03.285 --> 01:05.506
That I will bear true faith and allegiance.

01:05.786 --> 01:07.687
That I will bear true faith and allegiance.

01:08.267 --> 01:10.428
To the Constitution of the United States.

01:10.568 --> 01:12.409
To the Constitution of the United States.

01:13.430 --> 01:15.811
And the Constitution of the State of California.

01:16.131 --> 01:18.352
And the Constitution of the State of California.

01:18.932 --> 01:20.873
That I take this obligation freely.

01:21.174 --> 01:22.894
That I take this obligation freely.

01:23.315 --> 01:25.195
Without any mental reservation.

01:25.396 --> 01:26.916
Without any mental reservation.

01:27.336 --> 01:28.537
Or purpose of evasion.

01:28.737 --> 01:29.878
Or purpose of evasion.

01:30.338 --> 01:32.719
And that I will well and faithfully discharge

01:33.649 --> 01:39.171
and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter.

01:39.571 --> 01:41.572
The duties upon which I'm about to enter.

01:41.872 --> 01:43.313
Thank you, congratulations.

01:43.593 --> 01:54.877
Alright, so we will...

01:56.488 --> 01:59.355
Now begin with the report of the superintendent.

01:59.515 --> 02:06.511
Tom Torlakson is at an international conference of importance in Ireland and so the chief deputy will produce it.

02:07.217 --> 02:08.078
Thank you, President Chris.

02:08.138 --> 02:15.245
Yes, Superintendent Torleyson is in Ireland at an international meeting on accountability, continuous improvement and well-being.

02:15.766 --> 02:19.530
So I'll be sitting in for the superintendent today, be with you.

02:19.650 --> 02:26.637
And tomorrow, you'll get the A-team with Deputy Superintendent Carrick Ashley, who will be joining you for the meeting.

02:27.381 --> 02:45.457
So Superintendent Torleson had an extremely busy summer and really wants to congratulate and extend appreciation to all the parents, students, and educators around the state for everything that happened over the summer and the fantastic opening of school that we've had throughout the state of California.

02:46.101 --> 02:48.902
A couple items that I wanted to highlight for the superintendent.

02:49.522 --> 03:01.006
One, I'm hoping that board members and members of the public saw that Superintendent Torreson appointed Dr. Thelma Melendez de Santa Anna as the new State Administrator for Englewood Unified.

03:01.386 --> 03:07.689
We're so delighted that Dr. Melendez applied for the position and has taken on that role and she started on August 15th.

03:08.769 --> 03:18.808
She's got a challenging assignment ahead of her and we're asking everyone to lend her a hand as she moves forward and we're expecting really, really great things from Dr. Melendez in Inglewood.

03:19.545 --> 03:26.208
You know, traditionally summertime has been a time when we just kind of took a break in education, but that isn't really the case anymore.

03:26.448 --> 03:36.292
And Superintendent Torrelson wants to really thank all of California's expanded learning programs for the great summer programs that were offered throughout the summer.

03:36.712 --> 03:43.155
He had the opportunity to visit expanded learning programs in Roble Elementary here in Sac City and also at

03:44.115 --> 03:49.838
Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools in Los Angeles Unified in August.

03:50.098 --> 04:09.827
And the superintendent feels that expanded learning programs are incredibly important and has also recently taken a position that we're hoping others will join against the president's proposed budget cuts for particularly Title IV-B and in other areas that relate to preparing our students to succeed and thrive.

04:10.668 --> 04:11.048
And in

04:11.892 --> 04:20.675
In July, the superintendent had the chance to host State Superintendent Chris Reichtel from the state of Washington here in California.

04:21.056 --> 04:38.282
And we're looking at some joint action between Washington, Oregon, and California and of the West Coast block, if you will, in relationship to taking a strong stance in support of some of our critical federal programs and their funding.

04:38.342 --> 04:39.743
So look for that coming out soon.

04:41.087 --> 04:47.990
The superintendent also took an active stand around some of the events, the unfortunate events of the summer.

04:48.790 --> 04:52.611
The first being the unfortunate events that occurred in Charlottesville.

04:52.651 --> 05:03.375
And I just want to read a quote from him where he said, we must remind California school community in our nation that our great state respects, celebrates, and embraces our incredibly diverse population.

05:03.775 --> 05:05.636
We denounce religious intolerance,

05:06.116 --> 05:09.938
racism, and any and all forms of discrimination.

05:09.978 --> 05:15.061
We know in California that diversity is our strength and we have to take a great stand against it.

05:15.121 --> 05:24.866
And he particularly encouraged educators to review a really great blog post from the Learning Policy Institute called Moving Forward from Charlottesville.

05:25.766 --> 05:34.593
The superintendent has also taken a very strong stand, uniting with other state leaders against the federal decision to rescind DACA.

05:35.113 --> 05:42.039
And he noted, I wanted to let all those students know that the American dream remains safe and secure in California.

05:42.539 --> 05:47.303
Our great state will continue supporting these terrific students and their families.

05:47.663 --> 05:52.707
And the superintendent has called on Congress to swiftly restore the DACA program.

05:53.719 --> 06:04.087
As many of you know, and we'll be hearing about later today, our Department of Education is engaging in a very active program of realignment to support LCFF priorities.

06:05.228 --> 06:10.192
One of those activities is some of the internal work that we're doing, which we call CDE Team Advancement.

06:10.752 --> 06:20.360
and just wanted to note a really great event coming up on September 22nd, and there's some flyers around the room, which we're calling our CDE Back-to-School Festival.

06:20.660 --> 06:25.284
We're going to have a whole series of incredible professional learning events here in the building.

06:25.925 --> 06:28.527
We hashtag it for CDE by CDE.

06:29.027 --> 06:38.335
So if you ever want to know why you should have your next romance with cowpats, the Back-to-School Festival is your chance to learn.

06:38.915 --> 06:46.440
But another really key event will be building on the superintendent's initiative around safe havens.

06:47.161 --> 06:53.105
And the superintendent has asked districts around the state of California to declare themselves as safe havens.

06:53.565 --> 06:58.688
And so far, over 100 school districts have done that, representing more than 2.7 million students.

07:00.450 --> 07:17.134
But we now find ourselves in a place where as important and critical as that work is, that we need to move what we're calling beyond safe havens to really work on the kinds of safe and supportive school environments that will make all families and students feel safe and appreciated.

07:17.154 --> 07:19.835
So as part of the Back to School Festival,

07:21.336 --> 07:28.201
On September 22nd, we're hosting a special conference that will be a strand within the Back to School Festival called Beyond Safe Havens.

07:28.301 --> 07:36.487
And the superintendent is delighted to announce that Attorney General Javier Becerra, Sacramento Mayor Dale Steinberg will be in attendance on that day.

07:36.848 --> 07:39.570
We're going to have a fantastic panel right here in this room.

07:40.611 --> 07:43.573
Dr. Ortiz-Lacon will be joining us as part of that panel.

07:45.274 --> 07:50.857
The event itself is basically sold out at this point, but it will be streamed online.

07:51.297 --> 07:55.859
And the link for that, it's actually the same link that's used for streaming these board meetings.

07:55.919 --> 08:03.563
In fact, if you ever want to link into an event that's being held in this room that's being streamed, it's always the same link and it's up on the posters.

08:04.603 --> 08:12.026
So, last but not least, just wanted to end up on some incredibly good news as we start today's meeting.

08:12.446 --> 08:23.069
I hope that everyone had a chance to take a look at this recent research report from Research Triangle International, which showed college eligibility in the state of California at an all-time high.

08:23.809 --> 08:27.391
Not just growing, not just getting stronger, but at an all-time high.

08:29.758 --> 08:34.341
that related both to CSU and to UC.

08:34.801 --> 08:42.005
So, for example, in 2007, the state of California had 46,000 students who were eligible for UC.

08:42.025 --> 08:44.706
By 2015, that number had grown to 60,000, so a growth of over 30%.

08:49.569 --> 08:51.531
Similar numbers were present for CSU.

08:51.551 --> 08:51.531
2007, 114,000.

08:51.611 --> 08:52.432
175,000 in 2015, so a 53% growth rate.

08:52.472 --> 08:53.473
But the good news doesn't stop there.

08:53.493 --> 08:57.716
We're all committed to closing our achievement gaps and the data showed some really dramatic shrinkage

09:08.465 --> 09:11.067
in the gaps around college eligibility.

09:11.107 --> 09:18.111
So going back to that 2007-2015 comparison, in 2007 the eligibility gap for CSU between white and Latino students was 14.6 percent.

09:18.131 --> 09:18.452
14.6 percent.

09:18.512 --> 09:19.953
By 2015 that had dropped to 7.9.

09:28.218 --> 09:34.721
So some real evidence of going down, not anywhere near where we want it to be, but some evidence of getting smaller.

09:35.121 --> 09:41.484
Similarly, for white and African American students, eligibility for CSU in 2007 was 13.1, declining to 9.8 in 2015.

09:47.626 --> 09:56.272
Some evidence that all this work that we're doing, the shifting of resources that we've done through the magnificent local control funding formula is starting to have an impact in our state.

09:56.292 --> 10:01.956
And the superintendent wanted to put that data out to everyone as we as we start the meeting today.

10:02.557 --> 10:12.324
So on behalf of the superintendent, just wanted to thank everyone throughout California for all the great work that's happening as we move the state forward and looking forward to a great meeting today.

10:12.584 --> 10:12.824
Thank you.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.161
Thank you.

10:15.301 --> 10:19.286
So I'll begin with the announcements today.

10:19.426 --> 10:24.032
And our first thing is to, of course, welcome again our new member, Jayden Gray.

10:24.573 --> 10:31.662
He is a senior at James Logan High School, which is New Haven Unified School District in the East Bay on the Southern part.

10:33.144 --> 10:38.508
He is the board representative and class president of the student body.

10:39.508 --> 10:43.672
He is the team captain of the speech and debate team since 2014.

10:43.732 --> 10:52.519
The founder of the Young Democrats Club and student head on the school site council for his high school.

10:53.459 --> 10:57.923
Beyond academics, he is a member of his school's varsity track and field team.

10:58.915 --> 11:09.721
And as a member of Community Action, he is on the Union City Youth Commission and President and Youth Representative on the Union City General Plan Committee.

11:10.481 --> 11:16.084
And since 2016, he has also been an interim clerk in the offices of John L. Burrus.

11:17.004 --> 11:20.246
I don't know when he sleeps, but please join me in welcoming Jayden.

11:26.894 --> 11:34.236
So, I'm also delighted to announce the return to our staff of the State Board of Donna Neville.

11:34.516 --> 11:39.717
And she is entering the State Board Education Office again where she is retired and new.

11:40.357 --> 11:46.478
She previously served in the State Board of Education staff from 2008 to 2009 as Chief Counsel.

11:47.158 --> 11:54.840
And she then left to work at the Office of the State Auditor as Associate Chief Counsel and then as Chief Counsel when she retired.

11:55.860 --> 12:05.347
Prior to joining State Board in 2008, she had worked in the Office of the Legislative Council as Deputy Legal Counsel for the Legislature.

12:05.928 --> 12:10.191
And she will be working primarily on legal issues but other public policy issues.

12:10.211 --> 12:15.155
Donna, why don't you stand up so we can see who you are and please join me in welcoming.

12:18.519 --> 12:30.244
I'd also like to acknowledge the contributions of Amber Alexander who has done a fantastic job in managing our local control funding formula projects for the State Board of Education staff this year.

12:31.825 --> 12:39.868
Amber decided to return to the Department of Finance where she will work on career and technical education and special education fiscal issues.

12:40.889 --> 12:43.950
Please join me in thanking Amber for all of her hard work.

12:48.669 --> 12:53.810
And if you come up, I have a certificate of appreciation for your service.

13:05.993 --> 13:12.555
So we always see members of the Department of Finance, so this will not be a goodbye at all in that sense.

13:14.886 --> 13:29.348
I'd like to announce that the State Board of Education recently sent out recruitment notices to fill vacancies on several of our commissions, including the California Practitioners Advisory Group, the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools,

13:30.151 --> 13:34.773
the Instructional Quality Commission, and next year's student board member.

13:35.294 --> 13:39.616
So, please visit the State Board of Education webpage to look at those things.

13:40.716 --> 13:45.599
One change in the agenda, item 23 has been removed from the agenda.

13:46.479 --> 13:52.502
That was scheduled at the end of today, Wednesday, removed by the Chief Deputy of California Department of Education.

13:52.562 --> 13:54.723
So, we will not be taking up item 23.

13:56.858 --> 14:00.328
Spanish interpreter services will be available on Wednesday.

14:00.569 --> 14:02.815
We have three public hearings, items 19, 20, 21.

14:05.718 --> 14:10.420
We have regular consent items that we'll take up later in the day.

14:12.020 --> 14:14.761
Proposed waiver consent items also.

14:14.781 --> 14:23.284
I want to announce to board members that the letters from the public are in your electronic red folder, which I'm sure all of you have seen.

14:24.204 --> 14:29.126
The State Board of Education meeting can be assessed fully by electronic agenda.

14:29.166 --> 14:30.767
We have one copy in the lobby.

14:31.747 --> 14:35.728
All speakers, please sign in at the table just outside this room.

14:36.788 --> 14:40.409
Binders are on the table with separate pages for each item number.

14:41.250 --> 14:49.852
Sign on the page that identifies the item number on which you would like to speak and help ensure that we can keep track of all speakers.

14:51.372 --> 14:57.374
Item 22 is a general public comment item for items not specifically listed on the board's agenda.

14:58.285 --> 15:08.291
If you wish to give the board anything, please provide 25 copies to Amy Bubico, who's sitting right down there in the front on my left-hand side.

15:09.652 --> 15:14.716
And please, speakers, introduce yourself as to who you are.

15:15.416 --> 15:21.660
And there is additional seating with TV monitors outside of this room in 11,000, room 11,003.

15:21.760 --> 15:22.821
So, with that, we're

15:29.098 --> 15:40.545
going to run the meeting with one minute limits on speakers, except on item four, where five people who come together will get three minutes.

15:41.706 --> 15:46.790
So with those items of information out of the way, we're ready for item one.

15:48.130 --> 16:00.674
and this is a CD performance and progress update on our Smarter Balanced Assessment and the online reporting system for the Smarter Balanced Assessment.

16:02.054 --> 16:05.375
Michelle Center will present for the California Department of Education.

16:06.396 --> 16:16.499
Good morning, President Kirst, board members, Deputy Superintendent Price, I'm Michelle Center, Director of the Assessment Development and Administration Division here at the department.

16:17.489 --> 16:29.803
The item before you, item one, requires no action on your part today, and I will be sharing a few highlights from that item, though the item before you does have additional detail on topics that are just not part of the presentation.

16:31.065 --> 16:37.772
As you know, through our online reporting system, districts have had access to their own scores for many months.

16:39.251 --> 16:43.633
At this time each year, we also post score results to our public website.

16:44.474 --> 16:47.535
We plan to do that public reporting in September.

16:48.496 --> 17:01.482
While the public results have not been posted to that site yet, please note that we are confident in the accuracy of the student results that have been given to districts, schools, parents, and students.

17:02.506 --> 17:10.933
We take the accuracy of our public reporting site very seriously and have a process by which we invite our LEAs to preview their data.

17:11.934 --> 17:17.319
Once that preview period is complete, we will schedule the public release for later this month.

17:20.061 --> 17:27.848
The CDE will be providing you, our board members, with results of the statewide assessment via an October information memorandum.

17:29.093 --> 17:46.898
While the public release of our summatives is one piece of information, it's also important to note that we also provide information to our educators in California through our interim assessment reporting system, which is a different reporting system than what they use for our summative assessments.

17:48.012 --> 17:58.136
As a reminder, more than 7 million interim assessments were given in the 16-17 school year in California across more than 1,500 LEAs.

17:59.436 --> 18:10.120
This is far greater than the number of summative assessments and goes to illustrate the impact that the interim reporting system can have for our districts, schools, educators, and students.

18:11.735 --> 18:21.197
The CDE has worked collaboratively with Smarter Balanced and several California districts to make enhancements to that system, which was launched on September 5th.

18:22.058 --> 18:29.660
My staff, led by Jessica Valdez, and several California districts deserve kudos for their work on this important project.

18:30.160 --> 18:37.442
And I think when you see it demonstrated today, you will also feel excited about the enhancements that we have made to that site.

18:38.922 --> 18:41.943
I will be inviting a couple guest speakers to join me today.

18:43.503 --> 18:47.565
First, I'm going to welcome to the podium Mr. Moses George.

18:48.105 --> 18:52.466
He is the student testing and assessment specialist from Los Angeles Unified School District.

18:53.126 --> 19:05.490
He is here today to share his district's experience participating in the development of that interim assessment reporting system and how he sees this new reporting system helping teachers guide instruction.

19:06.450 --> 19:06.930
Mr. George.

19:11.874 --> 19:12.634
Good morning, everybody.

19:13.614 --> 19:17.695
President Christ, members of the board and Chief Deputy Superintendent Price.

19:18.295 --> 19:19.496
Thank you very much for this honor.

19:19.516 --> 19:20.636
My name is Moses George.

19:20.956 --> 19:24.437
And as Michelle said, I represent the Los Angeles Unified School District.

19:25.017 --> 19:26.437
It's great teachers and students.

19:27.037 --> 19:34.679
And it's an honor to be able to speak and share a few minutes of our experience with the interim assessments and the interim assessment reporting system and the enhancements.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.299
Over the past three years,

19:37.239 --> 19:54.611
Our teachers and staff in Los Angeles Unified School District have found great value in using the interim assessments as a tool that has informed teachers practice and as a tool that students have had the opportunity to use to experience the Smarter Balanced assessments throughout the entire year.

19:57.553 --> 20:03.577
We have gone as far as every year ensuring that all of our schools have a trained CAS testing coordinator,

20:04.204 --> 20:16.054
that has been able to guide all of our schools through the use of the interim assessments and through the use of the scoring system that then produces the data that the interim assessment reporting system gives to our teachers.

20:17.094 --> 20:30.165
Throughout the past three years, even with the limitations of the data that was generated with the initial or previous interim assessment reporting system, our teachers and schools found great value in using the interim assessments.

20:31.326 --> 20:32.286
The value was such

20:33.231 --> 20:55.625
that at many of our schools, we found teachers and teams of teachers that were actually manually going deeper into the results that they received and the work that the students were doing in the interim assessments to disaggregate the data themselves and to find deeper value on their own through their own time because of the value that they saw in the interim assessments.

20:57.146 --> 21:02.770
Upon hearing about the enhancements that Michelle and her team were wanting to create,

21:03.809 --> 21:14.332
and having been contacted to take part, we were certain that our staffs, our teachers, and our stakeholders would want to be part of giving input into the enhancements.

21:14.952 --> 21:29.757
And sure enough, as soon as we put out the word, we had an abundance of individuals from all stakeholder groups that were eager to share of their experiences and of the enhancements that they thought that would be beneficial to the Interim Assessment Reporting System.

21:30.680 --> 21:48.224
We reached out and received information and feedback from our stakeholders from elementary, middle, and high school, from our local districts, from instructional leaders at the district offices, and from all, we gained great, great information that we were then able to share with Michelle and her team.

21:49.873 --> 22:05.092
Going forward, we have absolutely no doubts that what we have already seen with the new enhancements, that our staffs, our teachers are going to be ecstatic when they start to be trained and be able to use these new enhancements from the reporting system.

22:06.153 --> 22:08.095
From what before, they used to get a

22:10.353 --> 22:22.720
below standard, at standard, or above standard as the data that they would be able to have to now being able to see at a claim level or at a standard at a target level

22:23.743 --> 22:33.953
and the answers that the kids gave to the actual question and to then be able to see the written response that the student gave and be able to work with it and with the students.

22:34.553 --> 22:46.324
These are the kind of enhancements to the reporting system that we are certain that our teachers are going to use to even greater benefits in the work that they are doing with their students on a daily basis.

22:47.465 --> 22:48.667
We want to thank you greatly.

22:49.483 --> 22:55.848
for this opportunity to be part of the development of this enhanced reporting system.

22:56.388 --> 23:15.482
And we want to eagerly say that we want to continue the collaboration in further developing this tool that we are certain is going to become the state-of-the-art formative assessment tool that our teachers have so wanted and needed to have in order to be able to do the quality of job that they want to do for their students.

23:16.002 --> 23:17.643
We thank you and for this opportunity.

23:17.824 --> 23:18.044
Thank you.

23:25.029 --> 23:32.874
So I'd like to thank Mr. George as well as all of those that participated at LA Unified as well as other California districts.

23:33.414 --> 23:36.035
This has really been a project, a long-term project.

23:36.095 --> 23:45.601
It started back in 2015 and we knew when we rolled out the interim reporting system what the number one request was from Teachers in California.

23:46.181 --> 23:49.264
And that was for them to see the actual responses of their students.

23:49.785 --> 23:54.389
So we went into this project knowing that that was the number one request, but we didn't stop there.

23:54.589 --> 23:57.071
And there are additional enhancements beyond that in the system.

23:57.992 --> 24:01.135
So next, I'd like to welcome Tony Alpert.

24:01.275 --> 24:04.238
He's the executive director of the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium.

24:04.659 --> 24:11.185
He's going to share with you the enhancements and some screenshots of the system through a demonstration.

24:18.035 --> 24:22.778
President Kirst, members of the board, and Deputy Price, thank you for the opportunity to talk with you.

24:22.798 --> 24:33.486
I am Tony Elpert, now a very proud UC slug, now that the consortium has moved to the University of Santa Cruz College of Extension.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.249
A banana slug, sorry, a very specific type of slug.

24:41.419 --> 25:01.429
So I think Mr. George really gave the important information about the enhancements, and that is that the process by which they were developed was through collaboration with local educators, significantly from California, but also from across the consortium.

25:02.810 --> 25:11.014
and with significant input from Michelle and her staff that is absolutely vital to our success.

25:11.275 --> 25:22.241
And in addition, the board was involved in approving funding that then helped ETS provide data, which then is inserted into the system.

25:22.341 --> 25:25.223
So the collaboration goes well beyond

25:26.084 --> 25:29.971
any single individual, well beyond a school, well beyond a single state.

25:30.352 --> 25:36.743
There are many people that need to be a part of this in order to make it successful, so I want to express my gratitude for everyone involved.

25:38.399 --> 25:45.803
So as Michelle described, we actually started this process way back in December 2015 as a public agency.

25:45.883 --> 25:49.565
As you know, things take a little bit of time to get moving.

25:50.445 --> 25:54.167
And it's not just because of the logistical processes of procurement.

25:54.828 --> 26:00.771
When we were deciding to release an RFP, we engage all of our members and ask, what do they need?

26:02.031 --> 26:03.332
and they ask their stakeholders.

26:03.392 --> 26:08.875
So that communication is happening continuously on a lot of different projects.

26:08.955 --> 26:20.082
And in this case, it really resulted in a contract that began work in fall of 2016 in collaboration with another partner, Fairway Technologies.

26:21.423 --> 26:36.640
So the department staff and staff from LEAs and schools work closely with Smarter Balanced to address questions like which data and information should be available, how should the information be arranged in the screen so it's easy to use,

26:37.480 --> 26:39.421
How would an educator move through the system?

26:39.541 --> 26:45.763
So where would she start and where would she move after she had answered one question?

26:46.164 --> 26:54.287
And really get that impact or that focus from teachers about giving the information that they need in the manner that they need it when they need it.

26:55.127 --> 27:04.396
And then, of course, user acceptance testing, asking those educators to confirm that what they said should be in the system is actually in the system, which is an important part.

27:04.436 --> 27:13.165
And then we'll follow up with teachers after that to find out if what we thought we were doing actually helped them do what they need to do.

27:14.733 --> 27:22.777
So I think Mr. George described many of the enhancements, so I'll run through them briefly.

27:23.417 --> 27:33.081
One of the most important is that teachers can actually see the item that was presented to the students and see the students' response, each student's response embedded in that item.

27:36.503 --> 27:36.783
Thank you.

27:37.824 --> 27:42.986
So the, and the, sorry.

27:44.532 --> 27:46.474
Can you see it up there, folks?

27:47.035 --> 27:47.175
Yeah.

27:47.596 --> 27:48.397
Yeah, it's fine.

27:48.877 --> 27:49.138
What?

27:49.258 --> 27:49.518
Okay.

27:51.200 --> 27:51.561
Thank you.

27:58.197 --> 28:07.148
So, and that's the true promise of the interim assessments, which we describe as non-public and non-secure.

28:07.588 --> 28:14.877
That is, we don't want the items to be posted publicly on websites so that teachers have the option of administering them as novel tasks.

28:15.217 --> 28:25.062
But we want teachers to have the flexibility to administer them as standardized tests or to administer them interactively with their students, projecting them up on the board.

28:25.463 --> 28:36.809
And we want teachers to be able to look at the items themselves and how students responded to that with the additional context necessary to help them make more comprehensive evaluations of what students know and can do.

28:37.529 --> 28:44.656
As a prerequisite to that, teachers need to have access to their specific students and the tests that their students took.

28:44.736 --> 29:00.070
So a big portion of the enhancement is something we call student groups, where someone authorized by the district, probably delegated to the school, that has access to all the personally identifiable information for students, very restricted access.

29:00.890 --> 29:22.855
those folks then delegate access to individual kids with specific labels, which might be classroom names, it might be periods, it might be programs like AVID, whatever clustering label they want to organize students into groups that then they can analyze the performance of those students.

29:24.873 --> 29:41.500
Then we wanted to be able to give an overview of the item, the results, across the test and within the test, so allowing teachers to dig in quickly to see which items students performed well on and which ones they might have struggled with.

29:42.400 --> 30:00.594
And then the most important, probably the one that we're most proud of, is the work to connect the information in the interim assessment, the performance of students on interim assessment tests, to resources in the digital library that help guide teachers on what their next steps might be.

30:02.398 --> 30:04.961
So the work is not nearly complete.

30:05.442 --> 30:08.505
We have a whole bunch of enhancements scheduled for release in March.

30:08.885 --> 30:13.711
That includes a distractor analysis for what's called non-constructive response.

30:14.311 --> 30:17.855
So as you know, we have a variety of item types in Smarter Balanced.

30:17.915 --> 30:22.701
Some of them are very complex in terms of what the plausible answers a student might be.

30:23.141 --> 30:32.966
So those aren't necessarily as easy to display in terms of a distractor analysis and to comprehensively described the wrong answers that students chose.

30:33.346 --> 30:42.271
But for those multiple choice items where a distractor analysis is appropriate, we'll have some additional functionality release incorporated into the system to support that analysis.

30:42.891 --> 30:51.860
We're going to be looking at longitudinal data displays, which is very complex in the interim assessment because of the flexibility that I mentioned previously.

30:52.260 --> 30:59.547
So teachers are able to code whether or not the assessments were administered in a standardized or more flexible fashion.

31:00.488 --> 31:05.673
They have the flexibility to administer the interim assessments throughout the year.

31:06.113 --> 31:12.898
You can imagine that within a school year, interpreting growth or change over time with all that flexibility is difficult.

31:13.278 --> 31:25.246
And then you can imagine data over multiple years where those tests might not have been administered by the particular teacher, passing on all the context necessary to make good decisions about those results.

31:25.906 --> 31:28.088
over time is even more complex.

31:28.168 --> 31:36.715
So we're going to tread cautiously and we're not going to release it until we're confident that your teachers can give us good advice about how to make that data workable.

31:37.175 --> 31:45.442
And then an additional element to that is allowing the current school to see a test that were administered in a different school.

31:45.502 --> 31:52.268
And that's a pretty complex data transfer and needs to be attended to very carefully as well.

31:52.868 --> 31:57.873
And then we'll talk a little bit about the more robust links to the digital library.

31:58.454 --> 32:01.457
So I'll go through some of these screenshots pretty quickly.

32:01.497 --> 32:10.587
We wanted to make sure we allocated sufficient time to your questions and didn't want to do a live demonstration because that's just always a little bit risky.

32:11.127 --> 32:14.188
So here's an example of creating custom groups.

32:14.709 --> 32:27.414
You can see in this case, Tina has third, fourth, and fifth graders, and she split her class into A and B. And the subjects that she has access to are math and ELA.

32:27.754 --> 32:37.779
So there's a lot of flexibility in this system that can give teachers access to the specific students and the specific data that is most appropriate for them to see.

32:39.560 --> 33:01.674
A very comprehensive set of filters that allow teachers to hone in on subgroups of students within groups to be able to identify the performance of students that they're particularly concerned about, all in an effort to improve teaching and learning and close achievement gaps, which is, it's the moral imperative that we all share.

33:04.112 --> 33:12.637
Because of the flexibility of the interims, each interim is designed to be administered, interim block is designed to be administered within approximately one class period.

33:13.277 --> 33:21.383
Sometimes students will take the same test, or different students within the same class will take the same test on different days.

33:22.303 --> 33:32.086
So to be able to look at all the students together, we needed to give a functionality to the teacher to be able to group tests together dynamically.

33:32.586 --> 33:41.249
So teachers will be able to identify the test, the particular test that was administered, in this case, in this example, fractions.

33:42.169 --> 33:48.731
She could see that some tests were administered on January 26th, some tests were administered on January 24th,

33:50.332 --> 33:58.757
She is able to highlight both of those and look at the composite performance of those students across those two testing events.

33:59.357 --> 34:15.268
She can look at the average scale score, the standard error of the mean, which is the appropriate error statistic for groups of students, the total number of students that are included in that count, and then the distribution of student scores in the categories that Mr. George referred to earlier.

34:16.449 --> 34:18.912
In the second example, there are even more tests.

34:19.553 --> 34:28.163
You can see that the number of students has increased, the average scale score has changed, and of course the distribution of student scores is also dynamically presented.

34:30.586 --> 34:33.790
When teachers want to drill in a little bit further,

34:34.430 --> 34:51.791
They can go into a particular test, they can look at the item number, the question that was presented to the student, the target and claim that that item is aligned to, and the claim, as you may recall, is a collection of a cluster of standards

34:52.171 --> 35:01.474
that is designed to represent the more holistic way in which we expect teachers to combine those standards as part of instruction, and they're more conducive to measurement.

35:01.655 --> 35:13.479
And so we want to retain the coherence of the standards while still giving the details necessary to make good decisions about whether or not students have mastered the information that they need to know.

35:14.539 --> 35:23.822
We provide then three levels of item difficulty because a lot of the information that we're providing, or most of the information we're providing, is in raw scores.

35:23.882 --> 35:29.563
So you'll see to the right, the student scores, they're integers, 0, 1, 1 or 2.

35:32.245 --> 35:34.667
And those are the raw scores or the items.

35:35.348 --> 35:40.433
As I think you're aware, we create scale scores through a very complex process.

35:40.773 --> 35:49.863
Those scale scores give a difficulty value to the items that are on a spectrum of student performance.

35:50.243 --> 36:01.831
So that adjusts, that gives the information about if a student got it right, but it was an easy item, it puts that into context more consistently.

36:02.291 --> 36:08.395
But for the interim assessment, we want to give teachers that more detailed information that might be in the raw score.

36:08.815 --> 36:15.244
but at the risk that they may misinterpret a student getting it right without knowing the difficulty of the item.

36:15.344 --> 36:17.767
So students may get the item right, but it was an easy item.

36:18.088 --> 36:20.451
They may have gotten an item wrong, but it may have been more difficult.

36:20.471 --> 36:25.258
So we provide all that information to add to her portfolio of understanding.

36:26.298 --> 36:32.680
And as additional context, we also provide the standard to which the items align.

36:33.500 --> 36:44.663
We selected many of the standards to which the item is aligned, but for many of these items, it's a subset because the targets are so holistic in many cases.

36:45.083 --> 36:55.927
that there are many standards to which the item could legitimately be aligned, but the item writers are asked to identify sometimes the primary standards, and so those are the ones that are included on the report.

36:57.047 --> 37:05.050
Further to the right, you'll see the student raw score, the maximum possible for that item, and then the correctness is the ratio between the two.

37:05.411 --> 37:11.953
That allows teachers to sort by correctness and takes then into account a value of one out of

37:12.353 --> 37:17.076
a possible max of one versus a value of one out of a possible max of two.

37:17.136 --> 37:22.539
So helping teachers hone in on where students might have struggled a little bit more clearly.

37:24.900 --> 37:39.469
On the next slide, you can see an example of how an item, and this is a fabricated item because we don't want to violate the security status of the interim on a live statewide stream.

37:41.270 --> 37:49.476
This is an example in which the student's actual response, in this case, the student chose C, is shown in the context of the actual item itself.

37:50.116 --> 37:57.341
And for text-based responses, teachers will actually see the text that the student typed in.

37:57.961 --> 38:00.183
That will be shown in the context of the item as well.

38:01.344 --> 38:25.363
The teacher can see the rubric, if it's appropriate, applicable to the item, that is the basis for how the score is derived, and then some additional item information including a more descriptive, comprehensive description of the target to which the item is aligned, the depth of knowledge, a lot of additional information that might help the teacher build in her understanding of what her students know and can do.

38:27.224 --> 38:29.826
The link to the instructional resources is really exciting.

38:30.006 --> 38:49.038
So at this point, when teachers click on that green box, it brings up a Word document which will describe the comprehensive set of resources that her peers suggest to her might be appropriate based on the performance of students in her class on that test.

38:49.238 --> 38:55.022
So as an example, a student that did really well on revising text,

38:55.662 --> 38:57.003
might be ready for enhancement.

38:57.083 --> 39:06.347
And there are resources in the digital library and suggestions in this Word document that would help the teacher engage in that enrichment process.

39:06.687 --> 39:21.714
Likewise, if the student is far below the standard, there might be suggestions for retooling or additional supports also located in the digital library that would help her increase her students' learning.

39:22.992 --> 39:30.260
So right now there's about 15 of those out of the 100 IABs, associated IABs.

39:30.641 --> 39:43.816
We engage with educators, several from California, but across the country to work on the remaining 90 or so resources that we will add into the digital library.

39:44.116 --> 40:09.265
And that's an amazing process which allows teachers to look at the standards, look at the tasks, talk with each other about how they would interpret the results if a student is high or low performing, and then dig into the digital library and add their collective wisdom, which is then made available to their peers to help them use that information to actually change their practice and help their students learn more.

40:10.145 --> 40:16.211
We expect that in the next phase of enhancements, those links will appear directly in the library.

40:16.531 --> 40:34.727
We also, rather than in a Word document, we also expect that LEAs will be able to customize the links that they want their teachers to see so that they can add their own unique expertise or their own unique resources that they want their teachers to see based on the performance of students on these tests.

40:35.807 --> 40:45.110
And with that, I can answer any questions you might have or I'm sure Mr. George and Michelle Center are available as well.

40:45.970 --> 40:46.791
Well, thank you for that.

40:46.811 --> 40:48.151
Are there board member questions?

40:49.111 --> 40:49.552
Comments?

40:50.192 --> 40:50.932
Board member Rucker?

40:53.493 --> 40:54.454
Well, good morning, Tony.

40:54.494 --> 40:55.355
It's nice to see you.

40:55.375 --> 40:56.416
Nice to see you.

40:56.476 --> 41:04.343
I just want to say as an advertisement, I'm looking forward to going to a project that you have going on later this fall.

41:04.403 --> 41:08.466
And I wanted to ask you to share a little information about that afterwards.

41:08.526 --> 41:20.237
But my particular question to you is how much of the guidance or the information that goes out to the test coordinators will give the kind of detail of information

41:20.817 --> 41:35.601
for them and for the guidance that you're giving to teachers, how has that been updated so they understand not only the new functionality, but they have a clear understanding of what their options are for using the interim assessments.

41:35.941 --> 41:49.125
Because of some interpretations of our statutes that you have nothing to do with, many districts have used the interim assessments like scheduled benchmarks and not giving teachers the flexibility

41:49.605 --> 41:57.688
to use your program in the way that it was intended and that has had some unintended outcomes and concerns that are being raised that you're addressing.

41:58.088 --> 42:15.213
But what I'm curious about is in making these changes, does that help or do you believe based on the feedback you're getting right now that that's going to aid districts in understanding that they have greater flexibility to use the tools in the way you intended and do you believe that's going to change

42:15.643 --> 42:19.339
the level of engagement that classrooms can have on this.

42:20.568 --> 42:21.429
Thank you for the question.

42:21.509 --> 42:35.721
So our goal in enhancing the reporting system is to empower teachers to use the data from the interim assessments and empower them to administer the assessments to improve student learning.

42:35.821 --> 42:48.332
So what we've heard from many educators in California is now that these enhancements are out, districts will be more likely to encourage their teachers to use the system.

42:48.772 --> 42:58.663
So I think there will be a motivation to address the issue of access and flexibility, perhaps a little bit more than there has in the past.

42:59.463 --> 43:09.234
We have worked with ETS to create an interpretive guide to help teachers understand how they might use this, the results, to change their instructional practice.

43:10.274 --> 43:19.358
It's more focused on best practices and the utility of the information that's available.

43:19.378 --> 43:24.820
It doesn't get at the administrative flexibility necessarily to which you're referring.

43:25.520 --> 43:32.163
But we also have a comprehensive user manual that Fairway Technologies address, which is also getting at the logistics.

43:32.903 --> 43:42.747
I think I probably need to defer to the department about addressing some of the different interpretations of statute that the teachers might be dealing with.

43:43.368 --> 43:49.290
In terms of your first question, I'm looking forward to your participation in that workshop as well.

43:49.890 --> 43:54.092
That is the next stage of these digital library connections.

43:54.732 --> 44:11.987
So it is this process of really building a set of experts, teachers, building their capacity to understand the measures and then asking them to collaborate with each other on giving guidance to their peers on what are appropriate next steps.

44:12.567 --> 44:25.011
which based on our pilots and our first administration of this event in September, we're hearing that from teachers that this is an amazing professional learning opportunity.

44:25.311 --> 44:27.172
So I think you're really going to enjoy that.

44:28.133 --> 44:37.767
And what we're also doing at that event is we're looking at setting new additional cut scores for grade 9 and grade 10.

44:38.188 --> 44:42.514
So as long as we're bringing a whole bunch of educators together and asking them to talk about the standards,

44:43.034 --> 44:50.740
We wanted to take the opportunity to give some additional information that teachers might use when they're administering interim assessments in grades other than 11.

44:52.001 --> 45:02.149
For your purposes, for some of our other states that have elected to administer the assessment, the summative assessment at an earlier grade, we're providing that resource for them as well.

45:02.990 --> 45:05.232
So it's a lot of things going on.

45:06.233 --> 45:12.757
The reason why I asked that question is that it's related to the second question I wanted to ask you, and it's concerning the digital library.

45:13.777 --> 45:23.724
Knowing that we had a rough start with getting teachers signed up and involved with the digital library, now that more teachers across a collection of grade spans are looking

45:24.264 --> 45:30.469
at the content, what is the plan that you have for building out the instructional resource there?

45:30.489 --> 45:44.461
Because teachers, as they're beginning, educators, let me change that, educators, as they're beginning to look in the resources in the library, and not just in the teachers and the grades, the subjects tested, but people from other content areas who are also looking there,

45:45.121 --> 45:55.167
One of the things that they are seeing is that it is kind of narrow, not only for the types of instructional resources there, but for the grade spans or the topics that are covered.

45:55.547 --> 46:10.955
So what is the plan for, I know we have a cadre of folks who are working on some of that content, but now that the access is getting wider and we're seeing better use and more frequency of use, what is the plan for building out that content?

46:12.557 --> 46:19.847
So the consortium has been working with its members for over a year on the adoption of a strategic plan.

46:20.608 --> 46:27.016
We do anticipate that in October we will have an in-person vote at what we call our collaboration conference.

46:27.716 --> 46:32.898
and embedded that as numerous strategies, several of which relate to the digital library.

46:33.518 --> 46:47.484
What we do expect is that once that plan is adopted, that members will then, will endorse by virtue of adoption of that plan, the development of more specific interim assessments.

46:48.344 --> 46:54.667
Either, right now we have interim assessments that cover four to five targets in some cases across 15 items.

46:55.867 --> 47:01.471
We will still have some of those that we'll call multi-target interim assessments, especially in ELA.

47:02.111 --> 47:03.672
Some of them are just not conducive.

47:03.832 --> 47:09.516
Some of those content elements are not conducive to being measured separately and would be potentially harmful to do so.

47:10.196 --> 47:18.782
But we will also then deploy many new interim assessments that we'll call single-target IABs, which are much more focused.

47:19.502 --> 47:34.630
Rather than in an after-the-fact manner connecting those interim assessments to the digital library, we expect that we'll co-develop resources in the digital library as we're developing the interim assessments to make that connection embedded and explicit.

47:36.114 --> 47:36.795
Thank you very much.

47:36.835 --> 47:46.063
I just want to close by telling you thank you and also acknowledging I've had a lot of support from Dr. Kirst in having conversations with you.

47:46.103 --> 47:53.110
But I want to just say that you have a lot of very smart folks around the country that I've had a chance to talk to.

47:53.610 --> 48:07.724
about the work you're doing, not only in building out these applications for the new reporting functions and developing the interactive guide, but also for doing the work to expand the system and to make the system more functional and to meet the needs of the teachers.

48:07.744 --> 48:11.587
So I want to thank you for making those folks available to talk to me.

48:12.228 --> 48:14.449
including me in some of those planning conversations.

48:14.509 --> 48:18.970
It's been a great opportunity and I have learned so much about the system.

48:19.350 --> 48:28.472
But I just have to say, and I want to make sure I say it publicly, you have some very creative and very smart folks doing the work on this.

48:28.512 --> 48:35.554
It's not a bunch of testing nerds sitting there being fascinated by what the machine can do.

48:35.894 --> 48:39.595
They really do want to think about teaching and learning

48:39.995 --> 48:44.098
and what the educators as an end user, what their environment looks like.

48:44.138 --> 48:48.561
So it's been really nice to get a chance to talk to them and to work with them on this.

48:48.761 --> 48:49.101
Thank you.

48:49.141 --> 48:51.163
And I know they appreciate working with you.

48:51.523 --> 49:02.330
I do want to take the opportunity to thank Gail Pagano and Jackie King on my staff who have been pouring their lifeblood into this system.

49:02.431 --> 49:02.891
So it is

49:03.611 --> 49:11.854
truly the result of a lot of love and care, and as you describe, an emphasis on helping teachers help students.

49:16.356 --> 49:29.401
The workshops are happening at the end of October and the beginning of November, so I think we're trying to figure out with you where to optimize your meeting.

49:32.014 --> 49:33.395
Other comments by board members?

49:33.455 --> 49:34.236
Board Member Sun.

49:34.256 --> 49:36.178
Hi.

49:37.800 --> 49:44.446
As an end user, I'm very excited about these enhancements and I can't wait to start on them this year with our school.

49:45.067 --> 49:54.597
I was actually hoping to hear a little bit more from Mr. George about how your teachers piloted, how many, how it was administered, how many times.

49:57.990 --> 50:02.194
And what you found might have been some effective practices with these enhancements?

50:02.274 --> 50:06.178
In regards to the original or the enhancements?

50:06.198 --> 50:06.859
Enhancements.

50:07.159 --> 50:12.184
So, it's been very limited up to now how much we have done work with the enhancements.

50:12.324 --> 50:16.128
We were very much engaged with the UAT phase.

50:16.609 --> 50:18.711
We had teachers and groups of educators come

50:19.384 --> 50:27.692
and take part in looking at the items, the mock-ups, and then give feedback to us that we then funneled.

50:28.253 --> 50:35.140
Prior to that, the original interim assessment system and reporting features are district-wide.

50:36.360 --> 50:59.973
The millions that Michelle referenced, I would venture to say our district accounted for many, many millions of those assessments having been given and more so the work that the teachers were doing on their own to disaggregate the data paper-wise really showed the value of the system to the point where they were investing of their professional development time to do it themselves.

51:00.433 --> 51:05.076
They were giving interim assessments two, three times the same one as a pre, post,

51:05.945 --> 51:09.507
and then after intervention type of tool.

51:10.407 --> 51:22.034
And so now the work that those same teachers did when they looked at the enhancements is what starting this week, we are starting our trainings for our teachers district-wide on the use of the enhancements this week.

51:22.534 --> 51:31.158
And so we will first train a cadre of 800 school coordinators on the use of the enhancements that will then funnel down to all the teachers at those 800 schools.

51:32.602 --> 51:40.528
And how much time would you say was saved with the enhancements and not having to sort out the data manually and do all that?

51:40.568 --> 51:43.550
So, for example, yes, that's a wonderful question.

51:43.630 --> 51:54.418
So, for example, one teacher would easily take, oh, an hour and a half to disaggregate the data from one assessment for one small class of, say, 30 students.

51:55.859 --> 52:00.963
That might not sound like a lot, but when you look at the amount of professional development time that teachers have,

52:02.048 --> 52:16.059
An hour and a half is a huge amount of an investment of their time into just disaggregating the data where they will now be able to see in a matter of five minutes of grouping their students that are theirs into the reporting system and being able to see.

52:16.419 --> 52:26.967
So easily, per interim assessment, a teacher is going to save easily an hour's worth of work in just getting the data for their students grouped into one format where they can see it.

52:27.127 --> 52:28.729
And that's just one small example.

52:29.429 --> 52:41.979
of the savings of time that the system will bring to teachers, that they could then invest in the second phase of determining what they need to put into practice to address the deficiencies or the areas of weakness of the data.

52:42.420 --> 52:55.971
And that, again, for a teacher, an hour's worth of time that they don't have to spend doing that work with the data, and they can spend doing the work of, what do I need to do to help my students in that area, is tremendous.

52:57.115 --> 53:01.277
And that has been a barrier of more fully utilizing those interim assessments.

53:01.297 --> 53:02.838
So I'm really excited about this.

53:03.118 --> 53:04.358
Definitely so, likewise.

53:05.319 --> 53:06.459
Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

53:08.520 --> 53:09.941
Congratulations on this.

53:10.001 --> 53:12.682
I know my husband's going to be thrilled to know about these enhancements.

53:13.463 --> 53:14.803
I do have two questions.

53:15.003 --> 53:18.305
One has to do with the advanced filters, which I really like.

53:18.925 --> 53:25.448
And I'm wondering if this is already done because I would love to see RFEP as one of the filters added.

53:26.986 --> 53:29.294
And slide six.

53:29.454 --> 53:30.076
Reclassified.

53:30.237 --> 53:30.458
Sorry.

53:31.829 --> 53:35.290
So yes, these filters are currently available.

53:38.830 --> 53:47.572
I don't think the reclassification data is included in the current set of data that ETS transmits along with the interim.

53:47.652 --> 53:53.713
So we'd have to have a conversation with the department and then ETS about what would it take to integrate that.

53:53.773 --> 53:57.593
And I'm not sure that that's associated with the data originally.

53:57.653 --> 54:00.534
So it might be a little bit more complex to match it all.

54:00.914 --> 54:01.234
together.

54:01.254 --> 54:13.880
I missed some of what you said, Member Rucker.

54:14.340 --> 54:20.062
So, we do have agreements to transfer data between these entities.

54:20.422 --> 54:25.985
So, we are covered by that via our contracts and written agreements.

54:26.585 --> 54:29.510
So, we can look at the data that we transfer and see if it's in there.

54:30.291 --> 54:41.408
If not, we also could advise people in the meantime to utilize their grouping feature that they can set up themselves in order to look at that group, but we will take that back.

54:42.318 --> 54:42.598
Thank you.

54:42.618 --> 54:47.663
Because I know that that's one of sort of the commitments that we made here to continue monitoring our reclassified students.

54:48.224 --> 54:50.967
And then the second question is rollout.

54:51.247 --> 54:56.813
So it seems like LAUSD is definitely running with this, but when can other districts expect to get training?

54:58.476 --> 55:05.064
So I think Tony mentioned some of the materials that Smarter is working on collaboratively with us and with ETS.

55:05.565 --> 55:11.732
In addition to that, we will be rolling out our CASP institutes and this will be a focus of the CASP institutes.

55:12.212 --> 55:17.999
We also will be talking about this at our annual North-South meeting where we train about a thousand

55:18.800 --> 55:20.101
coordinators in California.

55:20.882 --> 55:23.025
Those begin at the end of this month.

55:23.765 --> 55:29.731
So we will be utilizing various professional development and learning opportunities.

55:29.992 --> 55:31.553
We also have a clinic that's available.

55:32.054 --> 55:33.435
And then the post-test workshop.

55:35.874 --> 55:44.100
Right, so we, it's almost like I have a mini professional learning, you know, segment of my division now.

55:44.220 --> 55:49.004
And so we will be touching on this in those various settings.

55:49.444 --> 55:52.607
In addition to showing this and talking about it,

55:53.147 --> 56:08.718
We always take the opportunity to address the concern that Member Rucker brought up earlier about the intended purpose and the value that we see in this system and how that is really most valuable when you allow your educators to make those decisions.

56:11.400 --> 56:12.781
Okay, Board Member Sun.

56:14.523 --> 56:15.844
Just a quick technical question.

56:16.004 --> 56:21.748
The grouping ability for the, is it at the site level or is it at the district level?

56:23.464 --> 56:29.147
Yeah, so the delegation of authority happens from the LAA to the site.

56:29.647 --> 56:37.812
Okay, so a site coordinator can do, for example, if a site wanted to set up groups by teacher, by classroom, they could do that.

56:37.832 --> 56:38.632
Okay, so they can do that.

56:41.434 --> 56:41.614
Great.

56:41.694 --> 56:44.876
Okay, no further questions and we're ready for public comment.

56:48.318 --> 56:49.919
Would Doug McRae please line up?

56:59.117 --> 57:00.298
Good morning, I'm Doug McRae.

57:00.378 --> 57:16.330
I'm a retired testing nerd from Monterey I submitted a handout for this item for your electronic folder last Friday providing 2017 summative results for 13 Consortium states to provide context for California's pending release of results.

57:16.490 --> 57:19.813
I now have information for four additional states so I have 17 of the 21 using

57:21.714 --> 57:22.735
consortium states.

57:23.496 --> 57:42.991
Focusing on gains between 2016 and 2017, it's notable that all Smarter Balanced states except one have negative overall gain scores, with the exception of one zero gain score, while all park states except one have half positive.

57:43.912 --> 57:44.673
overall gains.

57:45.413 --> 57:55.539
This is a rather stark finding and begs the question whether the Smarter Balanced results are due to student or school performance or if they reflect a problem with the 2017 Smarter Balanced tests.

57:56.539 --> 58:05.444
I would think the latter and I'd speculate that may be due to changes involving the Computer Adaptive Item Bank 2017 summative tests.

58:06.064 --> 58:09.026
Be happy to answer questions on this context information.

58:10.527 --> 58:12.408
Okay that and a board member

58:13.649 --> 58:14.049
Go ahead.

58:15.570 --> 58:16.770
Board Member Holliday.

58:17.411 --> 58:21.372
The answer to the last question confused me though that Member Sung asked.

58:22.953 --> 58:29.235
The decision about grouping the students can happen at the teacher level.

58:29.416 --> 58:30.856
That is, is that correct?

58:32.437 --> 58:32.777
Michelle?

58:33.437 --> 58:34.898
We'll have to have somebody answer that.

58:40.064 --> 58:56.839
So, in order to protect individual students' information, someone is authorized to access all, an individual has to be authorized to access all plausible students, and that individual then allocates groups to specific teachers that may have a more restricted access.

58:58.598 --> 59:02.621
OK, so the filters are a shortcut to this process, perhaps.

59:02.701 --> 59:15.129
But at the same time, if an individual teacher wants to have a better understanding of how their students are performing based upon the composition of her classroom, right?

59:15.849 --> 59:21.572
She wants to know the kids who live on Oak Street, how are they doing versus the kids that live on Elm Street, right?

59:22.152 --> 59:29.736
So then she would have to go through the LEA coordinator or some other... Or a site coordinator.

59:29.816 --> 59:33.018
Or a site coordinator in order to have them provide that for her.

59:33.658 --> 59:35.459
But that still is possible to do that.

59:35.699 --> 59:37.900
Yeah, there's no minimum number of groups.

59:38.220 --> 59:38.440
Okay.

59:39.681 --> 59:44.425
So it's an extra step, but she can get to what she really wants.

59:44.465 --> 59:45.606
And that's the important part.

59:45.666 --> 59:45.866
Yes.

59:48.448 --> 59:48.748
Okay.

59:48.808 --> 59:50.149
Board Member Burr on this item.

59:50.409 --> 59:54.392
So Michelle, I think, are you finished with the presentation?

59:54.412 --> 59:54.613
Okay.

59:55.914 --> 01:00:06.682
I just wasn't sure where we were in the... But I do, I actually do have a question for you or maybe it's a comment and I'm not quite sure it's on this item, but I'm going to take a shot at it.

01:00:07.502 --> 01:00:25.607
First, I also want to congratulate, add my comments to member Rucker, to both Tony, the consortium, and all of our partners, ETS, and everybody on your staff, because I think, as you heard, especially from people on the ground who actually use this, this is going to be an enormous improvement.

01:00:25.627 --> 01:00:27.068
So, congratulations for that.

01:00:28.048 --> 01:00:39.257
I also want to say how much I appreciate the department's attention to the accuracy of our test results and understand that that's the reason why they're not being presented right now and are going to come later.

01:00:39.277 --> 01:00:51.346
But I just have a comment about kind of living in the past a little bit about test results and how in our prior accountability system, test results were the be-all and end-all.

01:00:51.406 --> 01:00:53.608
And so we had like a big hoop-dee-doo about it.

01:00:54.548 --> 01:00:56.530
whether it was positive or negative.

01:00:57.090 --> 01:01:11.578
And I would just like us to look at in the future when we do the dashboard release, this is a preview of Cindy's item, that we release results for all of our indicators at the same time, if that's at all possible.

01:01:11.658 --> 01:01:12.319
Because I think

01:01:13.419 --> 01:01:15.920
Because I know we do graduation rates separately.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:16.981
We do suspension.

01:01:17.141 --> 01:01:19.122
I assume we're going to do chronic absenteeism.

01:01:19.582 --> 01:01:33.588
But I think for our public and especially our parents and our community members to say, here's what the whole picture looks like at one time, it would be better than sort of having a big hoopty-doo again about test results.

01:01:33.768 --> 01:01:39.211
Sometimes I think it continues to reinforce that that's all we care about and that's not the case.

01:01:40.971 --> 01:02:03.394
Member Burr, please do know that we've had that exact conversation internally and we are talking about that and we want to make sure that we are sending consistent messages to the field about the value of multiple measures and so you know whether or not we release the assessment results separate or when we do the dashboard in the future

01:02:04.355 --> 01:02:12.704
It's important to always have that message there, and we definitely are deliberate in that, but we have also considered the approach that you mentioned.

01:02:15.817 --> 01:02:16.498
Board Member Sun.

01:02:16.738 --> 01:02:24.826
Before we end this item, I thank you Board Member Burr for reminding us of that, that this is the test results is one data point.

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:28.970
And it's a data point that is not the end and it just speaks to it.

01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:32.294
It's the beginning of what we can do to support our students.

01:02:32.694 --> 01:02:38.380
And to that, I really want to express my appreciation to Michelle, your team,

01:02:39.221 --> 01:02:47.388
In getting the test results out to the sites and the LEAs so quickly, we were getting our results in June.

01:02:48.209 --> 01:02:51.152
And we had the vast majority June, July, they trickled in.

01:02:51.392 --> 01:03:02.783
And we were able to start the school year with good data on where our students, how our students performed to help us start the interventions and to work with our students moving into the very beginning of the school year.

01:03:03.263 --> 01:03:05.344
We never had that under the old system.

01:03:05.424 --> 01:03:10.986
So it's great to be able to have that and be able to have utilized that data right away.

01:03:11.486 --> 01:03:12.526
So we have a fresh start.

01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:20.409
I think what's important about that, Member Sun is that, you know, you had no prohibition about using those results.

01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:28.112
Districts are not waiting for us to release the results on our public website to use the data.

01:03:28.212 --> 01:03:29.732
They are using the data now.

01:03:30.032 --> 01:03:31.393
They have been using the data.

01:03:33.052 --> 01:03:34.594
Yeah, that's very good clarification.

01:03:35.595 --> 01:03:35.895
Go ahead.

01:03:38.137 --> 01:03:45.785
Thank you so much for all the work that you're doing and thinking about this in the spirit of formative assessments and that scoring has been the issue.

01:03:45.805 --> 01:03:54.854
So this efficiency that you've, I mean the time in scoring is what I mean, but the efficiency that you've done is really a hallmark of the effort that you and your team have put together.

01:03:55.534 --> 01:04:11.565
So in thinking about, you know, the PLC process, the professional learning community of teachers gathering around the data and looking at it, there was probably a window of time when districts at the beginning looked at the interims, looked at the digital library, took a peek, and then decided to not do it at that time.

01:04:12.066 --> 01:04:17.109
So I'm assuming that there's a cadre of users and there's a base number for that.

01:04:17.229 --> 01:04:21.152
And there's also a group, a large group probably, that aren't using that.

01:04:21.172 --> 01:04:23.614
And so in your rebranding or in your rollout,

01:04:24.134 --> 01:04:38.788
really think about not only how to let current consumers know about it, but how do we, and I know through the statewide meetings and so forth, how do we get other districts who have, who either took a peek and decided they had something else that this is really about.

01:04:39.348 --> 01:04:40.189
a viable tool.

01:04:40.249 --> 01:04:50.320
And so that's just something to think about in terms of that campaign of really getting districts to see the value and see it as a formative opportunity.

01:04:50.461 --> 01:04:51.382
So thank you so much.

01:04:51.422 --> 01:04:53.023
So I don't know what the usage is.

01:04:53.043 --> 01:04:54.285
That would be interesting to know.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:59.481
It depends on which vehicle you're talking about.

01:04:59.541 --> 01:05:10.643
In terms of the digital library, it's very difficult to determine usage because you could have a single lead teacher who's actually doing the access that is actually implementing something for an entire grade.

01:05:11.103 --> 01:05:16.004
And so those numbers are a little more difficult to get in terms of the digital library.

01:05:16.044 --> 01:05:21.005
But in terms of interim assessments, I presented some numbers for you.

01:05:21.665 --> 01:05:23.386
So, that is being widely used.

01:05:23.546 --> 01:05:48.535
I think that we have a particular group in California, it's called our Regional Assessment Network, which is made up of county leads and we meet with them regularly and I think this is an important topic that I will bring to them about how they could assist us and really reaching out to those districts that may have decided not to use those based on the prior reporting system and make sure that everyone knows about these new enhancements and have that decision-making opportunity again.

01:05:50.802 --> 01:05:51.022
All right.

01:05:51.062 --> 01:05:52.162
I think that ends that item.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:56.603
I'm very impressed with the expertise on this board in terms of getting into this in depth.

01:05:56.723 --> 01:05:58.404
I'm learning a lot from the members.

01:05:58.424 --> 01:05:59.884
Okay.

01:05:59.904 --> 01:06:01.084
We're on to item two.

01:06:01.524 --> 01:06:08.206
And that is the recommended action and update on the development of our accountability system.

01:06:08.606 --> 01:06:18.128
When we approved the accountability system required by LCFF, the board also approved an annual review process for considering improvements.

01:06:19.168 --> 01:06:22.950
The California dashboard was field tested this past spring.

01:06:23.771 --> 01:06:28.793
And this fall will be our first operational year under accountability system.

01:06:29.654 --> 01:06:39.179
So, this is the update on the first annual review and we will have recommendations and actions on revisions and the calculations of the state indicators.

01:06:39.239 --> 01:06:41.360
So, Cindy Kazanis is here to present.

01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:44.282
And then we'll hear from our liaisons on this.

01:06:44.622 --> 01:06:44.962
Go ahead.

01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:50.631
Thank you, President Kurst and members of the board and Chief Deputy Price.

01:06:50.832 --> 01:06:51.872
It's a pleasure to be here.

01:06:51.912 --> 01:06:57.214
I'm Cindy Kazanis, the Director of the Analysis Measurement and Accountability Reporting Division.

01:06:58.614 --> 01:07:02.056
I see today as sort of a culmination of a year-long process.

01:07:02.256 --> 01:07:11.119
Last September, you approved the metrics of the dashboard and you asked us to develop a work plan that we needed to get a lot of things done by

01:07:11.639 --> 01:07:15.520
this first year of operational results for the dashboard.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:20.061
So for the last year, we have engaged with numerous stakeholders.

01:07:20.301 --> 01:07:22.582
We have put together three different work groups.

01:07:22.802 --> 01:07:26.763
We've actually overworked our technical design group this year.

01:07:26.803 --> 01:07:29.163
We actually, I think, doubled or tripled their meetings.

01:07:29.864 --> 01:07:31.644
But everybody really stepped up to the plate.

01:07:31.764 --> 01:07:35.605
And I want to acknowledge the work of Jenny Singh and her staff.

01:07:36.325 --> 01:07:43.909
Jonathan Eisler of my staff, Randy Bunnell, their leadership and the team of my division has been phenomenal.

01:07:44.129 --> 01:07:47.271
And we have a lot of work to do prior to December.

01:07:47.791 --> 01:07:50.232
So I won't tell you the work is done.

01:07:50.392 --> 01:07:51.173
The work is ongoing.

01:07:51.193 --> 01:07:52.613
You're going to hear that in a couple slides.

01:07:53.414 --> 01:07:58.116
But we also have partners throughout this department and we couldn't do it without our program experts.

01:07:58.156 --> 01:08:01.538
And so you're going to hear from a couple of them today as well as I present this item.

01:08:02.932 --> 01:08:07.356
So to get us started, there are nine attachments that were in your item.

01:08:07.936 --> 01:08:11.259
And some of them were shorter than others.

01:08:11.719 --> 01:08:15.122
But we will go through most of them individually.

01:08:15.182 --> 01:08:17.624
So I won't walk through them in this overview slide.

01:08:17.644 --> 01:08:21.888
But of the nine attachments, there are going to be five actions.

01:08:22.448 --> 01:08:31.576
So the actions that we're going to ask you to take is on the English Learner Progress Indicator, on the Academic Indicator, the Career and College Indicator,

01:08:32.517 --> 01:08:36.624
And for small populations, we're going to bring you a proposal as well that Jenny is going to walk through.

01:08:37.205 --> 01:08:43.636
And then finally, we're going to ask you to take action on something you considered in July, which was the dashboard alternative school status.

01:08:45.536 --> 01:08:57.805
You will not be taking action on the academic indicator as far as inclusion of 2016-17 Smarter Balanced scores, nor will you be taking action on the chronic absenteeism data.

01:08:57.885 --> 01:09:01.108
Those are two points of data that we've only gotten within the last couple of weeks.

01:09:01.348 --> 01:09:07.732
We need time to work through the issues around our, you know, we need to do our analysis.

01:09:07.792 --> 01:09:09.814
We also want to take that to our technical design group.

01:09:10.274 --> 01:09:17.019
in late October, and we will be engaging with stakeholders as time permits on these as well.

01:09:17.119 --> 01:09:22.743
So those are two pieces that I'm previewing for you that we will pick up in November.

01:09:23.604 --> 01:09:29.669
And more critically, we can't actually release the dashboard publicly until you make decisions on both of those indicators.

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:31.250
So I want to emphasize that too.

01:09:33.317 --> 01:09:36.619
So attachment one, it covers the English Learner Progress Indicator.

01:09:36.899 --> 01:09:46.004
And my colleague Veronica Aguilar from our English Learner Support Division provided you an excellent overview two meetings ago back in May.

01:09:46.044 --> 01:09:47.704
I know there was a couple of you we have.

01:09:47.965 --> 01:09:52.787
Our student member is new, but I think member Valdez may have been out as well.

01:09:52.867 --> 01:09:56.769
But we did provide you a really, like I said, detailed overview.

01:09:56.789 --> 01:10:00.391
So I'm not going to spend as much time on this, but I do want to cover the key points.

01:10:01.011 --> 01:10:15.338
So, last July, in adopting what we are calling the LP, you asked us to come in a workgroup of experts to talk about reporting long-term English learner data for accountability purposes in this indicator.

01:10:15.958 --> 01:10:17.359
So, we put together a workgroup.

01:10:17.399 --> 01:10:22.281
We brought them together in person several times in Sacramento.

01:10:22.721 --> 01:10:29.845
We also provided you updates throughout the workgroup meeting and then maybe provided you the culmination of their recommendations.

01:10:30.545 --> 01:10:36.966
What we also put forward to the CPAC, those same recommendations, into our technical design group.

01:10:37.446 --> 01:10:48.149
And you can see on this slide, the recommendation is simply to provide extra credit for LTELs in the LP who advance at least one level on the California English Language Development Test.

01:10:48.989 --> 01:10:54.630
They also supported providing additional EL and LTEL data reports in DataQuest and on the dashboard.

01:10:55.390 --> 01:11:03.120
So with that recommendation, the formula looks a little different than in the spring dashboard.

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:11.490
The green, which is the addition, is again adding LTEL CELT test takers who increased at least one level on the CELT.

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:19.367
What this will affect, and I like this slide a lot, but I want to caution you, this is using old data.

01:11:19.587 --> 01:11:26.916
So this is using the Spring Dashboard, how this would affect those particular schools.

01:11:26.957 --> 01:11:32.684
We would actually see schools change in color, a total of 63 schools would change in color.

01:11:33.144 --> 01:11:36.587
by adding this extra credit to the formula.

01:11:37.048 --> 01:11:40.451
So this could be lower or it could be higher with the fall dashboard.

01:11:40.511 --> 01:11:47.838
But we know that it helps at least 63 and for that I think that the workgroup and the department thinks it's important to move forward with this recommendation.

01:11:54.161 --> 01:11:57.582
The second attachment is regarding the California Alternate Assessments.

01:11:58.363 --> 01:12:04.105
California Alternate Assessments are given to students who have the most significant cognitive disability.

01:12:04.145 --> 01:12:05.745
So it's our 1% of students.

01:12:06.266 --> 01:12:14.569
I do have Kristen Wright in the audience who's prepared to help with this item as well as Michelle Center and technical staff from ETS.

01:12:15.589 --> 01:12:28.752
So when you approved in January the academic indicator, you asked us to come back in September to see if we could incorporate the California alternate assessment into the academic indicator.

01:12:29.692 --> 01:12:36.474
We've talked to the technical design group a couple of times about being able to do that for this fall.

01:12:36.914 --> 01:12:44.516
They've actually recommended postponing this incorporation because they think that there needs to be additional years of operational data.

01:12:45.616 --> 01:12:50.218
And so the multi-year rollout of the test design needs to be more complete.

01:12:50.698 --> 01:12:55.120
There are also some technical challenges that the technical design group will need to help us overcome.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:04.644
So between our testing contractor and our assessments division, we've had some discussions about the fact that the reporting structures are different.

01:13:04.704 --> 01:13:08.306
So just some technical considerations that we need some more time to examine.

01:13:08.726 --> 01:13:10.087
So the recommendation is to

01:13:11.207 --> 01:13:21.332
Wait until we have additional years of data to perform simulations and evaluate options for reporting a change for a valid denominator.

01:13:21.773 --> 01:13:25.955
So it's going to take us, I think, at least another year to work through this information.

01:13:28.576 --> 01:13:36.200
recommendations that we got from the Chair of your Advisory Commission on Special Education was to report out on the scores for these students.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:46.965
So whether, while they cannot be included at this time, we don't think in the academic indicator, we'd like to see at least an acknowledgement of these students taking an exam that's aligned to our current standards.

01:13:47.445 --> 01:13:56.970
So that's the recommendation from the department moving forward for, at least for the alternate assessments incorporation into the academic indicator.

01:14:00.134 --> 01:14:04.155
The third attachment and the fourth attachment both cover the college career indicator.

01:14:04.735 --> 01:14:16.057
And keep in mind the purpose of this indicator is to emphasize that a high school diploma should represent the completion of a broad course of study and rigorous course of study to prepare students for college and career.

01:14:16.937 --> 01:14:22.558
We were pleased to see that nationally we're being recognized for our work in this area.

01:14:22.598 --> 01:14:28.019
The Bellwether education partners noted that the college career indicator was a high set.

01:14:28.879 --> 01:14:37.222
a high-quality set of accountability indicators that will measure student performance against college career readiness benchmarks.

01:14:37.422 --> 01:14:44.085
So, you know, there's a lot of states that are struggling to put this indicator together like we have.

01:14:44.105 --> 01:14:45.585
We've been working on this since 2014.

01:14:46.566 --> 01:14:54.749
But to be recognized for the metrics that you've approved last September, it's nice to get to recognize that we're headed in the right direction.

01:14:55.717 --> 01:15:02.026
With that in mind, we have a couple of pieces we want to talk to you about.

01:15:02.987 --> 01:15:05.030
This particular attachment is going to be for action.

01:15:05.070 --> 01:15:11.139
And then Donna Wyatt, my colleague from the College Career Transitions Division, will be presenting on the three-year plan.

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:16.142
So last September, we brought to you the indicator for college career.

01:15:16.443 --> 01:15:24.967
You approved status cut scores based on our prior assessment, the standardized testing and reporting star early assessment program.

01:15:25.908 --> 01:15:32.431
So you had asked us at that time, you knew that the data was old, and we have a new system that's aligned to current standards.

01:15:32.831 --> 01:15:33.972
So you asked us to bring this back.

01:15:34.212 --> 01:15:38.475
And we are bringing this back, and we're asking you to consider changing the status cut scores.

01:15:39.475 --> 01:15:44.858
These next couple of slides give you an idea of what the change looks like and why we're making the change.

01:15:45.478 --> 01:15:55.763
So if we think back several years ago when we had STAR EAP, I think it's been three or four years now since we've offered it, it was optional for grade 11 students.

01:15:55.983 --> 01:15:58.764
Smarter Balance is required for all grade 11 students.

01:15:59.084 --> 01:16:01.846
So we actually have a larger universe of students taking this assessment.

01:16:02.986 --> 01:16:13.112
STAR, EAP, and math was only available to students who had completed or were currently enrolled in advanced math courses, whereas Smarter Balanced math is available to all students.

01:16:13.993 --> 01:16:27.000
And then EAP was optional, so students could elect to complete the EAP section to receive a determination whether or not they were college career ready, whereas now it's embedded into the assessments.

01:16:27.481 --> 01:16:31.003
So all students receive a determination whether they're ready for college.

01:16:31.513 --> 01:16:39.077
So those are, I think, really important notables as you think about how different what you approved last September is to this September.

01:16:40.158 --> 01:16:58.428
The technical design group, as a result of looking at the new assessment scores for Smarter Balanced for the class of 2016, is suggesting, and the department is recommending as well, that the status cut scores be changed to reflect the first year students who took, again, the Smarter Balanced assessments.

01:16:59.148 --> 01:17:01.430
And so what does this look like for the coming year?

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:05.954
Because right now, we will be using the class of 2016 data.

01:17:06.255 --> 01:17:08.557
You'll only see in the fall status.

01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:14.202
You will not see a performance color because we don't have another year to compare it to the same group of data.

01:17:14.823 --> 01:17:16.404
We have not yet processed our cohort.

01:17:16.444 --> 01:17:18.086
We have the data, we haven't processed our cohort.

01:17:20.368 --> 01:17:23.632
I'll show you on the next couple of slides what this will look like on the dashboard.

01:17:23.972 --> 01:17:32.863
We want to make sure that we provide the public with more information than we were able to do in the spring dashboard.

01:17:33.464 --> 01:17:35.226
In fact, we want to be able to show

01:17:35.806 --> 01:17:46.656
how students were labeled as prepared, because there are five different options of demonstrating preparedness, as well as approaching prepared and not prepared.

01:17:47.376 --> 01:17:48.737
So what will next year look like?

01:17:48.857 --> 01:17:53.401
The fall 2018 dashboard will actually be able to skip ahead a cohort.

01:17:53.501 --> 01:18:00.888
We are automating a report in CALPADS that we've had to do manually all these years for our cohort data.

01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:08.731
And by automating that report, it's our intent to be able to put out the data for the cohort in the year that they graduated.

01:18:09.191 --> 01:18:12.732
So novel idea, but it's taken us a while to get there.

01:18:13.132 --> 01:18:18.854
But what that will mean is we'll actually skip over, we'll be able to leapfrog into 2018.

01:18:19.634 --> 01:18:25.216
So you'll see status for class of 2018 compared to class of 2017 for change.

01:18:25.676 --> 01:18:30.098
So next fall, the goal is to have a color for this indicator.

01:18:31.159 --> 01:18:42.610
And so, again, this is why I think it's so important that we start off with the status this year showing appropriate cut scores for the smarter balance assessments.

01:18:44.431 --> 01:18:47.512
So this is what a report may look like in the dashboard.

01:18:48.393 --> 01:18:57.696
In this report, we're using a table that looks a little different than we have, I think, it gives in the dashboard in general.

01:18:58.116 --> 01:19:03.759
But for this particular sample district, for prepared students, it was almost 50% of their population.

01:19:04.459 --> 01:19:05.339
Only 1.5% were prepared based on

01:19:07.541 --> 01:19:09.604
career technical education pathway completion.

01:19:10.104 --> 01:19:22.181
Majority of them, not the majority, most of them were prepared by showing that they met at least level three standard met on ELA or mathematics for smarter balance.

01:19:23.002 --> 01:19:27.125
A small minority was enrolled in dual enrollment, two semesters or three quarters.

01:19:27.605 --> 01:19:41.374
And then you can see gradually reaches up to students who were able to demonstrate preparedness by having passing scores on the advanced placement or international baccalaureate tests.

01:19:41.474 --> 01:19:51.481
And then finally, that they completed A through G plus something else, because A through G alone does not demonstrate that you're prepared in the college career indicator.

01:19:53.069 --> 01:20:01.659
So a different sample district, or it may be the same one, I can't remember where we got this data from, I think we probably made it up, is showing approaching prepared.

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:08.167
So again, you can see the numbers drastically reduced, but there's 20% that are approaching prepared.

01:20:08.527 --> 01:20:12.669
So this is just, again, it's a visual for folks to be able to see.

01:20:12.689 --> 01:20:23.413
We're teasing out the data because the data by itself of just approaching prepared doesn't, I think, give you a true picture of how students are doing at the high school level.

01:20:23.513 --> 01:20:25.494
So that's what this is intended to do.

01:20:27.175 --> 01:20:32.497
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Donna Wyatt to present the three-year plan for the college career indicator.

01:20:36.124 --> 01:20:36.764
Thank you, Cindy.

01:20:37.104 --> 01:20:39.625
Good morning, President Kurst, Chief Price, board members.

01:20:40.465 --> 01:20:45.847
The work in the Career and College Transition Division is focused on two career readiness indicators right now.

01:20:46.327 --> 01:20:49.909
The work-based learning and industry certification and stackable credentials.

01:20:51.049 --> 01:20:54.610
Work-based learning, the work is identifying the continuum.

01:20:55.070 --> 01:21:02.553
We are outreaching to stakeholders, those districts and county offices that have showing or are showing some expertise in work-based learning.

01:21:03.133 --> 01:21:12.760
So what are all of those experiences from career awareness all the way up to career preparation and entering the workforce?

01:21:13.661 --> 01:21:17.744
So identifying the experiences and then putting indicators to those.

01:21:18.144 --> 01:21:21.567
What are the quality indicators for a guest speaker in a classroom?

01:21:21.727 --> 01:21:24.129
What are the quality indicators for an internship?

01:21:25.066 --> 01:21:26.867
And then finally, what are the outcomes?

01:21:26.927 --> 01:21:34.714
What are the differences that we're going to see in those students as they experience and take part in that full continuum of experiences?

01:21:35.614 --> 01:21:39.517
With regards to internships, that's really part of the continuum.

01:21:39.597 --> 01:21:41.599
Internships are kind of the gold standard.

01:21:41.639 --> 01:21:45.382
They are the culminating event to that series of work-based learning experiences.

01:21:45.522 --> 01:21:49.825
It's what we work towards in the classroom to get students ready for.

01:21:50.786 --> 01:22:01.056
Industry certifications are a combination of working with organizations like NOCTI or CTEX who have those standardized types of assessments.

01:22:01.637 --> 01:22:04.400
But it's also about building stackable credentials.

01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:09.665
So many industry certifications are not available to students until they're 18 and above.

01:22:10.326 --> 01:22:12.188
Well, that's our community college partners.

01:22:12.768 --> 01:22:21.255
What can we build in K through 12 that allows students to build their skills, build their knowledge towards that industry certification?

01:22:21.816 --> 01:22:24.318
An example might be in a health pathway.

01:22:24.919 --> 01:22:26.700
A student enters in 10th grade.

01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:31.704
They take a Red Cross certification, CPR certification, layman's course.

01:22:32.465 --> 01:22:39.231
11th grade, they might take a CPR course, but now it's for professional rescuers or professional health care providers.

01:22:39.931 --> 01:22:40.452
12th grade,

01:22:41.129 --> 01:22:46.333
then they're maybe entering into a dual enrollment course in EMT or emergency medical responders.

01:22:46.473 --> 01:22:52.818
So it's building that sequence up to the point where the student can then take that industry certification at the age of 18.

01:22:54.875 --> 01:23:15.354
Moving on into what's included currently, articulated courses, where school districts and community colleges come together around courses and build the courses together and have agreements that students who take those courses in high school are also earning college credit through oftentimes an exam or perhaps

01:23:16.295 --> 01:23:18.616
attaining a certain grade in that course.

01:23:19.317 --> 01:23:21.158
The state seal of biliteracy.

01:23:21.918 --> 01:23:27.281
The standalone courses we're further exploring, an example of that might be a nursing assistant course.

01:23:28.181 --> 01:23:37.126
A semester long course that students take that prepare them with the skills and the knowledge necessary to take the state exam to become a certified nurse assistant.

01:23:37.646 --> 01:23:43.069
Well, that has all of the components of a high quality CTE program and a career measure.

01:23:44.173 --> 01:23:46.814
But we're not quite ready to take that step yet.

01:23:46.874 --> 01:23:47.954
That's coming further down.

01:23:48.735 --> 01:23:50.935
And then going further on, military.

01:23:51.396 --> 01:23:56.637
Everything from the reserve officer training, ROTC, to acceptance to the military.

01:23:56.997 --> 01:24:01.379
It's not currently collected in CALPADS, but we do collect it as part of our Perkins grant.

01:24:01.779 --> 01:24:07.241
It is one of the indicators that we collect for completion of a CTE sequence.

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:29.730
So the other thing I wanted to note with the College Career Indicator is we've engaged our Alternative Schools Task Force to think about ways that alternative schools could also demonstrate preparedness for a college career.

01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:35.556
You know, oftentimes they may only have six months or a year with a student, but that is valuable time.

01:24:35.596 --> 01:24:36.036
And in fact,

01:24:36.997 --> 01:24:44.841
I think we heard an anecdotal story that they have more internships or they have higher participation in dual enrollment than traditional schools.

01:24:44.901 --> 01:24:48.863
So we are finding out a wealth of information from that Alternative Schools Task Force.

01:24:48.923 --> 01:25:00.449
And so in relation to college career, I wanted to make sure that you were aware that we've been also focused on what we're going to bring forward to you a year from now in terms of the Alternative Schools Indicator.

01:25:00.969 --> 01:25:03.491
And then the other piece, too, is that we've brought this

01:25:04.491 --> 01:25:14.616
this information as well to the Advisory Commission on Special Education because again the same concerns with different populations of students being able to demonstrate preparedness.

01:25:15.016 --> 01:25:19.298
These may not be the metrics that we would advise that we use for those populations.

01:25:19.378 --> 01:25:24.240
So we are being cognizant of the fact that we do have a

01:25:26.901 --> 01:25:30.603
percentage of the students that are enrolled in our alternative schools.

01:25:30.663 --> 01:25:35.927
And so as we develop out this three-year plan, we will also keep that in mind moving forward.

01:25:36.347 --> 01:25:44.752
So with that, I wanted to move on to the schools with small populations and Jenny Singh of the Academic Accountability Unit will be presenting this piece.

01:25:50.247 --> 01:25:51.148
Good morning, everyone.

01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:55.211
So I'm going to present the schools with small populations.

01:25:55.752 --> 01:26:13.428
So you may recall that when we first started presenting simulations and results to the board in regards to the indicators, we had a lot of stakeholders raise concerns about schools with small end size being over-identified in the red performance level.

01:26:14.248 --> 01:26:17.591
And, of course, we produced disseminations and we saw this as well.

01:26:18.772 --> 01:26:26.157
So, we agreed that we would look at ways of addressing this issue.

01:26:26.638 --> 01:26:27.799
Now, this isn't anything new.

01:26:27.979 --> 01:26:30.241
We did this for AYP and we did it for API.

01:26:30.341 --> 01:26:36.685
We had alternative methods that we used to hold harmless schools with small in sizes.

01:26:37.486 --> 01:26:45.509
So we did look at multiple methodologies, I think four or five different ones, and we brought them to our technical design group.

01:26:46.209 --> 01:26:56.494
But as we were also looking at these methodologies, we also realized that schools with small populations were also being over-identified in the blue performance level.

01:27:00.075 --> 01:27:02.516
But we didn't have many stakeholders point that out to us.

01:27:04.838 --> 01:27:11.843
So we did realize that we had to have a methodology that really did limit the extreme changes on both ends.

01:27:12.324 --> 01:27:15.366
And so we are referring to this as the safety net.

01:27:18.226 --> 01:27:24.648
So the safety net methodology removes the increase significantly or the decrease significantly change levels.

01:27:24.748 --> 01:27:27.629
Now we're only focusing on change, we're not focusing on status.

01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:29.910
This is only relevant to change.

01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:37.193
So for schools with small populations, they can only receive an increase level, a maintain level, or a decrease level.

01:27:38.493 --> 01:27:42.096
So the five by five grid actually becomes a three by five grid.

01:27:42.896 --> 01:27:51.261
Schools and districts can still receive any of the five colors, I mean they still can receive all five colors, but their placement on the grid is going to be limited.

01:27:51.922 --> 01:27:53.883
So we have an example of what that looks like here.

01:27:54.203 --> 01:27:58.786
So we're just removing the decline significantly and the increase significantly and narrowing that box.

01:27:59.166 --> 01:28:03.649
You can see you can still receive a red, an orange, a yellow, a green, or a blue.

01:28:06.829 --> 01:28:17.294
So we did conduct quite a few analysis to determine if schools with small populations were being over identified in the red and blue performance level.

01:28:17.374 --> 01:28:21.056
But we wanted to make sure to conduct that analysis on all the state indicators.

01:28:21.776 --> 01:28:24.357
So we did conduct an analysis for all state indicators.

01:28:24.818 --> 01:28:35.883
And then we applied the three by five grid to all state indicators because we had that request from our technical design group and from representatives of small schools and small school districts.

01:28:37.004 --> 01:28:39.285
So we did present them with that information.

01:28:40.106 --> 01:28:44.329
We did the analysis using two end sizes, 150 and 250.

01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:53.276
And this was to accommodate the two different requests that we received, one from the TDG and the other from the small school representatives.

01:28:56.425 --> 01:29:05.049
So the TDG really felt that it was important that the end size be based on the denominator for each indicator.

01:29:06.050 --> 01:29:08.431
And this is really important because our indicators vary.

01:29:08.671 --> 01:29:13.814
And in California, we have a very diverse set of schools that serve different grade spans.

01:29:14.194 --> 01:29:19.076
We have K-2 schools, we have K-12 schools, we have 7-12 schools.

01:29:19.096 --> 01:29:21.357
We have a really diverse set of schools.

01:29:21.778 --> 01:29:24.179
So we didn't want to base it on enrollment only.

01:29:24.759 --> 01:29:28.762
So you can see here that the denominator is determined differently for each indicator.

01:29:29.082 --> 01:29:32.064
For the graduation rate, we have the number of students in the cohort.

01:29:33.205 --> 01:29:36.388
For the LP, it's the number of CELT test takers.

01:29:36.968 --> 01:29:40.070
For ELA and math, it's the number of valid scores.

01:29:40.150 --> 01:29:44.253
Remember, valid scores are based on the number of students who are continuously enrolled.

01:29:45.595 --> 01:29:49.598
And then suspension is based on the number of students who are cumulatively enrolled.

01:29:50.138 --> 01:29:51.239
And so this can make a difference.

01:29:51.459 --> 01:29:59.306
I indicated this in the item itself, is that you can have a school that has a very large population.

01:30:00.247 --> 01:30:08.413
For instance, there's a pre, starting with primary, preschool all the way to 12th grade.

01:30:09.154 --> 01:30:11.095
And this school may have a large population.

01:30:11.356 --> 01:30:12.617
It does have a large population, 2,800.

01:30:14.458 --> 01:30:20.404
But when you look at grades 9 through 12, the population then drops significantly to 600.

01:30:21.145 --> 01:30:24.108
But remember, the graduation rate is based on a cohort.

01:30:24.328 --> 01:30:26.510
So you're only looking at one grade.

01:30:26.951 --> 01:30:29.614
So you're looking at those students who first entered ninth grade.

01:30:30.374 --> 01:30:35.257
and then if they completed their, received a diploma by the end of four years.

01:30:35.437 --> 01:30:37.198
So the number drastically shrinks.

01:30:37.278 --> 01:30:44.883
So for this school, we're talking about 134 students in the cohort and they would then be eligible for the three by five.

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:56.069
So the small school stakeholders group and the California Practitioners Advisory Group provided the following feedback on the safety net.

01:30:56.189 --> 01:31:00.174
They wanted to use the 3x5 grid only for suspension and graduation rate.

01:31:00.654 --> 01:31:03.598
We noticed that this is where the biggest problems were between

01:31:05.019 --> 01:31:07.260
small schools and schools that were non-small schools.

01:31:08.021 --> 01:31:18.725
We also did look at student groups and we noticed that there wasn't a problem, which is a little surprising, but we wanted to be cautious on moving forward with this.

01:31:19.205 --> 01:31:24.728
We can always add in the three by five if we discover that we need it for other indicators or for student groups.

01:31:24.768 --> 01:31:29.070
So we decided to start off with suspension and the graduation rate indicators.

01:31:30.010 --> 01:31:42.038
And they wanted to use this methodology starting in the fall of 2017 for the release because we have single school districts who are small and we don't want to identify them incorrectly for support.

01:31:42.558 --> 01:31:44.619
And they did recommend an end size of 250.

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:57.548
The TDG concurred with the first two bullets but recommended an end size of 150 because that's based on our statistical analysis, our chi-square and our z-score analysis.

01:31:58.748 --> 01:32:12.895
And so that is the recommendation that we're bringing forth and with that I'd be happy to answer any questions Okay, I think we're ready then for questions on any aspect of this Sorry, we do have two more slides to go and then we'll take questions at the very end.

01:32:13.115 --> 01:32:22.900
I apologize So the last two rather last three pieces this is this particular one attachment 7 is the last of the

01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:24.861
action items.

01:32:25.582 --> 01:32:40.074
And in July of 2017, this last board meeting, you did approve the criteria for the dashboard alternate school status, DAS, which replaces the alternative accountability school model, ASAM.

01:32:40.815 --> 01:32:50.303
Following your decision, actually, I think two days later, we got an inquiry from a colleague who said that one of the new definitions singled out students with disabilities

01:32:50.723 --> 01:32:53.705
or rather disability category, which was emotionally disturbed students.

01:32:54.285 --> 01:33:01.290
And they thought that it was inappropriate and suggested we take the criteria back again to the Advisory Commission on Special Education.

01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:06.613
Keep in mind we had taken this criteria to them in June and somehow everybody missed this.

01:33:07.193 --> 01:33:26.605
So I know that member Sandoval was present but there was a robust discussion at the Advisory Commission on Special Education and the members did want to recommend to you that this category be removed and the department does agree with the commission on that particular recommendation.

01:33:27.385 --> 01:33:30.148
We are currently collecting applications for DAS.

01:33:30.308 --> 01:33:33.250
They are due to the department October 6th.

01:33:33.911 --> 01:33:41.697
At this point, we are not seeing any schools that would not be eligible just based on removal of this criteria.

01:33:41.717 --> 01:33:48.583
They oftentimes are multiple ways to get to the 70% threshold that you adopted back in July.

01:33:50.549 --> 01:33:54.274
And with that, there's just two more slides to present.

01:33:54.795 --> 01:33:57.579
Jeff Breshears will present attachment eight, and then I'll present attachment nine.

01:34:00.848 --> 01:34:04.370
Good morning, Jeff Pachears, the Director of the Local Agency Systems Support Office.

01:34:04.450 --> 01:34:08.753
Just a real quick update on the local indicators for Priority 6 and 7.

01:34:09.513 --> 01:34:20.900
Priority 6, the School Climate Conditions and Climate Work Group have been working and meeting to further develop the school conditions and climate measures in our system.

01:34:21.847 --> 01:34:25.389
They've taken a lot of stakeholder feedback.

01:34:25.429 --> 01:34:28.811
They presented a memorandum in June, have taken that feedback.

01:34:28.831 --> 01:34:34.474
They're going to meet again in the 25th of this month and then present findings.

01:34:34.494 --> 01:34:42.378
They've also presented to CPAG and have received a lot of feedback from their work and where they're moving forward on these recommendations.

01:34:43.179 --> 01:34:48.702
We'll present a memorandum in October and I think they're bringing forth a recommendation in November.

01:34:50.672 --> 01:35:02.599
For Priority 7, we anticipate coming to you next in November, the next meeting, and ask for you to approve the inclusion of the local indicator for Priority 7 access to a broad course of study.

01:35:03.599 --> 01:35:15.446
With that, I have you approve a standard very similar to the other local indicator standards that you have, and then also show you a draft of the local indicator self-reflection tool for Priority 7.

01:35:15.566 --> 01:35:15.986
From that,

01:35:16.696 --> 01:35:38.377
We will take that if you approve and we're moving forward through November through March, I mean February, we'll engage in stakeholder feedback to further develop and fine tune that self-reflection tool for priority seven and then bring that hopefully final tool back to you in March for the inclusion in the fall 18 dashboard.

01:35:39.137 --> 01:35:39.358
Thanks.

01:35:47.972 --> 01:35:48.312
Excellent.

01:35:48.472 --> 01:35:51.593
And then to finish off, we do have a dashboard release coming.

01:35:52.293 --> 01:35:57.395
We are looking, our end goal is to get it out the week of November 27th.

01:35:57.575 --> 01:36:04.037
In order to meet that goal, we are approaching our private preview a little differently than we did this past spring.

01:36:04.557 --> 01:36:09.559
We are anticipating that we can do a rolling weekly release of indicators.

01:36:09.679 --> 01:36:13.440
So we're looking at two per week, starting with the first week of November.

01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:22.323
And we think that by doing this rolling release to LEAs, it'll get them time to get comfortable with the data.

01:36:22.543 --> 01:36:31.886
We are thinking at this time that the first two would be the graduation cohort and the college career indicators to really focus on the information that they may not have seen before or focused on in spring.

01:36:33.627 --> 01:36:46.250
Again, depending on your actions in your November meeting on the academic and chronic absenteeism indicators, we would then do a very quick turnaround before Thanksgiving and get that final set of data out.

01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:56.392
So as we think about the launch and the next item you're going to hear, I wanted to let you know that we do talk among staff on a regular basis.

01:36:57.272 --> 01:36:59.453
And we realize that the systems of support is now

01:37:00.333 --> 01:37:09.580
is now real and the dashboard release needs to be coordinated with how systems of support and the language around that gets out.

01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:16.865
So we are talking about a coordinated communications plan moving forward for this November release.

01:37:17.546 --> 01:37:22.629
The other piece I wanted to mention is that other organizations are stepping up to the plate and doing outreach.

01:37:22.809 --> 01:37:24.731
I think last meeting I mentioned to you that the

01:37:26.352 --> 01:37:40.528
that the CDE Foundation had some funding and has put together some parent resources and so this flyer is the first of those resources and I don't think it's yet publicly posted but we'll try to get it up on our website.

01:37:40.888 --> 01:37:45.792
because we are trying to build out our parent tab on the accountability website.

01:37:45.812 --> 01:37:54.618
But it is nice to see others who have different sets of expertise than us sometimes in communicating to the field to get information out.

01:37:55.158 --> 01:37:55.959
So with that, I

01:37:57.620 --> 01:38:02.003
I also wanted to let you know that we are, in addition to Michelle, going to numerous conferences this fall.

01:38:02.043 --> 01:38:08.708
We will be on the circuit talking about the dashboard and talking about the decisions that you're making today.

01:38:08.768 --> 01:38:14.152
Everybody is very eager in the field to learn about what November brings for them in the fall dashboard.

01:38:14.593 --> 01:38:17.855
So with that, President Christ, we have finished the presentation.

01:38:18.286 --> 01:38:18.646
Okay.

01:38:18.686 --> 01:38:19.967
Well, that's quite an update.

01:38:20.448 --> 01:38:25.271
So we're ready for board member questions or comments on these technical items.

01:38:25.331 --> 01:38:27.793
Perhaps our liaisons ought to start.

01:38:28.793 --> 01:38:30.995
Board member Strauss is one of them.

01:38:31.355 --> 01:38:34.777
Board member Burr is the other because you've heard this as well and been over.

01:38:35.218 --> 01:38:36.438
A lot of it's pretty technical.

01:38:37.199 --> 01:38:42.282
So I want to first comment on the college and career indicator as a former high school principal.

01:38:42.883 --> 01:38:43.843
I feel like the

01:38:44.984 --> 01:38:56.574
the components that make up the college and career indicator are really important to help inform high school staffs and community and how we work together to improve college and career readiness.

01:38:57.035 --> 01:39:01.399
And so I just want to compliment the data set that is available.

01:39:01.439 --> 01:39:10.206
We did present it at CPAG and also I've presented it at Santa Barbara and San Bernardino County superintendents and to a college career

01:39:11.307 --> 01:39:13.108
collaborating committee in Riverside.

01:39:13.468 --> 01:39:27.474
And people were particularly pleased with the different data sets that you are able, so that districts are going to be able to click and go deeper into the data and really see who's A to G ready and how you actually calculated it.

01:39:27.534 --> 01:39:34.257
So I think that that alone, it's a wonderful indicator, but it doesn't tell you everything unless you unpack it.

01:39:34.917 --> 01:39:36.659
to try to deal with the different components.

01:39:36.679 --> 01:39:39.202
So just a compliment on the ability.

01:39:39.582 --> 01:39:48.451
And I think as Member Bernier said when we met with staff is that it's not done yet, but it's definitely ready to get out there and to be used.

01:39:48.511 --> 01:39:51.053
So just a positive comment on that one.

01:39:51.073 --> 01:39:52.835
And then also on the small schools,

01:39:53.275 --> 01:39:56.196
since more than half of our districts are really small.

01:39:56.436 --> 01:40:02.318
And as I talked to superintendents, they wanted us to remember and not to forget the smalls.

01:40:02.398 --> 01:40:07.400
And so I think they're particularly appreciative of the safety net calculation.

01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:12.682
And at least as I presented just in the last week to them.

01:40:12.802 --> 01:40:22.345
So again, I think those are in trying to improve our overall dashboard and our indicators, making them reliable, I think is actually really, really important.

01:40:22.985 --> 01:40:42.081
And then to support the English learner progress indicator and the additional, because we're asking districts to really focus on English learners and to help students get reclassified and support them, the fact that we're rewarding and reinforcing students that make the progress, I think that's an important support as well.

01:40:42.141 --> 01:40:46.885
So those are some general comments that may have some more after that, but maybe Member Burr would like to add.

01:40:48.517 --> 01:40:48.917
Thank you.

01:40:48.977 --> 01:40:55.601
Yeah, I would just echo what board member Strauss said and also just to say this is what continuous learning looks like, right?

01:40:55.761 --> 01:41:08.088
We made this commitment that we would be reviewing this carefully and I just really want to commend Cindy and Jenny and Michelle and everybody who's involved in this that they're very good listeners.

01:41:08.188 --> 01:41:15.772
They hear what people are telling them about issues that are important and while this seems very technical and some of it is very technical,

01:41:16.312 --> 01:41:29.050
It's a reflection of them being very good listeners and understanding that if we want to make this work and we want people to feel that it's transparent and that it's actually measuring what it's supposed to be measuring, we have to have this level of attention.

01:41:29.110 --> 01:41:31.233
So I really, really appreciate that.

01:41:32.033 --> 01:41:40.358
Also, just to reinforce what Board Member Strauss said about small schools, that's going to be especially important as we talk about the next item.

01:41:40.639 --> 01:41:49.864
Because when we start talking about systems of support, the level of support that small LEAs need is very different than what Los Angeles Unified needs.

01:41:50.445 --> 01:41:56.809
And I know there's this tendency that people want us to standardize and say everybody should do A, B, C.

01:41:57.489 --> 01:41:59.350
It just doesn't work in every setting.

01:41:59.850 --> 01:42:08.113
So this is actually a very good indication of why it doesn't, that when you pull apart the data, it just doesn't work with small populations.

01:42:08.213 --> 01:42:15.116
So anyway, I want to have an opportunity to hear from people about our stakeholders' input.

01:42:15.156 --> 01:42:16.757
But again, thank you very much.

01:42:16.857 --> 01:42:18.658
I really appreciate all the work you've done.

01:42:20.179 --> 01:42:21.340
And I had one more thing to add.

01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:32.648
So as I present the College and Career Indicator out to stakeholders in the field in those three counties that I talked about, I made it really clear that we still have some work ahead of us on the College and Career Indicator.

01:42:32.668 --> 01:42:36.311
So I appreciated the ones that you're still working on.

01:42:36.371 --> 01:42:41.294
I also believe high school readiness is an indicator that you're talking about as well.

01:42:41.695 --> 01:42:47.739
And also the field really is concerned that we have not, they accept that we haven't finished at the highly prepared area yet.

01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:52.642
But I've assured them that that is an area that we still are evaluating.

01:42:52.702 --> 01:43:03.148
And also that in looking at what career tech course taking patterns are, apparently there's some issues on standardization of what inputs people put into the CALPADS.

01:43:03.549 --> 01:43:08.131
So I assured them that we are aware of that and that we are going.

01:43:08.191 --> 01:43:12.154
So I think when we get done summarizing before after the comments,

01:43:12.874 --> 01:43:30.019
to clarify the continued work we have to do since we haven't resolved all the career technical preparation as whether it's several courses on a capstone project, where the certifications are going to be, where do internships fit in, and that we feel like it's ready for the first round to

01:43:31.019 --> 01:43:38.345
to practice and work with, but we know it's not complete yet and that we want to deal with the highly prepared and complete some of those.

01:43:38.905 --> 01:43:45.330
So maybe at the end, we might summarize still some of the tasks that you're clear about that we still need to do.

01:43:45.610 --> 01:43:45.851
Thanks.

01:43:47.352 --> 01:43:48.813
Okay, Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:51.591
Thank you for the presentation.

01:43:52.312 --> 01:44:03.103
Yes, I also want to echo on some of the concerns that I read from some of the letters that came in in regards to the college career readiness indicator and in particular when we will have a well-prepared level.

01:44:03.564 --> 01:44:07.608
So we offer a three-year plan, but we never really commit to a timeline for it.

01:44:07.948 --> 01:44:12.292
So I think it is important for us to say by, you know, certain year we will have it in place.

01:44:13.994 --> 01:44:26.918
The other thing that I've said it a couple of times before, the participation rate, I see that now we're moving into a local indicator for access to course study, broad course study.

01:44:27.678 --> 01:44:32.940
So I want to ask about... Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:33.740
Be patient.

01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:44.288
I want to ask about the local indicators because my concern is I think it's such, for me, who is having access, what student groups have access is critical.

01:44:44.489 --> 01:44:54.097
And if we move it from this indicator and we put it at the local level and we haven't really, I don't know how many people have actually submitted data, how many LEAs on the local indicators.

01:44:54.777 --> 01:45:00.662
And I do believe that we need to add some rigor to them if I, you know, met, not met.

01:45:01.483 --> 01:45:07.886
For me, that doesn't tell me enough as somebody who's a parent and somebody who's a policymaker and somebody that's an educator that cares.

01:45:08.387 --> 01:45:10.127
So, that is my concern.

01:45:10.227 --> 01:45:11.408
Met, not met, for who?

01:45:11.868 --> 01:45:12.489
Who met it?

01:45:12.609 --> 01:45:13.449
Who had access?

01:45:13.829 --> 01:45:13.989
Right?

01:45:14.009 --> 01:45:16.211
So, it would leave a lot of questions for me.

01:45:16.831 --> 01:45:22.494
I do believe that we need to, for the sake of equity, really track that carefully and put it in a robust indicator.

01:45:23.794 --> 01:45:28.237
And the other thing is looking at additional measures like GPA was something that was mentioned.

01:45:28.837 --> 01:45:33.400
Are we moving more students to the prepared, nearly prepared, the different levels?

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:35.722
I'm sorry, I have a million notes in front of me.

01:45:36.682 --> 01:45:41.305
Also showing that removing students should be, there should be an incentive for that.

01:45:41.345 --> 01:45:43.947
And I heard that loud and clear from some of the letters and I agree.

01:45:44.407 --> 01:45:52.952
But if you could answer the question about local indicator and also GPA and some other measures and when we will have a well-prepared category.

01:45:54.653 --> 01:46:00.694
I can't answer the well-prepared category, but the local indicator, we're looking at just in draft form.

01:46:00.734 --> 01:46:05.435
So the met, not met is the standard of whether or not they have gone through the standard.

01:46:05.475 --> 01:46:10.816
And the standard has, they collected the data at the local level, discussed it, and then presented it to their local board.

01:46:11.236 --> 01:46:12.797
And that's the met, not met.

01:46:13.377 --> 01:46:19.618
The local indicator is really just very, very rough draft form and has room for development.

01:46:20.194 --> 01:46:33.461
The hope and the desire for the local indicators is really to serve as a catalyst at the local level to discuss those needs as they are unique to those areas and to dive those out.

01:46:36.186 --> 01:46:43.115
The met not met is the decision that the board made and that would be for you to change and to look at.

01:46:44.376 --> 01:46:52.627
But the draft, like I said, we'll bring a draft to you in November and get your feedback and move from there as robust and rigorous as you folks would like it to be.

01:46:54.110 --> 01:46:57.193
with people submitting information on the local indicators, LEAs.

01:46:57.393 --> 01:47:10.283
So, fall, I mean, in the spring it has been voluntarily and I don't have, the last number I saw was about 150 LEAs and we have been pushed out and I don't know if anybody has updated numbers, but that was the last I heard.

01:47:11.664 --> 01:47:12.105
Excuse me.

01:47:12.945 --> 01:47:17.409
I'm pushing it out though then and those again were field tests and be able to move forward and they would

01:47:18.041 --> 01:47:19.763
be permanent and fall, so we're pushing that out.

01:47:19.783 --> 01:47:28.675
In fact, we're writing just an update now to get it out to the field just to remind them it's time and encouraging them to do so.

01:47:30.357 --> 01:47:32.760
I think the other staff, you have other questions.

01:47:33.761 --> 01:47:36.464
Jeff can't answer all of the questions you raised.

01:47:41.925 --> 01:47:43.789
Jeff is heading up the local indicators.

01:47:43.869 --> 01:47:50.480
And since my office deals with statewide data, we are focused on the statewide indicators.

01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:54.607
So I appreciate my colleague coming up to help me.

01:47:56.769 --> 01:47:59.471
The college and career indicator, you had some questions on.

01:47:59.751 --> 01:47:59.971
Yes.

01:48:00.132 --> 01:48:08.657
Our timeline for well-prepared and also consideration of including the GPA, which I know in the past people have argued it's not really calibrated across the state.

01:48:09.357 --> 01:48:13.700
But we do have the data and, you know, to an extent, people will use it.

01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:16.722
I mean, it may not be calibrated, but that's how students are getting into college.

01:48:17.202 --> 01:48:17.363
So.

01:48:18.543 --> 01:48:20.065
I'll take the latter one first.

01:48:20.345 --> 01:48:29.412
It's not currently in our three-year plan because it's not data that is, as you say, there is a wide range of how LEAs report this.

01:48:29.532 --> 01:48:35.877
So it's something that we would have to actually create a standardization for in order for it to be valid and reliable at the state level.

01:48:35.998 --> 01:48:37.299
And that, I think, will take time.

01:48:37.919 --> 01:48:38.439
bit of time.

01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:42.462
I cannot commit to you on when we'll get a well-prepared piece either.

01:48:42.842 --> 01:48:57.192
We do have a three-year plan in place and as measures get added to the CCI and we develop out existing courses in CALPADS to support that, we need to train our CALPADS staff to get those

01:48:57.792 --> 01:48:58.232
data right.

01:48:58.252 --> 01:49:07.497
And so I think that Member Strauss was mentioning the fact that our CALPADS district leads are getting trained right now on inputting data.

01:49:07.657 --> 01:49:12.760
We still have concerns with data quality and you're going to hear a lot about that when I come back in November with our

01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:15.661
with our chronic absenteeism indicator.

01:49:15.781 --> 01:49:21.364
In fact, we didn't have 100% of district submit information to us for that particular data set.

01:49:21.444 --> 01:49:30.129
So I have concerns as well that I don't have 100% of our LEAs submitting data to us on something that is very important, which you've all deemed as very important.

01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:31.949
You've put it as an indicator in our system.

01:49:32.490 --> 01:49:42.535
So I think we have a ways to go, but as far as committing to a time, I wanna be in a more comfortable place in the data quality before I bring you a firm date that I can commit to.

01:49:44.932 --> 01:49:46.013
Okay, Board Member Rucker.

01:49:48.574 --> 01:49:57.879
Okay, so I want to begin also by adding my kudos and congratulations to not only the amount of work that's been done, but what's actually been accomplished.

01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:10.386
I have to tell you quite frankly, three years ago when we started down this road on not only implementing the LCAP and figuring out those regs and writing the template, I really was lost.

01:50:11.707 --> 01:50:16.789
in what the process was going to look like to develop this accountability system.

01:50:17.369 --> 01:50:32.436
And despite the fact a lot of work has been done to create a system that truly does have, meet the multiple in multiple measures, so that it's not multiple assessments, but multiple types of indicators.

01:50:33.176 --> 01:50:39.879
I remain sensitive to the criticism that this accountability system as being implemented

01:50:40.479 --> 01:50:41.860
is still loosey-goosey.

01:50:42.581 --> 01:51:10.042
And so part of this loosey-gooseyness is related to the fact that for accountability purposes and the purposes of identifying schools that are subject to intervention or that could be identified as among the lowest performing schools, we have multiple indicators that over multiple different types of timelines are in various stages of being fully developed and fully implemented.

01:51:10.666 --> 01:51:15.328
but the clock for identifying these schools has started ticking.

01:51:16.028 --> 01:51:37.115
And so I do have that particular concern and I want to understand, for example, when the data elements for the dashboard are rolled out in November, how will schools understand what their status looks like based on the fact that some of the elements in the data dashboard

01:51:37.615 --> 01:51:48.366
are not fully fleshed out, but will in some way contribute to informing the state's decision on what the status of those schools are.

01:51:48.386 --> 01:51:54.712
And that's a question we're going to have to live with right now, and we may know more about that

01:51:55.112 --> 01:51:57.953
when we come back for the board meeting in November.

01:51:57.993 --> 01:52:05.774
So, that's not a question you have to ask to answer today, but I want to put that out there because that's a concern that I have.

01:52:06.394 --> 01:52:12.415
The second concern that I have is related to some other work that's going on right now.

01:52:13.035 --> 01:52:22.897
Along with two other members on this board, I was appointed by Dr. Kirst to be part of the California Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory Committee.

01:52:24.298 --> 01:52:47.838
during our last meeting, we took a look at the student data systems from several statewide agencies, the UCs, the CSUs, the community colleges, and they actually have existing data about workforce preparation, but also about student course taking that actually could inform some of our indicators.

01:52:48.298 --> 01:52:52.382
And so one of the questions I asked at the end of that particular meeting

01:52:53.042 --> 01:53:09.406
is not only why is their data system better, but how come we can't use that information since our criteria for the data points that we're supposed to use to build out our indicator is existing databases.

01:53:09.786 --> 01:53:22.209
So there are some existing data systems from the community colleges, from the CSUs, from the UCs that tell us more about the courses our students are taking, about the access

01:53:22.529 --> 01:53:33.792
to a broad course of study, particularly that our seniors have received as part of the work that these systems are doing to receive these students matriculating into their program.

01:53:34.112 --> 01:53:39.834
They know more about those schools than our current data system has the capacity to report.

01:53:40.294 --> 01:53:50.627
So, again, that's not a question you have to answer today, but I did propose this question and there were staff who were in this room today that I gave that question to.

01:53:50.647 --> 01:53:57.516
I would like to know, as part of this plan for building out over the next three years, the college and career indicator,

01:53:57.995 --> 01:54:10.159
and developing the information that we have to collect on student course taking as it relates to CTE courses, there are other data systems that have that information.

01:54:10.540 --> 01:54:19.783
And I want to make sure that we're taking advantage of the type of information and data analysis that those other systems have used.

01:54:19.803 --> 01:54:22.464
So that's the second question you don't have to answer.

01:54:22.944 --> 01:54:26.565
Now, the third question that you don't have to answer today.

01:54:26.705 --> 01:54:44.228
Perhaps, just on the second question, because the last meeting, I think you probed me on this too, and the McCall-Kerlander study with the CDE, she has data from CSU, she has data from the community colleges and that five-year grant from IES, from the federal government will help us get there.

01:54:44.308 --> 01:54:46.868
That is the exact intent of that grant.

01:54:46.928 --> 01:54:51.369
So, we just had a conversation with her earlier this week about getting data from EDD and

01:54:51.970 --> 01:54:53.199
um while we're

01:54:53.991 --> 01:54:54.791
We're not there yet.

01:54:56.292 --> 01:55:01.095
That is one of our vehicles for getting at that question that you keep probing us on.

01:55:01.595 --> 01:55:03.516
And she's being sweet.

01:55:03.536 --> 01:55:06.638
What she's really trying to tell you is I've been a bit of a nag.

01:55:07.278 --> 01:55:13.261
So the last question I would like to have an answer to and it concerns the student score report.

01:55:13.701 --> 01:55:21.445
With each successive assessment cycle and with as we've done more work now on developing and preparing

01:55:22.806 --> 01:55:37.090
the dashboard to send out to the public, some of the information that's on our student score report is no longer at sync with the kind of information that parents can now see when they look at the dashboard.

01:55:37.510 --> 01:55:45.132
And I realize that the geography on the two pages we actually have on the student score report is, you know,

01:55:45.772 --> 01:55:52.880
a bone of contention, more serious than figuring out where state boundaries and borders are actually going to be.

01:55:53.400 --> 01:56:03.511
But I would suggest, particularly as it relates to the college readiness indicator or as it relates to for students who have career technical education,

01:56:04.772 --> 01:56:08.735
information that's going, that they've taken courses on.

01:56:09.196 --> 01:56:19.185
There may need to be some consideration on what to say about what the indicator is saying or because since Smarter Balanced does do with grade 11,

01:56:20.106 --> 01:56:39.197
a score, a report about the student's readiness and we're continuing to make adjustments on what that definition is that maybe we, there needs to be a plan for looking at whether or not, is there a plan or have you thought that we might need to update or do something to revise the score report.

01:56:40.319 --> 01:56:42.641
Maybe I can take it from the accountability piece first.

01:56:43.242 --> 01:56:47.926
The college career indicator is meant to be a school and LA level indicator.

01:56:48.486 --> 01:56:53.371
At no point have we looked at it being a student level measurement.

01:56:53.411 --> 01:56:56.113
And so I think that's something that is very different.

01:56:56.174 --> 01:57:01.799
But I will turn it over to Michelle since she is in charge of the real estate section of that two page report you talk about.

01:57:02.399 --> 01:57:04.800
So you are correct.

01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:10.744
We have been plagued with this problem of real estate on our student reports for many years.

01:57:11.384 --> 01:57:21.209
And so while I'm not prepared to talk about it today, in January, I will be coming back to this board and we will be having a conversation that addresses that particular problem.

01:57:21.489 --> 01:57:22.450
I knew that's what you were going to say.

01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:23.790
That's why I wanted to ask that question.

01:57:23.890 --> 01:57:25.071
Thank you.

01:57:25.131 --> 01:57:26.432
Board member Sun.

01:57:27.793 --> 01:57:28.214
Thank you.

01:57:28.374 --> 01:57:29.636
I think this is going to be for Jenny.

01:57:30.238 --> 01:57:31.600
I'm all about the small schools.

01:57:31.941 --> 01:57:37.010
So I just had a little bit of some technical questions regarding the three by five.

01:57:37.611 --> 01:57:37.872
Okay.

01:57:39.235 --> 01:57:40.716
So first of all, thank you so much.

01:57:40.756 --> 01:57:45.940
I know I've been a broken record with regards to this small schools, small LEAs.

01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:53.825
And so I appreciate the work that the TDG and your staff are doing to make sure that we don't get that volatility.

01:57:54.286 --> 01:57:59.389
So but just on the technical end, when it shrinks to three by five, is it a

01:58:00.710 --> 01:58:02.611
Is the scale shrinking?

01:58:02.631 --> 01:58:08.174
I just I'm kind of curious how technically it works or you're just taking the two ends out?

01:58:08.775 --> 01:58:23.983
We're just we're just taking the two ends out for change only And that's where the volatility comes in because if you look at the suspension for elementaries a 1% change in suspension I believe it's 1% is is

01:58:26.564 --> 01:58:30.827
So if you increase suspension rate by 1%, that is the increased...

01:58:38.993 --> 01:58:40.854
Suspension always messes me up.

01:58:42.274 --> 01:58:48.796
So if you have a small school for the suspension and it's a 1% change, you could actually go from a green to an orange.

01:58:49.196 --> 01:58:54.597
Because if you only have 100 students, that 1% could be one student.

01:58:54.637 --> 01:58:58.138
So one student is really making a large swing from a green to an orange.

01:58:58.558 --> 01:59:04.400
So when we eliminate the two ends, then we're reducing that significant swing.

01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:12.302
So one student can't force a school from a green to an orange or a green to a yellow.

01:59:15.283 --> 01:59:16.263
Okay.

01:59:16.664 --> 01:59:23.546
And so I appreciate as we get more data, we'll continue looking at this system and seeing how that works.

01:59:24.026 --> 01:59:28.507
I am surprised that it didn't impact student groups or individual student groups.

01:59:28.587 --> 01:59:30.688
That just seems a little bit counterintuitive.

01:59:31.650 --> 01:59:36.114
It is counterintuitive, but that's what the data showed us.

01:59:36.735 --> 01:59:40.318
And as I mentioned, we wanted to be very cautious with moving forward with this.

01:59:40.358 --> 01:59:42.500
We didn't have as much time.

01:59:42.881 --> 01:59:45.123
We don't have multiple years of data to look at.

01:59:45.583 --> 01:59:53.731
So we wanted to be cautious moving forward with this is when we get more data in, it may change and we'll come back and address it when it does.

01:59:54.031 --> 01:59:54.171
Right.

01:59:54.291 --> 02:00:00.837
And I'm just looking for a commitment that will continue, of course, refining this as well as other indicators and as we get more and more data in.

02:00:03.339 --> 02:00:05.902
I think, I think that was all I have for it.

02:00:06.062 --> 02:00:06.242
Thanks.

02:00:11.034 --> 02:00:18.337
First of all, I just want to say thank you so much to the work that has been done by everyone in the work group, but also the TDG and really doing the analysis.

02:00:19.138 --> 02:00:22.919
So I think this is really not just about the numbers, it's about the story that the numbers tell.

02:00:22.979 --> 02:00:27.341
And so as LEAs and schools begin to look at all of this work.

02:00:27.661 --> 02:00:31.583
So my question has to do with the broad course of study actually with Jeff.

02:00:32.123 --> 02:00:41.493
And so I know that statutorily they just have to go through the process at the local level and indicate whether or not they've done the process and that's met or not met.

02:00:41.953 --> 02:00:46.979
Is there any, are there any plans to look at what people are beginning to post?

02:00:47.659 --> 02:00:54.486
I know it was a pilot in the spring, but those kinds of descriptions that are going into there, because I think LEAs would like

02:00:55.347 --> 02:01:09.047
to see qualitatively are there suggestions instead of you know going shopping to see well what did another district put in or what is I think more direction would be helpful to LEAs just to see or sampling so that it's not sort of

02:01:10.629 --> 02:01:15.171
just dependent upon the LEA's talent or luck of what they put in, I think it would be helpful.

02:01:15.291 --> 02:01:16.912
So it's about transparency.

02:01:17.333 --> 02:01:27.698
Is there any opportunity for feedback to LEAs or is that just something that gets posted out on the World Wide Web and it's up to the local consumers or parents to give feedback?

02:01:27.938 --> 02:01:34.522
Currently on the local indicators, I believe it is what they post in the dashboard and what they show there.

02:01:35.483 --> 02:01:47.290
Any direction or any assistance that we can provide moving forward, we're certainly receptive to looking at that and what needs LEAs would need and request to provide that.

02:01:47.491 --> 02:01:50.613
So maybe some kind of sampling in the future might be helpful to LEAs.

02:01:50.673 --> 02:01:51.553
Just a suggestion.

02:01:51.893 --> 02:01:52.174
Thanks.

02:01:54.275 --> 02:01:55.576
Board member Holliday.

02:01:57.082 --> 02:02:07.750
To follow up on Member Sung's comments about the small schools, first of all, thank you very, very much for all the people, all of you who did so much work to analyze this and to make this recommendation.

02:02:07.770 --> 02:02:21.281
I want to make sure everyone understands that what this will do is not change the data, will not change the facts, will not change the reality, but instead simply reduce the hyperbole.

02:02:21.861 --> 02:02:34.245
And the fact is that it in many ways will actually help a small school understand more realistically what happened in the previous year, what the change has been.

02:02:34.725 --> 02:02:39.587
It is not concealing the fact that suspension rates went up or down.

02:02:40.107 --> 02:02:43.188
It's reducing the hyperbole and that's a good thing.

02:02:46.469 --> 02:02:47.249
Board Member Sandoval.

02:02:50.168 --> 02:02:55.173
I have a question and just some clarification on the California alternate assessment recommendation.

02:02:55.193 --> 02:03:01.459
And I understand it's not ready yet for inclusion for accountability purposes.

02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:06.284
But I do know that we are committed to being accountable for each and every student.

02:03:07.686 --> 02:03:13.511
And so the recommendation is to report out the results of the status.

02:03:15.052 --> 02:03:24.001
But we still need more time to evaluate options and run simulations about how to incorporate that into the full accountability system.

02:03:24.021 --> 02:03:29.606
So if you could just describe a little bit about the plan in the next year to get to that place.

02:03:30.226 --> 02:03:30.467
Sure.

02:03:30.807 --> 02:03:44.923
So I think what we are proposing is that similar to the grade 11 results that you asked us to put as a separate data point on the dashboard, we would do that for the California Alternate Assessment so that, again,

02:03:46.485 --> 02:03:54.815
parents that have students that participate in it are seeing their students' progress as part of their overall school's progress.

02:03:55.195 --> 02:04:04.106
But in terms of what lies ahead of us, not only will our technical design group be looking at this, I'm sure we'll be working with Michelle's

02:04:05.767 --> 02:04:10.568
technical group as well on the assessment side and again our testing contractor to make sure that we do this right.

02:04:10.908 --> 02:04:12.369
We want to be very thoughtful about this.

02:04:12.709 --> 02:04:17.210
We don't want to force something to occur that may not be valid and reliable.

02:04:18.070 --> 02:04:31.114
So, you know, as the test has yet another year of operation and we can look at how we can merge those results into something that we do in accountability, which is look at status and then change.

02:04:31.134 --> 02:04:32.394
We look at year-over-year change.

02:04:32.774 --> 02:04:35.136
We want to make sure that we do this correctly.

02:04:35.256 --> 02:04:46.024
So over the next year, we'll take yet another look at that data and we'll engage with those technical groups to make sure that, to see if we can do this for next year.

02:04:46.874 --> 02:05:04.704
And I think engaging the Advisory Commission on Special Education to the degree possible is very valuable because they meet frequently, have the depth of expertise, and I know we're very committed to seeing the evolution into one system that serves all of our students.

02:05:04.724 --> 02:05:07.025
So thank you for, again, for being a great listener.

02:05:07.465 --> 02:05:10.747
The entire team, everyone who's working on it, I'm very grateful.

02:05:11.015 --> 02:05:11.335
Thank you.

02:05:11.696 --> 02:05:11.956
Thank you.

02:05:11.976 --> 02:05:16.361
And I know Michelle's presented to them several times, and I think we've been at every meeting since last year.

02:05:16.461 --> 02:05:19.945
So we are now a standing item on the commission's agenda.

02:05:19.965 --> 02:05:22.488
So I appreciate that feedback.

02:05:23.730 --> 02:05:24.871
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

02:05:26.728 --> 02:05:34.752
I have a question on the small schools and I thank you for clarifying that the 2,800 was a SPAM school because when I read the item, I reacted.

02:05:34.772 --> 02:05:42.576
I'm like, are we really allowing people to capture to get the safety net if they had mass dropouts with the 2,800 high school?

02:05:42.976 --> 02:05:49.580
So thank you for making that and I hope it's very clear that that has to be the denominator so that, you know, it's not confused.

02:05:50.180 --> 02:06:02.766
There was a couple of folks that raised the, that suggested that we also do something similar for LEAs looking at not only the school site level, but considering something similar for LEAs.

02:06:02.806 --> 02:06:05.187
And I'm wondering if there has been any discussions about that.

02:06:05.987 --> 02:06:12.650
Yes, the small and size would apply to schools and LEAs because we do have single school districts out there.

02:06:12.690 --> 02:06:14.711
So it would be applied to LEAs too.

02:06:15.432 --> 02:06:18.373
And charter schools, of course, who are considered LEAs under the system.

02:06:22.029 --> 02:06:22.850
Thank you.

02:06:23.210 --> 02:06:24.111
Thank you, President Cruz.

02:06:24.271 --> 02:06:31.719
Just wanted to add on a quick supplement to Mr. Brashear's response to the questions around local indicators from board member Ortiz-Licona, board member Valdez.

02:06:31.779 --> 02:06:44.652
And just to recap the earlier piece of Mr. Brashear's presentation where the school conditions and climate work group, which has been working really hard on priority six, will be putting out an information memorandum in October.

02:06:45.072 --> 02:07:00.844
and then hoping to come back to the board in November with some very extensive recommendations around priority six, both related to measurement, but also fundamentally the work group has been grappling with the concept of support, which links into our next item or item three around system of support.

02:07:02.102 --> 02:07:21.367
And the superintendent has also begun to convene in relation to priority three, parental involvement and ad hoc work groups as we move and not wind down, but as we complete the work of the school conditions and climate work group, we're hoping to then move into priority three and do the same kind of intensive look and bring back to you some recommendations.

02:07:23.128 --> 02:07:23.408
Okay.

02:07:23.468 --> 02:07:25.549
I think that concludes the board questions.

02:07:25.569 --> 02:07:27.889
So before public comment, I think we need a break.

02:07:27.969 --> 02:07:29.930
So let's come back at 10 of 11.

02:07:39.099 --> 02:07:41.200
Okay, the State Board will reconvene.

02:07:47.402 --> 02:07:52.364
We're ready for public comment on item two.

02:07:56.286 --> 02:07:57.026
Amy, please.

02:07:57.946 --> 02:07:58.867
Do we have the people?

02:07:58.887 --> 02:08:01.868
The following people are for public comment.

02:08:02.648 --> 02:08:06.650
Would the following speakers please line up for public comment.

02:08:09.073 --> 02:08:29.843
Celia Jaffe, Doug McCray, Mary Perry, Martha Diaz, Roberto Villamontes, Shelly Watley, Colin Miller, Martha Alvarez, Sheldon Smith, Liz Guillen, Brian Riveras, and Terry Burns.

02:08:46.957 --> 02:08:48.238
Parent Teacher Association.

02:08:49.419 --> 02:08:52.001
I want to talk about some of the local indicators.

02:08:52.041 --> 02:08:57.046
I want to appreciate the comments by members Ortiz, Lacone, Rucker, and Valdez about these.

02:08:58.267 --> 02:09:14.040
The broad course of study, access to a broad course of study, I'm happy that the board will be looking at this indicator and standards for it because the access to a complete education for all children is at the baseline of what we should be providing.

02:09:14.801 --> 02:09:32.214
We suggest that the board members look at the California Arts Education Data Project, which summarizes arts course offerings around the state using CALPADS data as sort of a model of what kinds of data collection is presently available using CALPADS.

02:09:33.561 --> 02:09:44.126
We also want to appreciate the work of the School Conditions and Climate Work Group, which we participated in as members and in the stakeholder feedback session.

02:09:45.326 --> 02:09:47.828
But dearest to our heart, parent and family engagement.

02:09:49.989 --> 02:09:54.471
We're hoping to get standards and definition of that in statute soon.

02:09:54.691 --> 02:09:54.951
Thank you.

02:09:58.769 --> 02:10:01.571
Good morning, Terry Burns, California School Boards Association.

02:10:01.611 --> 02:10:06.635
We particularly want to thank the work for the work on the small schools indicator.

02:10:06.655 --> 02:10:09.377
We think that that is incredibly valuable and important.

02:10:09.817 --> 02:10:10.718
We're pleased with that.

02:10:11.198 --> 02:10:18.323
We look forward to your action to have chronic absence in this year's the fall dashboard.

02:10:18.343 --> 02:10:20.024
We think that's very important as well.

02:10:20.885 --> 02:10:28.768
Finally, on the local indicators, we have concern that school climate work group is talking about having district survey every year.

02:10:28.848 --> 02:10:32.069
We think that is to mandate that is too often.

02:10:32.669 --> 02:10:40.072
It's costly, it's timely, and it doesn't give us time to actually implement the changes that we see as a result of those surveys.

02:10:40.632 --> 02:10:40.932
Thank you.

02:10:47.295 --> 02:10:50.336
Good morning, Mary Perry, California State PTA.

02:10:51.097 --> 02:10:55.959
And I really want to focus on the dashboard as it applies to high school accountability.

02:10:56.519 --> 02:11:06.603
The California State PTA still sees that reporting incomplete as long as there isn't a separate indicator around SBAC scores for 11th graders.

02:11:07.123 --> 02:11:13.086
And we hope that in the spirit of continuous improvement and exploration, that that remains on the agenda.

02:11:13.946 --> 02:11:27.694
As far as the CCI components, college and career is a higher benchmark than college or career and needs to be part of the consideration for how that well-prepared category is defined.

02:11:28.255 --> 02:11:33.058
And we have confidence that that continues to be a consideration.

02:11:33.518 --> 02:11:39.562
In addition, I see military participation as a possible inclusion in the CCI

02:11:40.262 --> 02:11:51.469
We have the National Student Clearinghouse data, which would be a cost to the state, but is another way to get post-secondary information about our students and really needs to be considered as well.

02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:52.029
Thank you.

02:11:57.543 --> 02:12:00.245
Good morning, Colin Miller with the California Charter Schools Association.

02:12:00.545 --> 02:12:03.487
I just want to make a couple comments on the CCI indicator.

02:12:04.007 --> 02:12:13.953
We've done some preliminary runs of the data based on the 13-14 data that's available, and we see a significant over-representation of charter schools in the red on that.

02:12:14.073 --> 02:12:15.254
It's very severe.

02:12:16.134 --> 02:12:20.117
And we know that the item didn't really give you that kind of information.

02:12:20.157 --> 02:12:25.442
We're concerned that you're being asked to vote on cut scores when you haven't seen those kind of breakdown in the data.

02:12:25.982 --> 02:12:35.930
And we would definitely encourage you to request that the design group and CD go back and look at this, run this data so we can really see what's behind it.

02:12:36.990 --> 02:12:42.335
It's hard to know what's behind it because we don't have all the data, but we have some ideas about why that's why

02:12:43.015 --> 02:12:49.057
charters are being so significantly overrepresented and we could get into those conversations, but we did want to alert you to this.

02:12:49.578 --> 02:13:02.843
We're really concerned that the dashboards will come out without the backup data on this information, particularly around the four-year cohort grad rate data being used instead of just all grads.

02:13:02.943 --> 02:13:10.566
There's a number of issues, so we could go into it, but very concerned about the data being released with this huge overrepresentation.

02:13:10.726 --> 02:13:10.946
Thank you.

02:13:16.001 --> 02:13:16.501
Good morning.

02:13:16.581 --> 02:13:19.403
Sheila Whitley representing California Teachers Association.

02:13:19.943 --> 02:13:30.268
CTA represents appreciates the board and department's ongoing efforts to design and implement a truly integrated statewide system of accountability and support.

02:13:31.368 --> 02:13:39.512
We recommend authentic engagement with stakeholders in advance of your November meeting around the issues of chronic absenteeism.

02:13:40.912 --> 02:13:42.753
Secondly we're also concerned that

02:13:44.654 --> 02:13:49.961
The local indicators are being neglected both at the state levels and in local implementation.

02:13:50.541 --> 02:14:03.617
The holistic and multidimensional promise of LCFF and LCAP accountability system is largely built on these indicators, but they remain essentially unchanged despite assurances that they were interim measures.

02:14:04.258 --> 02:14:14.865
Therefore, we urge the board to direct staff to develop options beyond the not met for two years provision that would incentivize LEAs to meaningfully implement the local indicators.

02:14:15.166 --> 02:14:15.486
Thank you.

02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:22.021
Good morning.

02:14:22.061 --> 02:14:27.524
I'm Doug McRae, a retired educational testing measurement specialist from Monterey.

02:14:28.025 --> 02:14:36.391
The recommendations for the five technical revisions for the fall dashboard that were just discussed are all okay as far as I can see.

02:14:37.952 --> 02:14:41.775
I submitted brief notes on these five revisions to your electronic folder last week.

02:14:42.595 --> 02:14:54.185
My general comment is that California's new accountability system is still in an early stage of development, that multiple measures framework is okay, but it suffers from lack of maturity for many of the indicators that feed into that framework.

02:14:54.706 --> 02:14:59.850
I was pleased to hear concerns from the accountability staff this morning on the quality of the data in many cases.

02:15:00.531 --> 02:15:08.918
It's likely to be 2020 before California has a robust statewide accountability system due to the quality of the currently available indicator data.

02:15:09.739 --> 02:15:10.019
Thank you.

02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:18.341
Good morning, Roberto Vida Montes with the Learning Policy Institute.

02:15:18.881 --> 02:15:21.762
I would like to offer the following comments on some of these indicators.

02:15:21.982 --> 02:15:31.565
With the English Learner Progress Indicator, LPI supports the revision to the indicator formula to include long-term English learners by providing extra credit for LTELs that advance at least one level on the CELT.

02:15:31.885 --> 02:15:38.488
We believe that it's appropriate for our accountability system to focus on helping LTELs make meaningful progress towards English proficiency.

02:15:39.028 --> 02:15:41.889
With the College and Career Indicator, we applaud the adoption of the CCI

02:15:42.609 --> 02:15:44.991
And we appreciate the three-year timeline for refining the CCI.

02:15:45.611 --> 02:15:49.394
We hope that this work will also include the addition of a well-prepared category.

02:15:50.295 --> 02:15:57.500
Given the importance of school climate and conditions to academic success, we support the use of high-quality climate surveys for students, staff, and parents.

02:15:58.540 --> 02:16:07.426
We recommend that California respect the use of local surveys that are valid and reliable, but that they cover some common constructs such as student safety, belonging, and social-emotional learning.

02:16:08.067 --> 02:16:13.931
Lastly, we support the continued development of additional local indicators, including broad courses of study and parent involvement.

02:16:14.551 --> 02:16:21.576
Measuring state priorities in these areas will strengthen school performance, offering rich curriculum and involving parents for both central aspects of schooling.

02:16:22.076 --> 02:16:24.438
And we hope with the parent involvement indicator,

02:16:25.598 --> 02:16:29.800
that it could be refined over time with the recommendations from the Family Engagement Working Group.

02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:30.940
Thank you.

02:16:35.801 --> 02:16:40.123
Good morning, Marta Alvarez on behalf of AXA, the Association of California School Administrators.

02:16:40.503 --> 02:16:41.883
I'll keep my comments high level.

02:16:42.143 --> 02:16:45.044
You received comments specifically to the different indicators on our letter.

02:16:45.824 --> 02:16:51.466
We want to be mindful and really appreciative of the work that CDE and SBE has undertaken on this evolving system.

02:16:52.166 --> 02:16:57.649
We just wanted to provide some comments regarding this system that will continue to evolve over the next several years.

02:16:58.509 --> 02:17:04.992
We are concerned that somehow there's a lot of changes being made and so we want to be mindful we have been asking for some of those changes.

02:17:05.332 --> 02:17:13.175
We appreciate you have been listening to the field but we're also now talking about adding you know the school climate indicator surveys on an annual basis potentially.

02:17:13.556 --> 02:17:16.997
We're talking about adding priority number seven on course access.

02:17:17.697 --> 02:17:21.219
So somehow finding that balance is really important so that the field really

02:17:22.039 --> 02:17:36.886
embraces the system of multiple measures, but how to ensure that we provide the adequate training that administrators need to understand the technical details, how they can read the data to be able to inform what they need to do at the local level, how it involves their LCAP process.

02:17:37.307 --> 02:17:49.953
And so we just really wanted to elevate those comments to the top because we want those administrators to be able to embrace this system, but too many changes at once may make them just wait for it, you know, three years from now.

02:17:50.333 --> 02:17:50.613
Thank you.

02:17:59.838 --> 02:18:00.238
Good morning.

02:18:00.278 --> 02:18:01.599
My name is Sheldon Smith.

02:18:01.739 --> 02:18:08.584
I'm the assistant superintendent, San Luis Obispo County Office of Education, as well as with the Association of California School Administrators.

02:18:08.604 --> 02:18:11.826
I appreciate the board's pursuit for improving the dashboard.

02:18:12.607 --> 02:18:19.911
My fear, and with apologies to Voltaire, that the pursuit of the perfect is the enemy of the good.

02:18:20.632 --> 02:18:29.678
I say this because the dashboard becomes more, as the dashboard becomes more complex, it makes it more difficult to convey those complexities to the field.

02:18:30.359 --> 02:18:35.344
Essentially, it's hard to explain dashboard details when the dashboard details change.

02:18:36.586 --> 02:18:49.761
I ask that for every change, please ensure that school administrators who work with the dashboard, that they have the user-friendly information to convey to parents, the community, to community members who support our kids.

02:18:50.542 --> 02:18:50.762
Thank you.

02:18:59.929 --> 02:19:01.810
President Kirst and members of the board.

02:19:01.851 --> 02:19:05.033
Brian Rivas speaking on behalf of the Education Trust West.

02:19:05.814 --> 02:19:09.136
We think the work on the indicators is coming along nicely.

02:19:09.156 --> 02:19:14.820
I have a couple of recommendations for you with regard to the college and career readiness indicator.

02:19:15.381 --> 02:19:17.402
We would agree with member Ortiz-Licon.

02:19:17.863 --> 02:19:29.472
It could be made even more valuable if we added a category of well-prepared so that we could capture data on who's ready for college and career as opposed to simply one or the other.

02:19:30.673 --> 02:19:48.653
We like the work on developing the local standards to measure access to a broad course of study and suggest that you take a look at making that indicator even stronger through the collection of quantitative data so we can see more precisely who's accessing particular types of coursework.

02:19:49.054 --> 02:19:49.314
Thank you.

02:19:53.697 --> 02:19:54.237
Good morning.

02:19:54.557 --> 02:19:56.238
Liz Guillen with Public Advocates.

02:19:57.278 --> 02:20:09.061
We appreciate very much the hard work that's been done to get us to this point and agree very much with Member Burr about and Member Rucker about just how incredible it is.

02:20:10.241 --> 02:20:21.564
We appreciate that the timeline now includes work on priority seven for broad course access and we would agree with Member Ortiz-Licón that it should be a robust indicator.

02:20:22.412 --> 02:20:26.114
beyond met, not met, and why can't we make it a state indicator?

02:20:27.455 --> 02:20:33.378
On the climate indicator, we look forward to that conversation in the next board meeting.

02:20:34.559 --> 02:20:36.240
We think that it needs to be strong.

02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:41.523
We need to make it clear that climate is a priority, just like the other state priorities.

02:20:42.283 --> 02:20:47.787
And the assessment of it needs to happen just like the other state priorities on an annual basis.

02:20:48.487 --> 02:21:06.529
For college and career indicator, we're disappointed that there's not plans to include attributes related to quality, some type of certification or oversight of the career pathway.

02:21:06.649 --> 02:21:07.070
Thank you.

02:21:12.563 --> 02:21:19.326
Martha Zaragoza-Diaz, and I'm representing the California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

02:21:19.346 --> 02:21:23.328
And my comment is specific on the long-term English learners.

02:21:23.908 --> 02:21:30.271
We support the inclusion of English language proficiency growth of LTELs in the ELPI.

02:21:31.932 --> 02:21:32.492
indicator.

02:21:33.432 --> 02:21:44.734
We believe that including this as a new metric will incentivize LEAs to address the language and academic needs of our long-term English learners.

02:21:45.214 --> 02:22:00.597
However, we would like to take it a step further and we would like to see this data in the dashboard as well in order to have LEAs to adequately address the needs of English learners by using that data.

02:22:00.937 --> 02:22:01.217
Thank you.

02:22:06.479 --> 02:22:09.281
Good morning, Shelly Spiegel-Coleman from Californians Together.

02:22:10.021 --> 02:22:17.686
We're really pleased the fact that we are going to start looking at priority seven, access to broad course of study and curriculum.

02:22:18.087 --> 02:22:27.973
Because when we talk about it as a course of study, a course, then we're only really, it ends up being a discussion about secondary, whether kids are getting into certain courses.

02:22:28.433 --> 02:22:32.196
And of course, a broad course of study begins in kindergarten.

02:22:32.856 --> 02:22:34.798
And we really need to look at indicators.

02:22:35.199 --> 02:22:37.761
You know, we're short on indicators for elementary.

02:22:37.801 --> 02:22:39.523
And so I think we really need to look at them.

02:22:39.643 --> 02:22:45.950
And in many respects, the curriculum at our elementary level over the last 12 to 15 years has become very narrow.

02:22:46.411 --> 02:22:49.134
And so this indicator could really send a message

02:22:49.574 --> 02:22:55.537
to our elementary schools about making sure that students get science, social science, art, a broad course of study.

02:22:56.077 --> 02:23:13.964
So looking at percentage of students that have a full day kindergarten, percentage of students by subgroup that really get this broad course of study over a week's period in a school, looking at what Brian said, some qualitative data in terms of meeting and not meeting, we think is really critical.

02:23:14.265 --> 02:23:15.005
Thank you so much.

02:23:20.204 --> 02:23:23.428
Good morning, LeAngela Reed on behalf of the Small School Districts Association.

02:23:23.448 --> 02:23:28.916
I want to thank the board for their attention to Smalls.

02:23:29.216 --> 02:23:33.942
If I named all of you who've made comments in support of Smalls, I wouldn't have any time left, but I want to thank you all.

02:23:35.263 --> 02:23:37.324
for doing so and keeping them at the forefront.

02:23:37.624 --> 02:23:42.106
The work with CDE with the small working group, working group of smalls has been tremendous.

02:23:42.246 --> 02:23:44.507
We do support the move to the three by five.

02:23:44.547 --> 02:23:48.749
We think that will address the flexibility, the volatility issues.

02:23:49.609 --> 02:23:57.572
We, some of our folks really were focused on the 250, but in conversations with CDE, we see 150 is the way to start.

02:23:57.932 --> 02:24:02.294
But we appreciate that they're going to keep this as an ongoing conversation as they have on a number of issues.

02:24:02.674 --> 02:24:07.819
With regard to the college and career readiness, we very much appreciate the work moving forward on that.

02:24:08.119 --> 02:24:18.067
And the comments of member Rucker relative to the joint task force ask that as we work with the community colleges, they look at those articulation agreements, which are faculty to faculty rather than institution to institution.

02:24:18.088 --> 02:24:20.610
I think we can have a lot more bridges if we address that.

02:24:21.270 --> 02:24:26.555
Save our comments for school time, but I want to just thank you again for the tremendous work in this moving forward.

02:24:28.595 --> 02:24:30.997
Okay, that concludes the public comments.

02:24:31.037 --> 02:24:32.938
So I think we're ready for a motion.

02:24:33.158 --> 02:24:34.740
Board member Strauss.

02:24:35.140 --> 02:24:40.104
So I would like to make a motion, including the following.

02:24:41.085 --> 02:24:56.897
For the ELPI, the LP, add a full count to the ELPI status numerator for each long-term English learner LTEL student who advances at least one level on the annual CELT test as detailed in Attachment 1.

02:24:57.597 --> 02:25:08.341
For the academic indicator, delay the incorporation of the alternative assessment in the academic indicator and direct CDE staff to report CAA data in the dashboard.

02:25:08.922 --> 02:25:18.745
For the college and career indicator, revise the cut scores for status based on the 2016-17 Smarter Balanced assessment results for grade 11 students.

02:25:20.166 --> 02:25:38.638
For small populations, apply the 3x5 grid at the indicator level based on the number of students included in each specific indicator rather than at a school level based on the number of students enrolled and support the recommendation for the end size of 150 due to statistical validity and reliability.

02:25:39.678 --> 02:25:45.722
And for the DASS, remove the Criterion 7, Emotionally Disturbed Students from Eligibility criteria.

02:25:48.573 --> 02:25:48.914
Second.

02:25:48.995 --> 02:25:50.399
Okay, it's been moved and seconded.

02:25:50.419 --> 02:25:50.900
Discussion.

02:25:50.940 --> 02:25:51.783
Board member Holliday.

02:25:52.997 --> 02:26:06.926
I do not have any of the data regarding what the representative from the California Charter Schools Association indicated that there seems to be an over-representation that doesn't seem logical.

02:26:08.006 --> 02:26:19.994
I would appreciate if the department could look into those data points and try to better understand if there is some anomaly there that needs to be corrected or whether or not that's not an issue.

02:26:21.001 --> 02:26:22.781
But I certainly support the motion.

02:26:24.122 --> 02:26:24.422
Go ahead.

02:26:24.622 --> 02:26:25.922
We can definitely bring back that data.

02:26:25.962 --> 02:26:29.223
We didn't have time to analyze it in the short period of time, but we can bring it back.

02:26:30.143 --> 02:26:36.685
And you had also indicated that you are still looking at the current year or fall 2017 data.

02:26:36.765 --> 02:26:41.046
I mean, sorry, spring 2017 testing data as well that you'll be incorporating.

02:26:41.106 --> 02:26:46.428
So it sounds like what the Charter Schools Association had some older data as well.

02:26:47.308 --> 02:26:52.472
The way I understood the Charter School Association comment was based on the 3x5 chart.

02:26:52.572 --> 02:26:54.693
Perhaps I was misunderstood.

02:26:54.733 --> 02:26:58.956
But if it's on the 3x5 chart, we're only looking at two indicators, suspension rate and graduation rate.

02:26:59.557 --> 02:27:02.078
For suspension rate, we are behind on our data.

02:27:02.439 --> 02:27:03.539
So we will be catching up.

02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:06.682
If you can just look into that.

02:27:06.882 --> 02:27:08.043
It was on the CCI.

02:27:08.063 --> 02:27:10.364
It was on the CCI.

02:27:10.504 --> 02:27:10.564
OK.

02:27:10.844 --> 02:27:12.986
We can look at all the indicators.

02:27:15.583 --> 02:27:15.683
Okay.

02:27:15.843 --> 02:27:17.284
Any further discussion by the board?

02:27:17.984 --> 02:27:18.164
Not.

02:27:18.224 --> 02:27:19.525
All those in favor, raise your hands.

02:27:19.545 --> 02:27:20.225
Okay.

02:27:20.245 --> 02:27:21.706
That looks to be unanimous.

02:27:22.646 --> 02:27:23.046
Okay.

02:27:23.886 --> 02:27:35.971
I want to remind board members to turn off your speakers when you're finished because it's causing problems with the audio feed for the people trying to watch us from a distance.

02:27:36.900 --> 02:27:42.444
So we're now on to item three, which is the system of state and local support.

02:27:43.224 --> 02:27:49.449
And we have several presentations on this and then we'll talk, deliberate on this as well.

02:27:50.469 --> 02:27:58.375
So I guess the Department of Education will lead off and introduce our guests as well.

02:28:06.189 --> 02:28:06.689
Good morning.

02:28:07.150 --> 02:28:08.390
I am so excited to be here.

02:28:08.650 --> 02:28:09.451
I'm Melanie Sheppey.

02:28:09.471 --> 02:28:13.993
I'm the director of the Improvement and Accountability Division at the California Department of Education.

02:28:14.013 --> 02:28:18.175
I heard, I already brought, all right, I was listening, Board Member Strauss.

02:28:18.235 --> 02:28:19.756
I'm bringing the energy.

02:28:19.856 --> 02:28:23.378
I'm really, I'm just excited to be in front of you and with my colleagues.

02:28:25.987 --> 02:28:37.432
Today I am joined by my colleagues from SSESA, El Dorado County Office of Education, Sacramento County Office of Education, Kern County Office of Education, CCEE and WestEd.

02:28:38.753 --> 02:28:47.196
We are here to provide the board an update on the statewide system of support and specifically thinking about the support that's already underway for the 2017-2018 school year.

02:28:49.707 --> 02:28:57.231
Thinking about the 2017-2018 school year, many of you know California's teachers and students have already started.

02:28:57.831 --> 02:29:01.433
And last time I was up here, I promised I would get in some of my Greenleaf Scholars.

02:29:01.693 --> 02:29:06.695
So the picture you see on the screen is a representation of the Greenleaf Scholars.

02:29:06.795 --> 02:29:10.377
They are already celebrating growth and progress, even though they've been in school for a month.

02:29:10.837 --> 02:29:13.478
As many of you know, the summer slide, every second counts.

02:29:15.279 --> 02:29:22.688
So I just wanted to orient us in the urgency that I know you all feel about making sure we're providing support for our districts and schools.

02:29:24.310 --> 02:29:34.061
And it's with this sense of urgency and requests from board members and the public that today we're going to focus on the support that is already underway for California's districts and schools.

02:29:35.865 --> 02:29:46.449
We'll begin with discussing the shifts in California's approach to improvement, what we've learned from previous school and district change efforts, and the stakeholder feedback that we've collected from district teams in August.

02:29:47.429 --> 02:29:55.893
Then we'll discuss the features of the California system of support, which you will hear mentioned and weaved throughout the specific presentations from my colleagues.

02:29:57.453 --> 02:30:04.556
We have further developed the larger framework for support, given your feedback and your discussion at the July State Board meeting.

02:30:05.683 --> 02:30:08.984
continued stakeholder feedback, and the collaboration through the cross-agency team.

02:30:09.404 --> 02:30:11.805
However, for today's presentation, that's not the focus.

02:30:12.025 --> 02:30:18.608
I wanted to make sure we brought together teams from across California to showcase and highlight the support that's already underway.

02:30:19.328 --> 02:30:22.489
I've worked very hard to make it a quick, seamless transition.

02:30:23.009 --> 02:30:24.970
And hopefully, all of our prep has paid off.

02:30:26.223 --> 02:30:26.723
Thanks, Melanie.

02:30:27.243 --> 02:30:31.285
So, good morning, President Kirst, members of the State Board, Chief Deputy Price.

02:30:32.045 --> 02:30:35.546
I'm Jason Willis with the California Comprehensive Center at WestEd.

02:30:35.946 --> 02:30:42.328
We're helping to facilitate the design and cross-agency collaboration around the system of support.

02:30:42.368 --> 02:30:48.110
So, as Melanie has mentioned, today is about what will be happening in the 17-18 school year to support our LEAs.

02:30:48.650 --> 02:30:50.271
that are in need of technical assistance.

02:30:51.012 --> 02:30:57.296
So before my colleagues dive in a little bit deeper, I want to take a moment to put today's conversation in context.

02:30:58.137 --> 02:31:03.000
Over the preceding months, there's been a growing crescendo about the system of support, what it is and what it'll do.

02:31:03.621 --> 02:31:07.223
Today's presentation and associated board item offers further definition.

02:31:08.244 --> 02:31:22.347
And I would also caution that while we seek to know exactly what it will be, that we not lose sight of what experience and research tells us, that building this system of support reflective of our LCFF principles will be neither easy or expedient.

02:31:23.067 --> 02:31:34.209
The stated goal for the system of support is the first signal of this magnanimous shift that is required of anyone that would label themselves as a support provider in California's public education system.

02:31:35.029 --> 02:31:50.457
Many of the key phrases you can see in the goal statement, building capacity, sustaining improvement, effectively addressing inequities, echo the spirit of LCFF, but more importantly suggest that practitioners and the support providers that support them are engaged in continuous improvement.

02:31:51.938 --> 02:31:56.604
This term of continuous improvement has been frequently used in our vocabulary over the last couple of years.

02:31:57.205 --> 02:32:01.791
In fact, the July state board items mentioned the term nearly three times.

02:32:02.371 --> 02:32:09.340
A small if not powerful signal that this is the way that we want to achieve improvement for all 6.2 million of our kiddos in California.

02:32:10.495 --> 02:32:23.199
And as a former senior district leader, I've wrestled a lot, as I know many of my colleagues have, between taking the time to build a system that will endure and addressing the urgency that students currently do not have access to the opportunities that they deserve.

02:32:24.199 --> 02:32:29.941
An important understanding is that when continuous improvement is implemented well, both of these outcomes are achieved.

02:32:31.321 --> 02:32:33.522
Just not in the manner that we collectively know today.

02:32:34.022 --> 02:32:40.084
A small example of this is the data by which we use to establish an answer to the question, are we improving?

02:32:41.414 --> 02:32:55.434
While the dashboard offers us the summative long-term trend necessary for California schools, we understand that it's inadequate to determine progress on a week-to-week basis in our classrooms, on a month-to-month basis in our schools, in our central offices.

02:32:56.926 --> 02:33:07.812
Hence, our conversations must evolve from simply looking at summative measures to defining, collecting, and analyzing, and responding to interim measures that surface the progress on a much more rapid basis.

02:33:08.573 --> 02:33:23.862
As a closely associated term of capacity is used with our discussions of this system of support, it may perhaps suggest that studying and understanding the way that adults are changing and growing their mindsets, skills, and abilities is a place to pay attention to.

02:33:26.812 --> 02:33:33.075
So Follin recently mentioned in a report that he released, quote, we know we don't want in this state.

02:33:34.375 --> 02:33:41.299
The shifts that you see on the screen affirm what we are moving away from on the left-hand side and articulates what we want in the future.

02:33:41.919 --> 02:33:47.281
While it's easy and elegant to put this on a screen, this work of making this shift cannot be understated.

02:33:47.982 --> 02:33:49.142
Einstein says it best.

02:33:49.742 --> 02:33:55.505
Significant problems we face today cannot be solved at the same level of thinking in which they were used to create.

02:33:56.798 --> 02:34:00.242
In that spirit, let me take a moment to just expand on some of these shifts.

02:34:01.104 --> 02:34:07.512
Number one, the first shift speaks to the way in which support providers approach, engage, and interact with LEAs.

02:34:07.852 --> 02:34:15.482
As you will hear later, there's an acknowledgment that these relationships between support providers and LEAs need to evolve significantly.

02:34:16.994 --> 02:34:26.341
The second shift is illustrative of moving away from the structures of previous state intervention programs such as IIUSP, HPSG, and SIG.

02:34:27.322 --> 02:34:40.892
This shift entails support providers generate garnering empathy for the challenges and complexities that local practitioners face, and taking this stance appropriately leads to key challenges and opportunities that are at the heart of what matters most for our local communities.

02:34:43.243 --> 02:34:54.787
I want to touch for just a moment on Attachment 1, which was a review that many of my colleagues did at WestEd around the research and evidence of previous improvement efforts here in California.

02:34:55.608 --> 02:35:02.990
Overall, our survey of evaluation and research reports have shown a positive impact, but not one that has been sustained over time.

02:35:03.350 --> 02:35:07.272
Again, I will reference you back to our goal around sustained improvement.

02:35:07.992 --> 02:35:18.835
In fact, often many small advantage that was demonstrated during the program participation dissipated after program completion.

02:35:19.955 --> 02:35:22.656
Flowing from this are several recommendations of particular note.

02:35:23.556 --> 02:35:34.399
You can see on that first recommendation that one, it's a recognition that our school systems are dynamic and complex webs of interactive loops rather than compartmentalized units following clear chains of command.

02:35:35.767 --> 02:35:39.529
Hence, we must acknowledge that reality and shape the approach accordingly.

02:35:40.349 --> 02:36:00.457
And the second recommendation takes me to the analogy of Goldilocks, that striking the balance is really essential here in understanding that we need to be able to customize to the needs of our LEAs, but understand that if we are going to grow as a system in California, that we need to be able to surface and bring along with us lessons that can be applied across these other systems.

02:36:03.018 --> 02:36:13.811
So in addition to what we can learn from research and from previous efforts, we also know that local educators and stakeholders have lived experiences that inform what they need from our system of support.

02:36:14.591 --> 02:36:19.935
So, in addition to the last CPAC meetings, we also collected feedback from district teams throughout August.

02:36:20.415 --> 02:36:28.001
And we tried to identify teams that have been a part of improvement efforts in the past or potentially could be a part of improvement efforts in the future.

02:36:28.782 --> 02:36:39.950
The purpose of these stakeholder engagements was not only to talk about what does support mean to them and what will they need, but also to review and reflect on the overall California accountability and continuous improvement system.

02:36:40.851 --> 02:36:51.651
You'll be able to see parallels between the research that Jason just did a quick overview on and the shifts and change efforts with what stakeholders are saying they need.

02:36:51.971 --> 02:36:53.554
Just a few bullets on this slide about that.

02:36:54.671 --> 02:36:59.975
One interesting thing that we wanted to do in August was pilot different ways of getting stakeholder feedback.

02:37:00.476 --> 02:37:01.576
So we partnered with Kern.

02:37:02.017 --> 02:37:02.938
Thank you so much, Kern.

02:37:03.638 --> 02:37:11.244
And we did a hybrid in-person virtual feedback session where my staff were beamed in virtually to

02:37:12.945 --> 02:37:20.730
Kern County in one of the meetings they had and they were able to get feedback from over a hundred leaders in the different Districts in Kern County.

02:37:21.271 --> 02:37:42.565
We really wanted to use August to pilot some different ways of getting feedback So then over the next three months we could make sure that we're doing we're using as many different innovative methods as possible and are Doing it in collaboration with other agencies so that we can build that relationship I now have such a strong I have a stronger relationship with Kern and both organizations got to hear that feedback It wasn't just you know CDE and

02:37:42.645 --> 02:37:43.145
isolation.

02:37:44.465 --> 02:37:50.827
So moving forward, we'll build off what we learned from the August sessions to create a broader approach that continues to partner with other agencies.

02:37:51.487 --> 02:37:57.669
We will make sure that we engage with teachers, families, and community members in addition to staff at schools and districts.

02:37:58.769 --> 02:38:02.690
And ideally our questions will evolve and we'll be able to ask folks, so how is it going?

02:38:03.250 --> 02:38:05.870
How is the support that you're engaged with working?

02:38:06.131 --> 02:38:11.612
And be able to use that as a feedback loop so that we can continue to make sure our support is responsive.

02:38:12.532 --> 02:38:16.155
I also look forward to working with other agencies.

02:38:16.215 --> 02:38:20.338
Many have already reached out to talk about how we could do something collaborative in the upcoming months.

02:38:21.914 --> 02:38:29.339
So, another part of the framing that I want to briefly discuss are some of the elements that the cross-agency scene has started to develop.

02:38:29.659 --> 02:38:31.040
You can see four of them listed here.

02:38:31.060 --> 02:38:33.942
I want to focus primarily on bullets three and four.

02:38:35.102 --> 02:38:43.668
So, part of the development of this, one, is derived from statute, two, is derived from the conversations that these cross-agencies

02:38:44.208 --> 02:39:02.075
teams have been having about what's going to be necessary, again, holding that balance between being able to create customization for our LEAs, but also able to create a standardized approach, particularly in some of the early goings of things like, for example, pathways to support and assistance, that initial outreach to LEAs.

02:39:02.995 --> 02:39:12.817
So when we think about needs assessment analysis of our student outcomes, one of Peter Senge's quotes actually comes very closely to mind when thinking about this.

02:39:13.438 --> 02:39:30.302
That more often than not, as a system's efforts makes underlying structures clear through a needs assessment, members of the group that are involved in trying to identify those needs have met moments of despair, vulnerabilities, limited understandings, infallibilities about what's happened in the past.

02:39:31.121 --> 02:39:32.842
But actually, things are getting better.

02:39:33.442 --> 02:39:40.084
People see formally undiscussable problems rising to the surface, suddenly being put on the table for a pretty honest conversation.

02:39:40.944 --> 02:39:56.529
And they realize how their old beloved ways of thinking about their system and their work have actually created the current problems, and discover that clearly there's an issue to be addressed, and that those around the table are the start of making steps towards that progress.

02:39:57.789 --> 02:40:02.830
The fourth bullet as it is, the support to districts and schools to improve student outcomes.

02:40:03.530 --> 02:40:06.091
This is clearly the heart of this system.

02:40:07.211 --> 02:40:09.632
And I want to make two points on this fourth element.

02:40:10.092 --> 02:40:14.293
And again, my colleagues will expand on some of this work a little bit later in the presentation.

02:40:14.333 --> 02:40:23.915
Number one, that as has been implied through the goal characteristics and shifts and support, that we should not and cannot be our typical version of stand and deliver training.

02:40:24.495 --> 02:40:29.137
It requires more of both those supporting our practitioners and the practitioners themselves.

02:40:29.998 --> 02:40:41.423
And second, that LEA's needs, very significantly intense, the type, function, design, and delivery of the sport are going to look different across our LEAs.

02:40:41.943 --> 02:40:45.905
And to note that this is not something that we are particularly good at here in California.

02:40:46.445 --> 02:40:51.307
So having recognized that need, we know it is an issue, we are going to have to be able to take it head on.

02:40:52.133 --> 02:41:00.280
And therefore, that we need to try some ways in which to provide this differentiated support, observe what that progress looks like, then rigorously assess how to get better at it.

02:41:00.580 --> 02:41:11.049
That we're not going to be able to take and bite off the entire apple, but if we start in a place and see what we learn working together collectively, that progress will come sooner than we think.

02:41:13.001 --> 02:41:14.742
Now, I know you love hearing me and Jason.

02:41:15.323 --> 02:41:17.584
We went over this presentation many times on our commutes, Tom.

02:41:17.745 --> 02:41:18.065
It's true.

02:41:18.225 --> 02:41:20.707
But sadly, we will now step aside.

02:41:21.107 --> 02:41:30.554
And we want to create the space for our colleagues across California to share and highlight what their actual work looks like for the fall.

02:41:31.675 --> 02:41:38.400
Throughout the presentations, you'll see evidence of the shifts that Jason mentioned in the beginning and the elements of support that he talked about later.

02:41:41.192 --> 02:41:46.196
First, we'll have Peter Birdsall and Ed Manansala discuss the county office coordinated approach to support.

02:41:46.617 --> 02:41:52.582
Then we'll have Mary Barlow and Dave Gordon, and each of them will highlight the work of their county office of education.

02:41:53.203 --> 02:41:57.947
Then Socorro Shields and Stephanie Gregson will come up to discuss the focus of CDE and CCE.

02:41:58.447 --> 02:42:02.491
At the end, you will have me again, but this time not with Jason, it will be Socorro.

02:42:02.771 --> 02:42:07.816
Socorro and I will discuss the next steps for the cross-agency team, and then open it up to any questions to you.

02:42:08.476 --> 02:42:11.637
So, first up, can I please have Peter Birdsall and Ed Manasalla.

02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:18.900
Make sure I know how to run this.

02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:20.761
Yep, great.

02:42:21.341 --> 02:42:25.503
Well, thank you, Peter Birdsall, Executive Director of CCESA, the County Superintendents Association.

02:42:26.283 --> 02:42:32.906
I was asked just to give a real quick flyby on the collective effort of the County Superintendents to support implementation of LCAP and LCFF.

02:42:34.146 --> 02:42:37.627
The first two items you see there are actually now institutionalized as part of the system.

02:42:37.687 --> 02:42:41.769
As you know, LCFF was not just a new accountability system, but it was a whole new funding system.

02:42:42.349 --> 02:42:45.430
And districts and counties needed a way to project what their revenues would be.

02:42:46.330 --> 02:42:52.833
It was the CBOs from the counties that worked with the Department of Finance, Department of Education, developed what's now called the LCFF calculator.

02:42:53.853 --> 02:42:55.474
That is now embedded in FCMAT.

02:42:55.514 --> 02:43:01.037
They maintain that as a mechanism to project the revenue as part of the budget fiscal process.

02:43:01.778 --> 02:43:06.780
We also annually develop the LCAP approval manual, which is more of a technical document.

02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:13.224
It's not the continuous improvement discussion, but it's what's required of the LCAP, what are the expectations, what are the criteria for review and approval.

02:43:13.944 --> 02:43:18.245
We update that regularly and share it with districts, parents, community groups, etc.

02:43:18.325 --> 02:43:19.585
So, there's a common understanding.

02:43:19.605 --> 02:43:28.747
14-15 was a difficult year for us, to be honest, because counties were expected to repurpose some of their funding to support this effort.

02:43:29.307 --> 02:43:33.828
But at the same time, the law required that we continue spending money on some of the existing categoricals.

02:43:34.048 --> 02:43:36.848
So, that created some tensions, you can imagine.

02:43:37.348 --> 02:43:42.189
Fortunately, by 15-16, that was largely resolved and every county was able to start

02:43:42.729 --> 02:43:46.474
hiring the staff, putting in place the support systems for their school districts.

02:43:47.475 --> 02:43:56.965
So that set us up fortunately for 16-17, which was a critical year because that's the year the State Board adopted the rubrics and the dashboard and the revised template.

02:43:57.986 --> 02:44:09.394
I think the key thing for my part of the presentation is that the counties view it as their responsibility to work with and support every school district in the state, train them on these requirements, support them through the process.

02:44:09.474 --> 02:44:11.795
So, we're the ones that reach to every school district.

02:44:13.236 --> 02:44:18.620
So, what we did to support that is we did four full days of training.

02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:22.242
These are not repeats, not the second same as first.

02:44:22.282 --> 02:44:26.745
They built on each other so you got a deeper and deeper level of collaboration and understanding.

02:44:27.625 --> 02:44:33.869
It says here all county offices are 51 county offices of education to review and approve school district LCAPs.

02:44:34.450 --> 02:44:37.892
So, we made sure there were teams there from every one of those 51 counties.

02:44:37.932 --> 02:44:41.995
So, they were all there for all those meetings to work together going through that process.

02:44:42.796 --> 02:44:49.280
The material was collaboratively developed, not only among the counties, but also was reviewed in advance with staff from the State Board and the Department.

02:44:49.761 --> 02:44:53.703
And in fact, staff from the State Board and the Department helped with some of the presentations.

02:44:54.464 --> 02:45:02.289
And then finally, CC, we're really happy they were able to fund some county lead in each county, in each region rather.

02:45:02.914 --> 02:45:10.077
to support work across the 11 CCESS regions and also help with communications between the local level and the state.

02:45:11.798 --> 02:45:15.920
So now moving to 17-18, obviously technical assistance.

02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:20.842
We all know now that the requirements are going to come into play for counties to provide technical assistance.

02:45:21.982 --> 02:45:29.244
We are extremely supportive and pleased with the cross-agency strategies put in place as being facilitated by state board staff.

02:45:29.684 --> 02:45:35.186
It's really helping bring people together in terms of a clear communication and plan for supporting this.

02:45:36.566 --> 02:45:40.968
Like everybody else, we're trying to make sure we make the move from a compliance mindset to continuous improvement.

02:45:41.028 --> 02:45:43.869
So, the workshops we're doing this time is sort of an operating system here now.

02:45:44.389 --> 02:45:48.210
We're doing workshops over several months, three of them, September through January.

02:45:49.094 --> 02:45:56.984
All the counties are involved, we also have school staff involved and also CC, State Board, Department, etc.

02:45:57.485 --> 02:46:00.489
focusing on continuous improvement and what does that mean.

02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:09.365
Carnegie Foundation is helping us on that because they have a strong track record of applying improvement science to K-12 education systems.

02:46:09.866 --> 02:46:12.428
And these workshops are co-sponsored by CCE.

02:46:12.868 --> 02:46:18.773
So the idea of collaboration, all counties reaching all school districts, I think we now have a system in place to support that model.

02:46:19.373 --> 02:46:21.214
So I was asked to, like I said, do a flyby.

02:46:21.375 --> 02:46:25.478
I'll be happy to answer more questions, but I'd like to turn now to Ed Monticella from El Dorado County.

02:46:25.698 --> 02:46:25.998
Thank you.

02:46:32.177 --> 02:46:41.563
They're convened by the State Board of Education, but it's a staff, State Board, Department of Education, CCESA, CCEE, and WestEd.

02:46:42.944 --> 02:46:53.130
So those are the organizations that are working together collaboratively to make sure we have a system of support for all the different, as Sue mentioned, diversity of school districts out there.

02:46:57.671 --> 02:47:02.674
Good morning, President Kirst, members of the State Board of Education and Chief Deputy Glenn Price.

02:47:03.414 --> 02:47:04.315
My name is Ed Madonsel.

02:47:04.335 --> 02:47:06.436
I'm the County Superintendent of El Dorado County.

02:47:07.057 --> 02:47:15.702
And this morning, I'm just going to briefly share with you how in El Dorado County we're shifting our delivery and support system with our districts.

02:47:16.442 --> 02:47:27.209
And I do want to note that County Superintendents Dave Gordon and Mary Barlow will provide a greater detail of how counties are delivering a comprehensive support system in the midst of the change.

02:47:27.729 --> 02:47:33.656
So just to provide greater perspective and context, in El Dorado County, there are 15 school districts.

02:47:33.736 --> 02:47:40.904
We do have multiple small districts with 100 students or less and districts that are in the thousands.

02:47:41.445 --> 02:47:47.072
You can picture El Dorado Hills on the western part of the county to South Lake Tahoe.

02:47:47.652 --> 02:47:50.214
and we're very diverse in nature.

02:47:50.815 --> 02:48:02.463
Back in 13-14 when LCFF was being implemented, there was just some overarching questions that were being raised amongst our leaders and schools.

02:48:02.883 --> 02:48:11.230
So one in particular was how are we best going to use the LCAP to continue with the areas of improvement that we focused on.

02:48:11.250 --> 02:48:11.350
So

02:48:12.610 --> 02:48:26.978
For example, Chris Hoffman, current superintendent in Elk Grove, was the superintendent at Eldorado Union High School District at the time, and he saw that as an opportunity to focus on a few goals, on the areas that they were already zeroing in on.

02:48:27.458 --> 02:48:37.743
Yet, with that said, there was still that sense of ambivalence and ensuring that districts were aware that we are going to go through a process

02:48:38.283 --> 02:48:46.826
But how do we continue to maintain a steadfast focus on improving instruction and learning during these entire shifts?

02:48:46.886 --> 02:48:50.308
So a lot of change was occurring during that time.

02:48:50.368 --> 02:49:00.751
We did see, even in the first two years of implementation, a focus on achievement, specifically around math and ELA.

02:49:01.212 --> 02:49:07.194
But even most recently, themes that we're seeing in our LCAPs are now starting to focus around social-emotional learning.

02:49:07.774 --> 02:49:17.203
and how can we provide greater comprehensive supports around our students with needs ultimately to achieve higher levels.

02:49:17.784 --> 02:49:22.888
When we look at the change over the last four years, it is very complex.

02:49:23.489 --> 02:49:32.678
And while we could look at change from LCFF and the implementation of LCAP, we want to give you a sense of what change looks like even at the leadership level in El Dorado County.

02:49:33.098 --> 02:49:44.520
So when I began at the county office in June 2013 to today, there are 11 new district superintendents out of the 15.

02:49:45.920 --> 02:50:00.183
So there's significant change that we're talking about around our system, but also with the leaders, which then leads our county office to raise the question, how do we create a collaborative support structure that could manage even leadership change

02:50:00.623 --> 02:50:10.545
in the midst of this complex change, which then led to even an example around the implementation of Common Core, specifically around math.

02:50:10.905 --> 02:50:26.188
So while we were implementing LCAP in 13-14 and providing that training, there was a discussion around, are we going to move, again, a complex system of districts that feed into each other?

02:50:27.228 --> 02:50:30.151
How are we going to approach integrated math or traditional math?

02:50:30.471 --> 02:50:31.893
And that was a very hot topic.

02:50:31.953 --> 02:50:38.159
What became evident is we did not have the learning support structure or collaborative structure to go in depth.

02:50:38.239 --> 02:50:42.484
But LCFF, through this dialogue around the transformation of

02:50:42.944 --> 02:50:50.611
change and support around our districts has led us to a rural professional learning network where we meet across our districts once a month.

02:50:51.472 --> 02:50:55.436
And that has been a great place to identify problems of practice.

02:50:55.996 --> 02:51:06.246
And the most recent problem of practice that we've been working on this last year is the improvement of math instructional strategies and looking at mindset.

02:51:07.253 --> 02:51:08.734
So with that said, let me conclude.

02:51:08.754 --> 02:51:27.364
You know, when I was a principal or a district superintendent prior to LCFF, there were times where I felt like I was shielding or buffering classrooms or schools from a punitive accountability standpoint in order that they can focus on just deep collaboration and focusing on instruction and learning.

02:51:27.864 --> 02:51:32.927
In contrast, last week after our Rural Professional Learning Network,

02:51:34.269 --> 02:51:49.183
We had a superintendent by the name of Marcy Guthrie who said, I'm very thankful for these new collaborative support structures across districts because it allows me to look at some of the most challenging problems of practice in a safe environment.

02:51:50.744 --> 02:51:56.229
So I think we are on track as a state and it's reflected in our county.

02:51:56.610 --> 02:51:56.890
Thank you.

02:52:12.697 --> 02:52:17.301
Good morning, members of the board, Dr. Price.

02:52:17.321 --> 02:52:22.466
I am Dave Gordon, the County Superintendent in Sacramento County.

02:52:23.106 --> 02:52:34.356
And first of all, I want to give a shout out to your staff at the State Board, the CDE staff, the CCE staff, the CESSA staff,

02:52:35.327 --> 02:52:44.332
They have created a tremendous collaborative environment of problem solving to get to this point in shaping the system of support.

02:52:44.812 --> 02:52:53.037
There's a long way to go to perfect it, but I think they have served you well in creating the climate where it can be developed.

02:52:53.097 --> 02:52:55.198
It's been a very, very collaborative process.

02:52:55.258 --> 02:53:02.342
And I remember back to when we talked about standards implementation two or three years ago, they've done exactly the same thing.

02:53:03.252 --> 02:53:12.136
with that and Tom Adams and all of his staff and Carrick Ashley have done a wonderful job of rolling out framework.

02:53:12.176 --> 02:53:14.578
So, it's a great environment.

02:53:15.138 --> 02:53:23.562
Sacramento is 240,000 students in the county, but we have six of our districts range from 63,000 students to 15,000 students.

02:53:23.602 --> 02:53:25.343
The other seven range from

02:53:30.532 --> 02:53:37.556
about 5,000 down to our two little districts or 400 students and 244 students.

02:53:37.596 --> 02:53:44.981
You wouldn't think in a metropolis like Sacramento, we'd have that range as member Burr mentioned.

02:53:45.061 --> 02:53:53.546
So, our effort is to really support and customize support along the wide range of the needs of all of those districts.

02:53:54.207 --> 02:53:54.347
So,

02:53:55.751 --> 02:54:01.998
We have in the county a range of very, very strong support services.

02:54:02.038 --> 02:54:05.683
And just to mention a few, we have customized professional development.

02:54:06.804 --> 02:54:12.451
We have a principal credential program which trains about 80 or 90 principals a year.

02:54:13.965 --> 02:54:24.752
We have now a teacher intern program where we're training math and science, single subject teachers, multiple subject elementary teachers.

02:54:24.972 --> 02:54:30.716
And we just started last year a mild moderate special education credential program.

02:54:30.736 --> 02:54:32.597
So we're trying to help districts in that way.

02:54:33.378 --> 02:54:39.342
We have a host of other services, but we have taken the approach that the heart of the matter

02:54:40.572 --> 02:54:47.214
is supporting and enhancing top quality first teaching classroom by classroom by classroom.

02:54:47.974 --> 02:54:50.575
And that starts with where do you get the teachers?

02:54:51.495 --> 02:54:52.475
How do you prepare them?

02:54:52.875 --> 02:54:55.836
And how do you continue their professional development?

02:54:56.776 --> 02:55:02.658
And again, the stability, as Superintendent Mananzalo mentioned, the stability of leadership

02:55:03.675 --> 02:55:09.040
in a district can't be understated in developing and sustaining those systems.

02:55:09.100 --> 02:55:11.462
So we also work with our districts.

02:55:11.482 --> 02:55:21.551
And I'm proud to say two years ago, we, for the first time, we didn't change a single superintendent out of our 13 districts.

02:55:22.532 --> 02:55:24.714
So move on to the next slide, please.

02:55:25.374 --> 02:55:26.715
Oh, I guess I've got to do that.

02:55:29.117 --> 02:55:29.498
Thank you.

02:55:31.201 --> 02:55:36.545
So again, our services are completely customized to schools.

02:55:36.625 --> 02:55:55.238
And as you can see on this slide, we focus on empowering continuous improvement in each school community because we think not just of the school district and its staff, but the whole community around the school district and how can they work in support.

02:55:55.298 --> 02:55:55.979
And I'll get to

02:56:00.434 --> 02:56:03.537
And I'll get to that in a moment.

02:56:03.637 --> 02:56:09.021
So again, we lead with a sustained focus on improved teaching and learning in the classrooms.

02:56:09.802 --> 02:56:12.104
We have a sophisticated data system.

02:56:12.204 --> 02:56:14.566
Each of our districts has bought into the core

02:56:15.923 --> 02:56:23.974
data system so we have an enhanced data system which uses the state data but can go beyond that to assist our districts.

02:56:25.076 --> 02:56:30.002
Community-based services and resources are very much taken into account.

02:56:30.823 --> 02:56:36.707
and we have a collaborative learning network of superintendents and other staff within our county.

02:56:37.408 --> 02:56:52.878
But I hasten to say, and this is an issue that's come up a number of times, a number of our districts are fruitfully engaged with other providers, other statewide networks, and receive support from all over the state.

02:56:52.958 --> 02:56:54.820
And that's a great asset to us

02:56:55.600 --> 02:57:07.490
because that learning that they get feeds back into helping our other districts within our county and also within our region, the 10-county region around Sacramento.

02:57:08.531 --> 02:57:18.079
And I should point out one of those networks is the Labor Management Collaborative, which has brought some tremendous ideas to us.

02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:23.284
And once again, we lead with promoting high-quality teaching and learning.

02:57:26.820 --> 02:57:43.940
And the final slide I'll mention is we decided based on our strong focus on equity that we would create a unique pilot in our county with our most needy community, which is the Robla School District, which is a district of about 2,100.

02:57:45.999 --> 02:57:59.396
of our most needy students in the county and with strong support from our county board of education and encouragement from them, we've created a pilot which is founded on let's do whatever it takes.

02:58:00.307 --> 02:58:03.731
to help the youngsters in this district be successful.

02:58:04.371 --> 02:58:09.958
And what that speaks to is the need for a powerful set of support services.

02:58:10.038 --> 02:58:15.243
So we partnered with the United Way and a host of other community partners.

02:58:15.884 --> 02:58:18.847
And we're also working on health, nutrition,

02:58:19.790 --> 02:58:24.512
housing, tutoring and a variety of other services that are brought to the district.

02:58:24.612 --> 02:58:32.697
But again, as you see in Robla's LCAP goals, the core is top quality classroom instruction.

02:58:33.317 --> 02:58:35.878
So I will stop there and turn it over to Mary.

02:58:38.259 --> 02:58:39.000
Thank you so much.

02:58:40.733 --> 02:58:52.422
I really appreciate the opportunity to be here, President Kirst, Deputy Price, and of course, distinguished members of the board, so many of you that I've had an opportunity to observe.

02:58:52.522 --> 02:58:58.226
Being a part of this cross-agency collaborative has really made a difference to the work in Kern County.

02:58:58.667 --> 02:59:01.609
We've learned so much in a very short period of time.

02:59:01.629 --> 02:59:06.492
What I want to do today is frame for you a little bit about Kern County first,

02:59:07.433 --> 02:59:11.616
and so that you can understand our model and how it was arrived at.

02:59:12.396 --> 02:59:15.538
Kern County is the third largest county in California.

02:59:15.558 --> 02:59:17.440
It covers 8,000 square miles.

02:59:17.500 --> 02:59:19.501
We have 47 school districts.

02:59:20.201 --> 02:59:22.723
Some districts have as few as eight students.

02:59:23.343 --> 02:59:30.408
Some districts are the largest high school district in the state, Kern High School District, the largest elementary school district, Bakersfield City School District,

02:59:31.188 --> 02:59:32.909
with over 38,000 students.

02:59:32.929 --> 02:59:34.529
So we're talking about a wide range.

02:59:34.629 --> 02:59:37.230
We are a microcosm of the state of California.

02:59:37.810 --> 02:59:40.710
We have very rural districts, we have urban districts.

02:59:41.651 --> 02:59:45.471
We serve over 185,000 students, K-12.

02:59:46.112 --> 02:59:55.734
Of those students, about 72% are eligible for free and reduced lunch, so they have some low income issues that they bring to school, some real challenges.

02:59:56.621 --> 03:00:09.433
In addition to that, 22% of our students are English language learners and we know that in over 20 of our districts have unduplicated counts of over 85%.

03:00:10.153 --> 03:00:17.120
We have the eighth largest population of foster students in our county, so it is a very challenging

03:00:18.781 --> 03:00:30.947
demographic, but more importantly, because we're so widespread, we have to look at it a little bit more creatively in how we support those school district superintendents.

03:00:31.447 --> 03:00:37.190
Keep in mind of those 47 school districts, 21 of them have fewer than 1,000 students,

03:00:39.592 --> 03:00:42.214
14 of those superintendents also serve as principals.

03:00:42.815 --> 03:00:52.265
So that means the structure that our county office prepares to support those situations will look very different than it might in another county office.

03:00:53.831 --> 03:00:57.952
Okay, that is also why there is such an urgency.

03:00:58.412 --> 03:01:08.754
You might look at the data from the recently released CASP results, Smarter Balance, and you can see very clearly on the California School Dashboard that we have a long way to go.

03:01:09.414 --> 03:01:16.235
Our gap is greater than the rest of the state of California, and we have a sense of urgency, and we do not want to waste a year.

03:01:16.455 --> 03:01:19.956
We really want to see some great progress for our students.

03:01:20.376 --> 03:01:24.859
And so we are embracing and learning from our colleagues across the state.

03:01:25.219 --> 03:01:32.685
We've spent a lot of time in other county offices, finding out what they're doing and taking it back to our office and making it work for us.

03:01:33.860 --> 03:01:41.785
Since 2014, we began hosting workshops really focusing on what is authentic community engagement?

03:01:42.145 --> 03:01:46.188
How do we bring in the voices that are not traditionally heard at the table?

03:01:46.628 --> 03:01:56.675
How do we hear from parents who have students with disabilities, English language learners, those folks who are low income who cannot come to school during regular working hours and really need support?

03:01:57.155 --> 03:02:02.239
So we focused quite a bit on that as well as transparency with the ultimate goal

03:02:02.979 --> 03:02:06.261
of improving student engagement and student outcomes.

03:02:06.941 --> 03:02:08.863
To do that, we assigned teams.

03:02:09.103 --> 03:02:11.984
So we took three different approaches.

03:02:12.064 --> 03:02:17.608
We assigned former superintendents who are retired to work with school districts.

03:02:18.788 --> 03:02:23.049
We have about five of them, so essentially 10 apiece.

03:02:23.649 --> 03:02:29.790
And they work with them on policy issues as well as parent engagement and community engagement issues.

03:02:30.330 --> 03:02:38.772
We have a fiscal person who works with our school districts related to actually making sure the dollars are going to the students that they are intended to go to.

03:02:39.252 --> 03:02:45.473
So really making sure that those services are additional and improved for those students.

03:02:46.093 --> 03:02:52.356
The final thing is we put a curriculum expert in place for each and every school district.

03:02:52.396 --> 03:02:55.778
So that team of three works with school district leaders.

03:02:55.878 --> 03:03:07.443
We went out to the sites, met with them in their offices, looked at their school sites, and really got a clear idea of the context under which they were operating.

03:03:08.104 --> 03:03:12.446
And so from that, we met with the 47 school districts at the time.

03:03:13.246 --> 03:03:16.449
And we said, what do we need to do differently as a county office?

03:03:16.529 --> 03:03:17.950
And we started restructuring.

03:03:18.891 --> 03:03:36.606
When we restructured, we looked at not only those teams that were created because of the trusting relationship that would happen over time, but we looked at how we delivered professional development, how we delivered any type of support, and did that need to look a little bit differently?

03:03:36.666 --> 03:03:37.907
And yes, in fact, it did.

03:03:38.708 --> 03:03:40.949
There are some things that we stopped providing.

03:03:41.750 --> 03:03:49.719
There are some things that we then redirected those dollars, those resources in that time to providing what the district said they needed.

03:03:51.661 --> 03:04:00.910
Through that effort, we created a collaborative working team that looks at such things as multi-tiered systems of support.

03:04:01.551 --> 03:04:17.849
school community partnerships, the migrant program, the career technical education division, and together created a strategic plan so that we could align all of our efforts to meet the needs of our school districts in their context.

03:04:18.830 --> 03:04:26.092
We have an advisory board of superintendents who we meet with and at each iteration of our plan we ask them if we're getting it right.

03:04:26.592 --> 03:04:27.692
What are we not doing?

03:04:28.113 --> 03:04:29.733
What is it that we need to do differently?

03:04:30.473 --> 03:04:31.694
Is this approach working?

03:04:32.974 --> 03:04:43.837
Consistent with the message from York with the State Board of Education and in working in alignment with the CDE and with CCE as a pilot, we've learned that

03:04:44.917 --> 03:04:54.481
Similar to what Fullen has said, we need to tailor our responses to look at a continuous improvement process.

03:04:54.541 --> 03:05:02.484
Start where the district is and provide all supports that they can continuously improve from wherever they are.

03:05:04.218 --> 03:05:07.579
So in order to do that, we hired Michael Fullen.

03:05:07.759 --> 03:05:08.999
We worked with Innovate Ed.

03:05:09.539 --> 03:05:26.963
We brought in five new district representatives, former district level superintendents and assistant superintendents of instruction who had good experience with change and affecting change across school districts.

03:05:27.483 --> 03:05:30.424
And we assigned them to the school district teams.

03:05:31.044 --> 03:05:47.287
So in fact, now we have an expert in change who is working side by side with the district as they identify their needs to improve their systems and align their systems to better support teaching and learning in the classroom.

03:05:48.348 --> 03:06:01.375
That work through Michael Fullen and Innovate Ed was also aligned with cognitive coaching that was supplied to our internal team and the new pedagogies for deeper learning.

03:06:01.715 --> 03:06:04.217
So we recognize it's not just our districts.

03:06:04.797 --> 03:06:09.620
We need to develop our own capacity internally to be able to deliver support.

03:06:10.060 --> 03:06:16.946
We don't have all the answers, but we sure do know that we have colleagues in the field who can provide us with answers and support.

03:06:17.406 --> 03:06:24.492
And so that's the evolution of where we now arrive, which is the model of support before you.

03:06:25.353 --> 03:06:34.201
So the guiding principles of this model of support is that it's based on localized, contextualized needs of our LEAs.

03:06:34.421 --> 03:06:36.023
Again, we're going to them.

03:06:36.663 --> 03:06:41.948
Sometimes they come to us in a large group, but we're spending time at their site with them.

03:06:42.328 --> 03:06:44.770
We're focusing on building their capacity.

03:06:45.231 --> 03:06:46.652
We're co-learning with them.

03:06:47.392 --> 03:06:51.796
And we're looking at data, and we're using research-based practices.

03:06:52.657 --> 03:06:59.639
We found very quickly that we have a lot of expertise within our county that we can call upon.

03:07:00.140 --> 03:07:15.525
And so we now through our monthly meetings with such folks as our instructional leaders, our principals, and our district superintendents, we provide them the opportunity to share their best practices so that we can learn from one another.

03:07:16.005 --> 03:07:18.226
And then we team those districts together.

03:07:19.617 --> 03:07:27.247
So as you've seen here in the model of support, there are six areas that we focus on.

03:07:27.287 --> 03:07:28.629
I'll share that on the next slide.

03:07:28.669 --> 03:07:34.757
But you can also see that it's differentiated depending upon whether or not a district will in fact be eligible.

03:07:35.337 --> 03:07:48.207
In our early modeling with the data from last year, we believe we will have nine out of our 47 who would potentially be eligible for support differentiated assistance in this next year.

03:07:48.747 --> 03:07:51.169
And we want to be positioned to be able to do that.

03:07:51.629 --> 03:07:57.214
We want to be positioned to be able to find them the resources that they need to be successful.

03:07:58.379 --> 03:08:02.743
So building the capacity of our LEAs is our highest priority.

03:08:03.203 --> 03:08:06.606
We've been piloting this and we've been researching it.

03:08:06.666 --> 03:08:08.547
We did it three times so far.

03:08:09.028 --> 03:08:15.253
The first time we did it, we conducted a pilot with three districts and we learned a lot from that experience.

03:08:15.793 --> 03:08:22.739
A lot of looking in the mirror and finding out sometimes it's about our own expectations for children and changing adult behavior.

03:08:23.499 --> 03:08:33.584
And then when we piloted it with ourselves, thank you to our friends from CCEE who recognized we should go through that same painful experience that we're asking our districts to go through.

03:08:34.105 --> 03:08:38.247
And I will tell you that looking at yourself in the mirror and what you need to do differently,

03:08:38.707 --> 03:08:42.772
was a very good exercise and that is exactly what we're going through now.

03:08:43.212 --> 03:08:56.588
We're going to pilot it a third time here this fall with our internal programs, meaning our student programs, alternative education, special education, to learn to really facilitate that practice and have empathy with our districts.

03:08:57.168 --> 03:09:11.928
And what that means is we're better prepared now in the fall with the release of the dashboard than in January to start that practice with all of our school districts that are identified as eligible and those who choose to.

03:09:12.509 --> 03:09:20.113
You might notice on that prior model that it had support in all those six areas which you see on the screen in front of you.

03:09:20.653 --> 03:09:28.216
It is expected that our office will be providing a level of support to all 47 districts in those categories.

03:09:29.197 --> 03:09:31.258
It will be more intense if they're eligible.

03:09:31.878 --> 03:09:48.434
It is expected that all members of the professional learning team within our office, whether it be the management consultant working on policy, whether it be somebody helping with finance, or whether it be somebody delivering professional development, bases it upon the needs of the district.

03:09:48.795 --> 03:09:54.160
That the district has self-identified and that data demonstrate are absolutely needed.

03:09:54.720 --> 03:10:03.505
So we're really coming alongside the districts, we're working with them as partners, and we expect that co-learning to really be productive.

03:10:04.326 --> 03:10:07.247
Anecdotally, I want to share a few comments and then I'll wrap it up.

03:10:08.368 --> 03:10:10.709
Things that our district superintendents have said.

03:10:10.729 --> 03:10:14.211
This feels like PLCs for superintendents.

03:10:15.152 --> 03:10:20.475
It seems like all 47 of our districts are different schools and we're working together as one district.

03:10:21.761 --> 03:10:28.184
They feel like they're not competing against one another, but in fact, they're competing against themselves to improve.

03:10:28.925 --> 03:10:35.628
They enjoy learning from one another more than having someone else come in and share with them, so it's somebody who's in the same boat.

03:10:36.589 --> 03:10:44.433
And they like pooling their resources, particularly our very small schools, so that they can bring in outside experts, and that's what we hope to facilitate.

03:10:44.893 --> 03:10:53.966
And at the end of the day, no matter where a child lives, no matter what circumstances they were born in, we want them to be successful, productive, and contributing citizens.

03:10:54.407 --> 03:10:55.949
And that's our goal in Kern County.

03:10:56.990 --> 03:10:58.332
That's my summary.

03:11:07.421 --> 03:11:10.683
Good morning President Kirsch, Board Members, Chief Deputy Price.

03:11:10.723 --> 03:11:19.109
My name is Stephanie Gregson and I've been working at the California Department of Education for the past 15 months as the Director of the Curriculum Frameworks and Instructional Resources Division.

03:11:19.590 --> 03:11:24.333
Prior to this I was a K-12 Director of Curriculum at a local school district and a K-8 Principal.

03:11:24.894 --> 03:11:30.718
I'm extremely honored and privileged to discuss the support CDE is providing to our local education agencies.

03:11:31.298 --> 03:11:39.026
I'd like to start with looking at the various resources, strategies, and support CDE provides with the focus on improving instruction for all students.

03:11:39.546 --> 03:11:46.073
Particularly, CDE supports tailored to locally identified needs and support using a collaborative approach.

03:11:46.733 --> 03:11:52.499
Now, it would be impossible to display all of the support CDE provides as it is an exhaustive list.

03:11:53.079 --> 03:12:02.888
Instead, I'd like to focus on just a few of the supports in the area of staffing, teaching and learning, and climate that are directly affecting the classroom to improve instruction.

03:12:03.749 --> 03:12:08.210
We all know the benefits, as researcher Jim Collins would say, of having the right people on the bus.

03:12:08.870 --> 03:12:14.752
In other words, quality teaching, quality staffing, can lead to a positive impact on student success.

03:12:15.512 --> 03:12:21.674
CDE helps local education agencies engage their teachers and administrators in increasing their professional knowledge.

03:12:22.274 --> 03:12:35.878
Among our many resources, the Quality Schools Framework is just one that offers timely, vetted tools and practices to guide effective planning, policy, expenditure, and instructional decisions at all schools and districts.

03:12:36.438 --> 03:12:49.142
Topics can include assessment, culture and climate, curriculum, equity, family and community, engagement, instruction, leaders, professional learning, resource alignment, and teachers.

03:12:50.160 --> 03:12:54.242
Something that is near and dear to my heart is the area of teaching and learning.

03:12:54.842 --> 03:13:02.485
CDE provides guidance on the implementation of the California state standards through many avenues but most specifically the curriculum frameworks.

03:13:03.185 --> 03:13:13.149
CDE offers many resources and professional learning opportunities to help teachers and administrators glean the knowledge of the curriculum frameworks and enhance their instructional practices.

03:13:13.889 --> 03:13:24.322
CDE also supports districts in their decisions of adopting instructional resources that are aligned to the state standards and curriculum frameworks and that would best meet the needs of their students.

03:13:25.905 --> 03:13:29.207
We know the climate within each school can be critical for student success.

03:13:29.687 --> 03:13:31.908
There are many layers that contribute to climate.

03:13:32.348 --> 03:13:37.431
The spectrum ranges from school attendance, student engagement, to expanded learning opportunities.

03:13:37.931 --> 03:13:44.614
CDE offers hands-on support for school attendance through prevention, early identification, and intervention.

03:13:45.274 --> 03:13:52.458
Support for high-quality expanded learning opportunities is also provided by the CDE, working in conjunction with our local and regional partners.

03:13:53.138 --> 03:13:58.061
This was an extremely small and brief sampling of the support CDE offers.

03:13:58.601 --> 03:14:07.786
The array of current CDE support offered to all local education agencies focuses on improving student performance at the local education and school level.

03:14:08.206 --> 03:14:17.851
That includes recognition of success and the ability for our LEAs to share promising practices while complementing and supporting the local planning and accountability process.

03:14:19.830 --> 03:14:30.478
At the beginning of this year, CDE realized the potential of realigning the divisions and branches to enhance coordinated support and model after how school districts are organized.

03:14:31.039 --> 03:14:42.768
The realignment afforded CDE the opportunity to engage in collaborative practices to provide integrated and coordinated support to our local education agencies of California.

03:14:43.388 --> 03:14:46.893
The realignment was realized on July 1st, 2017.

03:14:47.434 --> 03:14:53.563
However, the realignment is not static, but will be refined through a defined continuous improvement process.

03:14:54.444 --> 03:14:58.830
I am personally excited about the realignment for many reasons, but I'll briefly talk about two.

03:14:59.631 --> 03:15:08.333
First, the realignment provides the opportunity for all divisions that affect teaching and learning to work collaboratively together and provide cohesion in our work.

03:15:08.794 --> 03:15:13.495
This means that special education and expanded learning have joined the teaching and learning support branch.

03:15:14.475 --> 03:15:28.139
Second, the realignment has allowed me to co-lead the CDE team that is engaged in a continuous improvement practice to ensure our coordinated and integrated support to our local education agencies can be as successful as possible.

03:15:30.396 --> 03:15:36.899
Finally, CDE's goal is to consistently provide support that impacts teaching and learning through integrated support.

03:15:37.519 --> 03:15:50.526
The LCAP, LCAP addendum process, and the dashboard are tools that allow the CDE to participate in internal continuous improvement process that mirrors that of which we are expecting our local education agencies to engage in.

03:15:51.306 --> 03:15:57.209
CDE will take specific steps internally to A, enhance our communication across divisions in the department,

03:15:57.809 --> 03:16:00.432
B, develop a coordinated professional learning system.

03:16:01.354 --> 03:16:05.799
C, engage in a continuous improvement practice at all levels to support integrated actions.

03:16:06.299 --> 03:16:12.006
And D, align our CDE cross-action teams for coordination within a statewide system of support.

03:16:13.087 --> 03:16:19.269
Each student deserves to live, work, and thrive in a multicultural, multilingual, and highly connected world.

03:16:19.829 --> 03:16:25.411
California believes that educators want to excel and trust them to improve when given the proper supports.

03:16:25.891 --> 03:16:33.613
We also believe that local schools and districts will improve when empowered to determine how to best utilize resources for continuous improvement.

03:16:34.253 --> 03:16:51.915
CDE itself is engaging in a continuous improvement process to constantly be able to provide support and guidance to allow our local education agencies to make informed decisions to meet their local needs and positively impact the teaching and learning of all of our California students.

03:16:54.682 --> 03:16:58.065
Good morning, board members, President Kirst and Deputy Price.

03:16:58.525 --> 03:17:03.469
My name is Socorro Shields, and I am representing the work of the California Collaborative today.

03:17:04.130 --> 03:17:18.741
I'm thankful for the collaborative work and being a part of it that's begun at the state level, all in service to supporting LEAs with LCFF implementation, continuous improvement, and equity and excellence for every student in our state.

03:17:19.702 --> 03:17:27.604
You've previously heard from my colleagues Josh Daniels and Ish Rayaru details of the professional development experiences of the CCE.

03:17:28.584 --> 03:17:37.306
At that same time, you heard the foundational beliefs that underpin all of our work and are echoed in LCFF.

03:17:37.946 --> 03:17:48.888
With great respect for the local level, we are committed to informed and empowered engagement in system level problem solving, resulting ultimately in increased student achievement.

03:17:49.688 --> 03:18:01.921
Through our 57 networks and 10 plus pilots, we are learning what type of unique support LEAs need to reach their goals with the expertise and resources they have or need to have.

03:18:02.261 --> 03:18:03.863
We are intentional and purposeful.

03:18:04.844 --> 03:18:18.410
in unpacking the way in which the individuals in that organization are making sense of the new LCSFF context and the ways in which their current skills need to be enhanced to maximize the entire effort.

03:18:18.870 --> 03:18:28.815
This working theory of action reflects the ultimate goals of our work and reveals the great emphasis we place on the LEAs themselves, the stakeholders themselves,

03:18:30.467 --> 03:18:38.943
solving their own problems and developing the best decision-making muscles for their organization and ultimately for the students they serve.

03:18:41.781 --> 03:18:55.331
Our early learnings really stress the tension that staffs and communities may experience in both focusing while at the same time meeting the wide needs and all important aspects of students for their success.

03:18:55.812 --> 03:19:04.899
Empowering stakeholders in collaboration throughout the continuous improvement process is still something all our LEAs are learning to do well.

03:19:05.439 --> 03:19:10.143
As with our new dashboard, it is important to consider both status and change.

03:19:10.703 --> 03:19:18.113
and to know the great strides LEAs have made while simultaneously understanding that there might never be a finally there.

03:19:19.306 --> 03:19:33.057
We are extremely conscious of the great responsibility for this opportunity to be different and what's afforded to us by LCFF to affect every level of leadership in our school systems, including teachers, parents, and our students themselves.

03:19:33.798 --> 03:19:41.024
We are intentional in our exploration of what work brings all of these experts, innovators, and compassionate professionals together.

03:19:42.148 --> 03:19:47.570
that are in the communities and organizations themselves that bring success to every student.

03:19:48.110 --> 03:19:53.872
Identifying, creating the right conditions for LEAs to find their own success is our journey.

03:20:03.275 --> 03:20:03.935
As shared,

03:20:05.393 --> 03:20:12.396
In this item and many previous items that you've heard, LEAs are working to focus, align, and break silos for the sake of students.

03:20:13.096 --> 03:20:24.600
We as supporters of LEAs, be that whether we're state agencies or any other working with districts, also need to work to figure out how we come together in an integrated fashion while working with districts.

03:20:25.300 --> 03:20:31.743
The responsibility of integration and coherence is not just for LEAs alone, but for all of us working with them.

03:20:32.723 --> 03:20:37.348
Breaking down our own fiefdoms, our own proprietary notions, is a shift.

03:20:38.476 --> 03:20:41.837
but an important one if we are to make this work for students.

03:20:42.297 --> 03:20:51.201
Believing that LEAs can and must figure out their own way to strong systems, serving and supporting students and families may seem like a frightening experience.

03:20:51.521 --> 03:21:05.286
But as we've heard today from our synthesis of past experiences in this state, working alongside LEAs rather than dictating change holds the most hope for sustained systems level work.

03:21:06.482 --> 03:21:32.982
We have to diligently work in cooperation and in collaboration to figure out what that looks like, commit ourselves, as you heard from Mary and others, to continuously improve, make sure we are empowering and engaging all of our stakeholders, similar to the work that LEAs themselves are doing, and commit to change and be the new and improved services and leave no LCFF opportunity on the table.

03:21:34.346 --> 03:21:38.650
So, I know we started this item talking about how we were zooming in to highlight support for Fall 2017-18.

03:21:38.711 --> 03:21:47.680
We're ending zooming out to show you the focus of what the cross-agency group is going to continue to collaborate on and engage with stakeholders with.

03:21:48.160 --> 03:21:51.924
So, Socorro just had the first two questions on this slide.

03:21:52.625 --> 03:21:53.125
We have...

03:21:54.987 --> 03:21:56.888
Really, for bullet number two, it's my favorite.

03:21:56.968 --> 03:21:59.149
How can California encourage partnerships?

03:21:59.669 --> 03:22:04.951
And then you see all the different stakeholders listed after that.

03:22:05.071 --> 03:22:14.394
And so the group will continue to think about how can California encourage partnerships among county office of education, professional associations, LEAs, institutes of higher education, research organizations.

03:22:14.474 --> 03:22:15.615
We tried not to leave anyone out.

03:22:16.075 --> 03:22:23.838
Private providers and others to connect LEAs and schools with resources and supports responsive to locally identified needs.

03:22:25.614 --> 03:22:33.579
The next slide continues to talk about the focus and what the work that the cross-agency team will continue to collaborate on.

03:22:34.559 --> 03:22:42.263
Finally, next steps, we want to make sure that we're continuing to gather feedback from local educators and that what we're asking them evolves.

03:22:42.343 --> 03:22:43.504
And that's what I mentioned in the beginning.

03:22:43.564 --> 03:22:50.648
We go from what's the support that you need to how is the support that you're getting going and how can we feed that back into the system as a feedback loop.

03:22:51.368 --> 03:22:56.210
We're also going to continue to coordinate and align the work of each agency through the cross-agency group mentioned earlier.

03:22:56.870 --> 03:23:01.471
And also, we want to use an update on the system of support to continue to highlight the work from the field.

03:23:01.791 --> 03:23:10.634
So, for November State Board meeting, we'd like to bring the Orange County Office of Education to talk about their work with MTSS and SUMS, just as an example.

03:23:10.694 --> 03:23:15.216
So, if you have any examples of who you'd like to hear from, let me know, msheppey at cde.ca.gov.

03:23:17.136 --> 03:23:18.317
You'll probably know where to find me.

03:23:19.277 --> 03:23:21.358
And in that, this concludes our presentation.

03:23:22.418 --> 03:23:27.720
I wanted to, the principal meeting wanted all my presenters to come up and have two rows so that you could answer questions from any of them.

03:23:27.980 --> 03:23:30.461
But the logistics in me said that that wasn't going to work.

03:23:30.841 --> 03:23:32.922
So we're open for questions.

03:23:32.962 --> 03:23:34.863
You can ask any of the presenters that came before you.

03:23:35.703 --> 03:23:40.785
Before we do that, we're going to take a break and let the board members get lunch, which is out there and bring it back.

03:23:40.905 --> 03:23:43.947
So let's come back at 15 after.

03:23:49.108 --> 03:23:52.670
So the board will reconvene and we're ready for board questions.

03:23:52.730 --> 03:24:00.895
Let me start with our liaisons, member Burr and member Strauss, in terms of what you would want to say or questions you want to ask.

03:24:01.736 --> 03:24:03.337
And then we'll go around the board.

03:24:04.237 --> 03:24:09.981
Well, first, I just want to... I'm not sure people are listening.

03:24:10.481 --> 03:24:11.482
What?

03:24:13.043 --> 03:24:15.084
Oh, the board will reconvene.

03:24:17.793 --> 03:24:18.214
Thank you.

03:24:19.295 --> 03:24:23.881
First, I just want to express my appreciation to all of our presenters.

03:24:24.642 --> 03:24:32.352
I always find it very helpful to hear, especially from our on the ground folks, the county superintendents and the work that they're doing.

03:24:33.454 --> 03:24:38.538
So I think that was helpful, very illuminating about how their practice has shifted.

03:24:39.619 --> 03:24:46.846
I also really want to thank the department staff and the board staff and the collaborative staff for their efforts to pull together.

03:24:47.266 --> 03:24:50.529
And really, I also want to do a shout out to the actual item.

03:24:50.549 --> 03:24:52.311
I appreciate the PowerPoint, but

03:24:52.991 --> 03:25:02.343
The item was written, we went through several iterations, and I bless you, Melanie, for being a good listener and making the, I think, some good improvements.

03:25:02.864 --> 03:25:08.471
But fundamentally, what we're trying to do here has shifted, which is the big message I think we're trying to get here.

03:25:09.091 --> 03:25:24.041
And as I said in the earlier item, I feel like people still want to snap back to let's have a standard way, let's have a recipe, let's go into every district irrespective of whether they have six kids or 60,000 kids and tell them what to do.

03:25:24.841 --> 03:25:26.242
And that just hasn't worked.

03:25:26.783 --> 03:25:32.668
And one part of the item that I found especially helpful was the review of the research, which I think Jason mentioned.

03:25:33.348 --> 03:25:39.454
And so we've got pretty clear evidence that it doesn't work to go in and try to work at the school level.

03:25:39.734 --> 03:25:42.396
This is a preview from my comments when we get to ESSA.

03:25:43.057 --> 03:25:47.200
Does not work at the school level, not an effective way to deal with it.

03:25:48.121 --> 03:25:52.245
But so we need to really do something very different in terms of providing support.

03:25:52.605 --> 03:26:01.532
And the fact that we're having this big feedback loop and actually asking folks what would help you to improve student outcomes is brilliant.

03:26:01.632 --> 03:26:04.255
And so I'm very, very glad for that.

03:26:05.175 --> 03:26:27.210
I guess the one thing I wanted to ask, and while Socorro's up there, I will ask the question, because, you know, I am also serving on the collaborative board, so I've had a lot of up-close and personal interaction with the CCE staff, which has been fantastic, and feel like I have a more, a deeper knowledge, as does Glenn, because the department is intimately involved in this as well.

03:26:28.110 --> 03:26:36.534
about the work that is underway because in some ways where we are piloting, we use that we are working with pilot districts and with a pilot county office.

03:26:36.634 --> 03:26:43.638
Mary Barlow from Kern County gave a fantastic example of the fruition of that work.

03:26:43.938 --> 03:26:52.843
But we also have 57, I'm looking at Josh if I get the right number, professional, as Josh tries to run out of the room, professional learning networks.

03:26:53.323 --> 03:27:05.119
So we're doing some of this work already, and I just wanted to have Socorro and maybe Josh talk a little bit more specifically about that and some of the lessons that we're learning already that's being brought to this work.

03:27:06.521 --> 03:27:07.022
Thank you.

03:27:08.760 --> 03:27:16.330
Yes, so the CC, those are two major veins of the work being done with the collaborative.

03:27:16.450 --> 03:27:20.776
And both of them really start from that place of the district has to find their own answers.

03:27:20.856 --> 03:27:23.159
So, for example, with the pilots,

03:27:23.720 --> 03:27:38.668
that really is forming a relationship with them, understanding who they are, serving as organizational thought partners, and asking very probing questions, giving them the gift of time to step back and reflect on the work they're doing, the data they have.

03:27:39.648 --> 03:27:53.674
the resources they have in their district, giving them the opportunity to hear from their stakeholders, questions about what's going well, what's in the way, what should come next, and really look at that information from a different perspective.

03:27:53.714 --> 03:28:03.838
So, for example, Mary Barlow shared our work with Kern really is about they have a beautiful idea about what they want to do and it's strong and it's powerful.

03:28:04.358 --> 03:28:09.464
And we are other voices and ears in the room to say, so when you said that, what did that mean?

03:28:09.565 --> 03:28:10.506
What would that look like?

03:28:10.566 --> 03:28:19.096
And just probing them further on their own ideas so they can come to refinement that matters to them and they can learn from their own experiences.

03:28:20.037 --> 03:28:29.200
create the best experience they have for their districts and all the different types of districts that they will serve through whatever process they land themselves on.

03:28:29.500 --> 03:28:35.082
And one of the very important things with those pilot experiences is there isn't a right or wrong answer with us.

03:28:35.182 --> 03:28:42.424
So when the, and we have had many people from the district say, well, what do you want us to do?

03:28:43.065 --> 03:28:43.625
And while

03:28:44.625 --> 03:29:07.218
It could be easy to slip back into that state and say, well, clearly, you should be doing A, B, or C. The power comes in the district, the LEA themselves, seeing a way to move forward in something they all believe in, with all voices in the room, hearing and thinking about the problems they face, plus the expertise they already have.

03:29:07.298 --> 03:29:08.339
Where are their strengths?

03:29:08.419 --> 03:29:09.920
Where are their shining stars?

03:29:10.660 --> 03:29:22.391
For example, a district we're working with in the Central Valley, they have in their dashboard some definite areas of focus, but they also have some definite areas of pride.

03:29:22.891 --> 03:29:29.757
And one of the things they're doing as a result of not just working with us, so to claim that this is the CC alone really would be

03:29:30.698 --> 03:29:38.242
a shortcoming because they work closely with their own county office and they themselves are a learning and growing and improving organization.

03:29:38.362 --> 03:29:45.286
So, but one of the things they will do as a result of kind of where they are in the continuous improvement process is they're going to talk

03:29:45.666 --> 03:30:05.274
to high school teachers who are by far exceeding the rest of the district in math and really unpack what is happening in here with the union and really think about, so if these are the types of experience and resources that made this group, that allowed this group to excel, how can we create those conditions across the district?

03:30:05.894 --> 03:30:10.576
In the networks, for example, with 57 of them, they also are from the ground up.

03:30:10.656 --> 03:30:18.519
So they weren't topics that we said everybody has to talk about, but they were self-formed in areas around topics that matter to them.

03:30:19.280 --> 03:30:27.823
When we entered this work 18 months ago, one of the things we saw was that there were lots of emerging collaborative efforts and network efforts.

03:30:27.883 --> 03:30:31.365
But one of the things is that they seem to be happening in isolation.

03:30:32.345 --> 03:30:50.586
So in our framework of networks, not only are there the 57 networks, but they become networks themselves, so that those aren't individual pods of improvement, but they're amplifying and multiplying across each other, and that they're learning from each other, and that that is intentional.

03:30:50.626 --> 03:30:51.827
That's not by accident.

03:30:52.888 --> 03:31:02.800
expert people really doing a lot of that work, connecting them together, and that amplifies, again, the synergy that's possible from people solving their own problems.

03:31:02.880 --> 03:31:12.030
As you heard from others before, part of that solution-solving comes from hearing what other people are doing and not to replicate it.

03:31:12.811 --> 03:31:22.834
but to allow that to form a seed in the organization itself and be contextualized and perfected in that local context to make meaning for people.

03:31:23.415 --> 03:31:33.798
One of the things we've all experienced is that a neighbor district, for example, as a former superintendent, a neighbor district had a tremendous growth spurt with using

03:31:35.649 --> 03:31:41.575
And then you try and just plop in whatever into the district and it doesn't work because people didn't believe in it.

03:31:41.615 --> 03:31:42.916
They weren't part of the process.

03:31:43.236 --> 03:31:45.999
That actually isn't the problem you needed to solve anyway.

03:31:46.459 --> 03:31:48.961
So it really is about what our district's doing.

03:31:49.041 --> 03:31:55.527
How are the adults in that organization behaving, making decisions, making changes that matter to them.

03:31:55.688 --> 03:32:00.372
And so the work of the CCE really is giving people time to think about that, to talk about that.

03:32:00.793 --> 03:32:07.571
and connecting them in very purposeful and intentional ways to allow them to have the confidence to move forward in those decisions.

03:32:11.934 --> 03:32:13.655
So, I have several areas.

03:32:14.015 --> 03:32:16.117
I just so appreciate the full presentation.

03:32:16.157 --> 03:32:18.218
So, I just want to group several comments.

03:32:18.959 --> 03:32:26.704
First, to thank CDE and Stephanie and Deputy Superintendent Price for the reorganization of CDE and that alignment.

03:32:26.784 --> 03:32:29.946
I think there's actually some charts out in the hallway on it.

03:32:29.986 --> 03:32:33.969
And I think that really kind of shows to really rethink the resources

03:32:34.869 --> 03:32:35.669
This is a big building.

03:32:35.689 --> 03:32:38.810
There's a lot of people here and just thinking about how all the pieces work together.

03:32:38.850 --> 03:32:40.931
So, I thought that was pretty helpful.

03:32:40.951 --> 03:32:43.972
I did, I have several areas.

03:32:43.992 --> 03:32:46.493
So, let me go first to the cross-agency work.

03:32:46.613 --> 03:32:52.895
I know that WestEd and Jason and the team have been working really hard to try to bring all the different agencies together.

03:32:53.035 --> 03:32:59.137
And I know there's a timeline and that there's some things that there, but I wonder if, is Jason still in the room?

03:32:59.997 --> 03:33:07.739
Could you, I mean, is it, I have a bunch of things, but I just think that's helpful in thinking about all the different groups and what the kind of specifics.

03:33:08.599 --> 03:33:12.140
And you, I think you did talk about the nonprofits as well, if I believe.

03:33:12.300 --> 03:33:12.781
I'm not sure.

03:33:12.841 --> 03:33:23.584
But anyway, so just a few more specifics on the cross agency work and how all that is coming together and what we're likely to see as you develop this when it comes back to the board.

03:33:23.924 --> 03:33:25.004
That's my first part.

03:33:26.026 --> 03:33:27.708
So let me offer just some of the logistics.

03:33:27.728 --> 03:33:33.232
These were included in the item, but I'll kind of raise them for the sake of those tuned in today.

03:33:33.352 --> 03:33:36.774
So the cross-agency team meets on a bimonthly basis.

03:33:36.834 --> 03:33:38.996
They're basically on the off months from the state board meetings.

03:33:39.857 --> 03:33:51.785
The intention is to be able to do work in the intervening time between the state board meetings and then use this forum as an opportunity to inform both the public and the board, most specifically about the progress that we're making.

03:33:53.426 --> 03:34:01.709
As the board item describes, there are essentially two tracks that are being developed by the individuals in the collaboration.

03:34:01.729 --> 03:34:10.351
The work that's happening for 17-18, which we'll continue to talk about even as we get into implementation, and then some of the further design work.

03:34:10.371 --> 03:34:13.232
So when we basically stand up the rest of the system,

03:34:13.952 --> 03:34:32.826
in the 2018-19 year, what are some of the significant conversations that we need to have to talk about everything from how the agencies are coordinating with one another to understanding how we're raising lessons learned out of the work that they're doing with individual school districts that have been identified or ones that may be on the horizon.

03:34:33.635 --> 03:34:50.148
The other thing that I will note that I think is really important, and this is also very reflective in what we see in research and in practice and what practitioners know is really important when you're trying to make these kinds of significant change efforts, is that relationships really matter.

03:34:51.169 --> 03:34:57.874
And one of the things that this and these types of convenings have allowed is for these group of individuals who are extraordinarily busy,

03:34:58.454 --> 03:35:07.138
have a lot of very big, gnarly problems sitting in front of them to be able to take the time and space to think about this challenge collectively.

03:35:07.158 --> 03:35:13.662
And that matters a lot, I know, to both individuals in the room and to the agencies themselves as we step forward.

03:35:13.682 --> 03:35:15.622
So hopefully, Member Strauss, that addresses your question.

03:35:16.203 --> 03:35:16.723
Thanks, Jason.

03:35:22.358 --> 03:35:24.321
I'm a district in Santa Clara County.

03:35:25.403 --> 03:35:26.785
Which one of you do I pick?

03:35:27.646 --> 03:35:28.908
You know, how does it work?

03:35:28.948 --> 03:35:32.874
Do I call up WestEd or do I pick from the provider I like?

03:35:34.452 --> 03:35:42.834
or how does this, you know, I know it's coordinated, but I don't know who's doing what and how I reach out.

03:35:43.715 --> 03:35:45.115
What are the logistics of it?

03:35:45.495 --> 03:35:48.336
Yes, it's a great question, President Kirst.

03:35:49.036 --> 03:35:55.698
So, first and foremost, WestEd's kind of role in this is really just to facilitate the state agencies on the work.

03:35:55.778 --> 03:35:58.899
As one of the, I don't know if the slides are still up,

03:36:00.560 --> 03:36:08.265
But the third to last slide that we had presented some of those key questions actually addresses this directly.

03:36:08.406 --> 03:36:15.571
So in statute, there are currently, we've identified currently three pathways that LEAs kind of move into assistance.

03:36:15.971 --> 03:36:20.695
One, they're identified through the list that, you know, everyone's been discussing and talking about.

03:36:21.556 --> 03:36:30.585
Second, the county can say, you know, there's something in the LCAP that we would want to go deeper with this school district on and kind of move them into assistance in that way.

03:36:31.186 --> 03:36:39.034
Or, as the case has been with some of the work that CCE has done, the district raises their hand and says, hey, you know, we need some support.

03:36:39.555 --> 03:36:40.957
We'd like, you know, to get some help.

03:36:41.477 --> 03:36:42.998
So currently, those are the three pathways.

03:36:43.799 --> 03:36:54.768
And currently, the state agencies are working through those conversations, both in how they are thinking about coordinating their support to those districts with a primary kind of pass through the counties.

03:36:54.828 --> 03:37:05.777
But these set of questions on this slide get to your exact point, President Kurtz, which is how do we think about involving the rest of the capacity that we have in this state, which

03:37:06.998 --> 03:37:13.402
is deep and pretty vast in a way that is coordinated and is able to address the needs of districts.

03:37:13.482 --> 03:37:27.431
Because as we've, you know, had our discussions, I think it's a fair statement to say that the state agencies alone and the capacity they have is not going to be enough to make the kinds of improvements that this board and the state is aspiring to do through the LCFF.

03:37:30.086 --> 03:37:31.407
Go ahead then, I'm sorry I interrupted.

03:37:31.627 --> 03:37:40.413
So just to continue on sort of parts of this presentation, I really appreciated first Peter talking about the coordination of the counties.

03:37:40.793 --> 03:37:55.143
I actually was fortunate to attend one out at SCOE where you had all the LCFF teams from all the counties and really observed what I thought was quality professional development and norming and collaborative work across teams and with teams.

03:37:55.763 --> 03:37:57.364
So I support that continued work.

03:37:57.405 --> 03:38:07.392
As we know, all school districts aren't created equal in all counties and different sizes and shapes of distances that people have to travel to get the support.

03:38:07.432 --> 03:38:08.794
So just to support that work.

03:38:09.154 --> 03:38:13.137
And then to our three county superintendents, Ed and Dave and Mary, who came.

03:38:13.157 --> 03:38:22.604
And kind of listening to the differentiation, I pulled up the current list while Mary was talking just to look at some names of districts that are so little.

03:38:24.166 --> 03:38:26.148
and realizing capacity issues.

03:38:26.329 --> 03:38:38.062
And Socorro was sharing with me that there are capacity, there's some capacity in different places, but just thinking about scale of a district of 50 or 100 kids versus a district of 15,000 students.

03:38:39.804 --> 03:38:45.949
And so I'm interested in the lessons you're learning because people are saying, I know I'm going to be read in these areas.

03:38:46.009 --> 03:38:47.230
I know I'm going to need help.

03:38:47.631 --> 03:38:49.913
I've been a district that's had help before.

03:38:50.693 --> 03:38:52.175
How is the help looking different?

03:38:52.195 --> 03:38:55.718
And I know the global thing about differentiating, asking people what they need.

03:38:56.138 --> 03:39:11.087
But are there things where you say, look, your English learners are really struggling, or your math skills are so low that obviously your teachers need to understand some of the content, or are you finding just a breadth of opportunity to talk about all different kinds of things?

03:39:11.428 --> 03:39:18.312
I'm not sure which county it goes to, but I know Mary and Dave and Ed talked about all different ways you're trying to work with these

03:39:19.313 --> 03:39:28.906
And I think that's certainly a concern for us that we have personalized support that helps move all our subgroups forward in this arena.

03:39:29.166 --> 03:39:29.487
Thank you.

03:39:31.707 --> 03:39:33.549
If I may, I'll go ahead and start.

03:39:34.830 --> 03:39:38.414
Under our model of support, we know that there are six different major elements.

03:39:38.474 --> 03:39:39.435
Professional learning.

03:39:39.936 --> 03:39:45.021
Professional learning is all about looking at the individual needs of each district.

03:39:45.141 --> 03:39:52.089
And we are bringing them together dependent upon the students that they serve, the specific target area that they want to improve on.

03:39:52.749 --> 03:40:01.434
and then making space in their calendar and our calendar to create cohorts across districts.

03:40:01.914 --> 03:40:15.681
So we have principals, a principal learning network that might meet in the evening and on Saturday mornings, they're that committed across seven different districts because they don't have anyone else that they can meet with.

03:40:16.221 --> 03:40:17.582
within their own district.

03:40:17.842 --> 03:40:25.527
And then they're bringing that learning to their school site students, their school site teachers rather, I apologize.

03:40:26.147 --> 03:40:32.031
And so what we're doing is making that work for whatever size they are.

03:40:32.831 --> 03:40:40.438
It's not easy, and it means that we have to start with where they are in terms of their knowledge and experience.

03:40:40.939 --> 03:40:42.140
And you would be surprised.

03:40:42.220 --> 03:40:53.090
In some small districts, we have high levels of sophistication, really very well-versed, very knowledgeable, content-rich leaders, but they don't have time.

03:40:53.510 --> 03:40:54.891
And so getting a sub for them

03:40:55.652 --> 03:40:58.933
to work with them and create that space and time is important.

03:40:59.414 --> 03:41:01.194
So that's one thing.

03:41:01.734 --> 03:41:06.356
So as you can see, we have networks, the job-alike networks that I listed.

03:41:07.217 --> 03:41:08.637
It goes across a variety.

03:41:08.677 --> 03:41:14.940
It's superintendents, CBOs, principals, learning coaches, English language learner networks,

03:41:17.001 --> 03:41:27.306
and others, particularly MTSS and PBIS, and those learning communities meet on a monthly basis and that's where the embedded support takes place.

03:41:27.887 --> 03:41:39.373
We also, during our lunch periods, because we have the monthly meetings, show promising practices from districts, large or small, and then they can learn from one another and we support

03:41:39.893 --> 03:41:51.118
getting substitutes so that those teachers of that particular school site can go visit another school site and see it's a program in operation.

03:41:51.879 --> 03:41:53.139
Those are just a couple examples.

03:41:56.221 --> 03:41:57.001
Board member Rucker.

03:41:58.082 --> 03:42:00.263
Oh, we're still answering.

03:42:05.225 --> 03:42:06.826
I think Mary did a fabulous job.

03:42:10.509 --> 03:42:15.811
By the way, Ed also serves as a leader at CPAG, so I just thought the board should know that.

03:42:16.511 --> 03:42:18.372
I'll go ahead and touch on one item.

03:42:18.472 --> 03:42:29.257
You know, I think that when you're speaking to the example of a math teacher may be struggling in a very small district, for example, Indian Diggings in our county has less than 20 students in that school.

03:42:29.677 --> 03:42:31.818
The collaborative network that we've developed

03:42:32.518 --> 03:42:43.486
has been the mechanism for small districts to be able to meet regularly on these problems of practice, specifically math, as I highlighted in my presentation.

03:42:43.566 --> 03:42:52.312
But in that network, it provides an opportunity for our county office to even partner with other individuals that have been focusing on math.

03:42:52.372 --> 03:42:56.915
So, for example, Pivot Learning has been working with us in this specific area of math.

03:42:57.495 --> 03:43:00.337
In our meeting last week, we brought an individual who's been

03:43:01.778 --> 03:43:11.807
you know, a master teacher in respect to math and the work that they've been doing with CORE and what they've been learning from those districts, they brought that right into our learning network.

03:43:12.207 --> 03:43:16.871
So these small districts are tapped into the learning that's taking place throughout the state.

03:43:20.374 --> 03:43:22.516
My small districts are large compared to theirs.

03:43:35.799 --> 03:43:35.979
All right.

03:43:36.059 --> 03:43:42.263
So I want to thank everybody who worked together to put this particular item together.

03:43:42.543 --> 03:43:44.725
And I want to begin with a comment.

03:43:45.025 --> 03:43:46.886
And then I do have some questions.

03:43:46.966 --> 03:43:54.070
And in asking the questions, I'll be honest with you, I'm not really sure who it is that the question should be directed to.

03:43:54.471 --> 03:43:57.773
So I'm going to suggest if you know the answer, just come on up.

03:43:59.213 --> 03:44:02.035
I knew I should have them in just in two rows right here.

03:44:02.175 --> 03:44:02.675
I knew it.

03:44:03.475 --> 03:44:10.518
And similar to board member Strauss, I have many, many, many, many, many questions.

03:44:10.979 --> 03:44:15.801
And I would have liked to have asked them after each successive panel of presenters.

03:44:16.181 --> 03:44:23.124
So I'm going to condense or at least attempt to condense the questions down to talk a little bit about

03:44:24.124 --> 03:44:24.885
process.

03:44:25.285 --> 03:44:30.667
And I want to begin just, I heard a lot of quotes from school change gurus.

03:44:31.307 --> 03:44:38.631
I want to give another, I want to offer another quote to this conversation because it's going to frame what my questions are about.

03:44:39.071 --> 03:44:45.814
But I'm borrowing not from a school change guru, I'm borrowing from an agitation guru named Frederick Douglass.

03:44:46.754 --> 03:44:50.936
Frederick Douglass said struggle doesn't, progress doesn't happen without struggle.

03:44:51.836 --> 03:45:00.402
And those who would like to see progress without dealing with agitation want to get crops without plowing the field.

03:45:00.842 --> 03:45:03.464
They would like to have the rain without thunder and lightning.

03:45:03.824 --> 03:45:07.726
They'd like to see the ocean without having to hear the roar of the waters.

03:45:09.708 --> 03:45:12.990
I'm glad to hear all of the work that's being done.

03:45:13.450 --> 03:45:16.892
I'm glad to hear all of the schema that's in place.

03:45:17.313 --> 03:45:18.834
But what I didn't hear

03:45:19.807 --> 03:45:21.810
is what are you struggling with?

03:45:22.430 --> 03:45:25.053
This is a significant sea change.

03:45:25.594 --> 03:45:28.017
And on Monday, we behaved one way.

03:45:28.618 --> 03:45:31.781
On Tuesday, we are now behaving in a different way.

03:45:32.342 --> 03:45:36.787
That did not happen without some struggle or some conflict.

03:45:37.228 --> 03:45:39.591
So while I did hear from one

03:45:41.012 --> 03:45:43.273
county, here's what we're learning.

03:45:43.773 --> 03:45:48.955
I did not get a clear understanding what those learnings were based on.

03:45:49.536 --> 03:45:59.841
And so there's 58 counties in the state and I live in a county where I didn't hear that that's not that was represented by none of the people who presented today.

03:46:00.321 --> 03:46:05.584
So I'm apparently going to the wrong meetings because none of the models of practice

03:46:06.024 --> 03:46:12.887
and none of the good things that are happening is being practiced or apparent in the meetings I'm going to.

03:46:13.367 --> 03:46:21.730
But further, the stakeholders who spoke to this board on a previous item, their head is someplace else.

03:46:22.230 --> 03:46:31.534
Their head in particular is about how the districts are being held accountable for the decisions they are making that seem to be invisible.

03:46:32.526 --> 03:46:40.411
particularly as it relates to school climate, or as it relates to the decisions they make about the non-state level indicators.

03:46:40.771 --> 03:46:43.232
Those things seem to be invisible to them.

03:46:43.692 --> 03:46:57.961
So there's clearly still a struggle about how to do this work, and that struggle is that, the struggle is the difference between the form of the interventions we heard about and the multiple ways and pathways that are being articulated,

03:46:58.681 --> 03:47:08.290
I have to congratulate every agency, both the department and the county offices, for the work that they have done to put together the infrastructure to do this.

03:47:08.570 --> 03:47:09.491
That's the form.

03:47:10.032 --> 03:47:17.399
But what I was disappointed in, and I am using the word disappointed on purpose, is I didn't really hear enough about the function.

03:47:17.819 --> 03:47:21.802
I'm glad to hear how superintendents are working together.

03:47:22.162 --> 03:47:34.049
But what I keep hearing and what I consistently hear at every board meeting is in some way that collaboration is not trickling down in a meaningful way to stakeholders.

03:47:34.510 --> 03:47:37.592
And so I have a series of questions to think about.

03:47:37.872 --> 03:47:45.757
And it really is about the function and the agency that these interventions are going to be are going to be implemented with.

03:47:46.690 --> 03:47:56.314
When districts make the decision that some intervention or support is required, what is the basis of that decision?

03:47:56.695 --> 03:47:58.776
How are stakeholders involved?

03:47:59.096 --> 03:48:02.477
And how is consensus developed or arrived at?

03:48:02.877 --> 03:48:14.723
Because there's a clear difference between what I'm hearing from superintendents in these presentations for this item and what stakeholders continue to come and say and complain about.

03:48:16.905 --> 03:48:26.009
As county offices are doing this work, one of the things that I didn't hear them talking about from any of these presentations is their own sense of agency.

03:48:26.049 --> 03:48:29.570
There's a lot of overlapping work that potentially can happen.

03:48:30.010 --> 03:48:35.412
And in doing this work, are they doing it as an agent of the state to do the intervention with the school?

03:48:35.913 --> 03:48:44.416
Or are they clear that they're trying to do this because it's part of what they view as their evolving role as a county office?

03:48:44.736 --> 03:48:46.558
That's not clearly spelled out.

03:48:47.339 --> 03:48:49.041
What is their exit strategy?

03:48:49.481 --> 03:48:54.366
And how are, what are the flags they're going to use to evaluate their work along the way?

03:48:54.807 --> 03:49:06.680
Because I think capacity issues, funding, and budgeting for this activity, I heard only from one agent from CCESA that they're monitoring capacity and funding for this.

03:49:07.000 --> 03:49:13.724
because we really don't know how different this is to think through that capacity and to think through how to fund it.

03:49:14.184 --> 03:49:27.012
And are we tasking county offices to do things that we fairly haven't given them the capacity both in terms of human capacity as well as funding and resources to make sure they're doing that work.

03:49:27.153 --> 03:49:31.755
I didn't hear any county office talking to us about that and they should have.

03:49:31.815 --> 03:49:33.957
This was their opportunity to do that today.

03:49:34.617 --> 03:49:38.761
And probably because you didn't know I was going to ask that, you probably couldn't tell them to do that.

03:49:40.763 --> 03:50:00.881
But I want to make sure that they are having those conversations because without being mindful of those conversations, we're going to be surprised when these grand schema suddenly stop working or when they leave the school, they stop working because the capacity to continue the work was not sustained.

03:50:02.110 --> 03:50:09.155
The other question that I have is more related to, again, the sense of agency among the stakeholder groups.

03:50:09.575 --> 03:50:27.868
How are the practitioners, the educators in the classrooms who are carrying out this work and these grand plans and doing this implementing, how are they benefiting from all these multiple meetings and what is the plan for making sure they're just simply not going to meeting, to meeting, to meeting, to meeting

03:50:28.248 --> 03:50:35.992
without actually having the opportunity to decide how to parse out what is useful and what is no longer necessary.

03:50:36.092 --> 03:50:39.174
What is the evaluation schema for doing that?

03:50:39.534 --> 03:50:48.899
I heard nothing about the different levels of evaluation, the different levels of how they are holding themselves internally accountable for the work that they are doing.

03:50:49.239 --> 03:50:51.020
I hear them talking about checking in,

03:50:51.420 --> 03:50:55.223
But checking in is not the same thing as being accountable.

03:50:55.624 --> 03:51:06.733
So while it's safe for me to assume that that's being done, if I don't hear about it, it's also safe for me to assume maybe they haven't thought that through.

03:51:07.314 --> 03:51:10.757
And then the last comment or question that I'm going to add to this is,

03:51:12.243 --> 03:51:16.628
While it's good, you come to a public forum like this, it's being carried out on the internet.

03:51:17.129 --> 03:51:20.192
The temptation is to always talk about the good news.

03:51:20.752 --> 03:51:25.557
But I think it is important to talk about where the mistakes are, what the struggles were.

03:51:26.038 --> 03:51:27.880
Because when you don't do that,

03:51:28.320 --> 03:51:41.634
The people who are in your counties or the people who are in your school, the other stakeholders who are sitting there listening to you, they are going to feel like, well, I must have missed that meeting because that's not my experience.

03:51:41.654 --> 03:51:44.797
And I'm saying that because, again, I live in a county.

03:51:45.337 --> 03:51:49.262
not among any of those that did a presentation today.

03:51:49.642 --> 03:52:01.256
And I have gone to multiple meetings and none of the modeling and none of the activities and interaction and collaboration and spirit of cooperation and engagement is apparent in those meetings.

03:52:01.696 --> 03:52:19.133
And so I think it is important to talk about what still needs to be done or deal with the fact that people still don't trust that this process really is a shift to continuous learning because we still have folks in reality who are still waiting for the other shoe to drop.

03:52:19.493 --> 03:52:25.639
They still keep looking above their head to see if the sword of Damocles is hanging up there or if it's been placed there yet.

03:52:26.660 --> 03:52:37.586
And so I think it's important to talk about those struggles, to talk about those hard conversations, or even to highlight what you know the hard conversations are going to be.

03:52:38.127 --> 03:52:45.151
Because again, not hearing what those hard conversations are, either you didn't have them or you don't know what they are.

03:52:45.531 --> 03:52:46.912
And that concerns me.

03:52:47.332 --> 03:52:51.234
The reason why I'm concerned about all those things goes back to the comment I made earlier.

03:52:51.635 --> 03:53:04.082
People still have the impression this is, we have, we're implementing some loosey-goosey process where we're going to get into rooms, contemplate our navel and have a good conversation, get up and leave feeling good because we're collaborating.

03:53:04.383 --> 03:53:08.605
But we have not held our excels accountable to make sure change happens.

03:53:09.005 --> 03:53:11.027
I want to remind everybody

03:53:12.009 --> 03:53:15.211
Schools are failing some students.

03:53:16.051 --> 03:53:19.033
They are being successful with other students.

03:53:19.953 --> 03:53:37.802
It is going to be possible that we will continue to fail the students we have always failed if we do not take time to identify what the hard conversations are, what makes them a hard conversation, and what we did to have those.

03:53:38.143 --> 03:53:40.844
And I think when you have successive panels coming,

03:53:41.284 --> 03:53:44.606
For me, it would be really important to hear those things.

03:53:45.666 --> 03:53:46.407
That's very helpful.

03:53:46.467 --> 03:53:47.767
And we'll make sure that we fold that in.

03:53:48.127 --> 03:53:57.492
But what I also heard you say, not only just individual counties, but also overall, what's the coordinated approach so that just because you live in one county, you're not getting something different from others.

03:53:57.552 --> 03:53:58.612
So I appreciate that feedback.

03:53:58.672 --> 03:54:02.874
And I'll make sure when we come back in November, we have that as part of our discussion.

03:54:03.695 --> 03:54:04.055
Thank you.

03:54:08.737 --> 03:54:16.782
I'd like to continue the comments that Member Rucker made in that there is something.

03:54:16.802 --> 03:54:20.805
Well, first of all, thank you to the presenters.

03:54:21.205 --> 03:54:21.825
Excellent job.

03:54:21.885 --> 03:54:25.728
Really appreciate everything you're doing for the kids and everything you're doing for the state.

03:54:27.247 --> 03:54:33.293
There's something very human about this process, though, that is hugely important to face and to talk about.

03:54:33.493 --> 03:54:40.900
And we got a glimpse of that, I think, most clearly in the comments from the superintendent from El Dorado.

03:54:42.501 --> 03:54:49.728
We have created the system where now we can pinpoint the fact that Billy can't, in the 10th grade, add fractions.

03:54:50.889 --> 03:54:51.610
That's great.

03:54:51.710 --> 03:54:53.011
That's a wonderful starting point.

03:54:55.768 --> 03:54:58.029
But the question is, why?

03:54:58.789 --> 03:54:59.750
What's the cause?

03:55:00.910 --> 03:55:08.773
And we don't like that word cause, because in almost every educator's mind, parent's mind, kid's mind, it's blame.

03:55:09.614 --> 03:55:10.474
Who's to blame?

03:55:10.494 --> 03:55:17.677
You know, we can blame Hurricane Irma, and we can blame wildfires, and those are easier to blame.

03:55:18.678 --> 03:55:20.478
And no human is the problem.

03:55:21.639 --> 03:55:23.440
But in schools,

03:55:24.935 --> 03:55:32.740
In family lives, in the process of educating young people, what happens is a result of what people do.

03:55:34.701 --> 03:55:35.802
Is a parent to blame?

03:55:36.602 --> 03:55:37.663
Is the child to blame?

03:55:37.843 --> 03:55:38.864
Is the teacher to blame?

03:55:39.044 --> 03:55:40.485
Is the district to blame?

03:55:40.665 --> 03:55:42.106
Is on and on and on and on.

03:55:44.107 --> 03:55:52.112
Understanding that in order for this system to work, there has to be, as the superintendent said,

03:55:54.562 --> 03:56:08.250
a safe zone where admitting weakness, admitting problems, admitting cause is the seed where change can really happen.

03:56:08.370 --> 03:56:10.131
And without that really human

03:56:10.899 --> 03:56:14.901
beginning point with each individual, it doesn't work.

03:56:15.141 --> 03:56:25.005
You can have system upon system upon system and layer upon layer and this pathway and that pathway, but if I sit there as a teacher feeling I'm being blamed,

03:56:27.415 --> 03:56:35.237
It doesn't, and I'm not willing to share my weakness, to share my fault, to share what I don't know.

03:56:36.017 --> 03:56:36.557
It doesn't work.

03:56:37.277 --> 03:56:40.938
School climate is critical to the success of children.

03:56:42.698 --> 03:56:54.221
Teacher climate, district climate, adult climate, family and school together climate, adult climate.

03:56:55.231 --> 03:56:56.671
That has to be a safe zone.

03:56:57.152 --> 03:57:09.695
So to me, the most positive thing I heard today was when the superintendent of El Dorado said that his district superintendents, I believe, have thanked him for creating a safe space where they could speak honestly about that.

03:57:10.015 --> 03:57:11.515
To me, that's the elephant in the room.

03:57:11.855 --> 03:57:13.216
To me, that's the starting point.

03:57:13.836 --> 03:57:16.577
And I'm sorry, it doesn't have a whole lot to do with policy.

03:57:18.437 --> 03:57:21.378
It has to do with something I think is more important.

03:57:27.634 --> 03:57:28.535
Oh, Board Member Sun.

03:57:28.696 --> 03:57:29.056
Thank you.

03:57:30.638 --> 03:57:35.165
So I really appreciate the County Superintendents who came up here and presented today.

03:57:35.185 --> 03:57:44.157
I happen to spend my career in Sacramento County and Sacramento County has always provided great regional support.

03:57:45.599 --> 03:57:53.873
And now hearing this collaboration across different counties and agencies is really inspiring.

03:57:54.514 --> 03:57:58.200
So I do have a little bit of a different perspective from this.

03:58:01.377 --> 03:58:08.404
So first, I've been involved in a lot of startups, startup organizations, startup schools, startup initiatives.

03:58:08.944 --> 03:58:11.887
And there's always a pattern that occurs with startups.

03:58:12.468 --> 03:58:15.010
First year, you're enthusiastic.

03:58:15.050 --> 03:58:15.871
We're all in it.

03:58:15.911 --> 03:58:16.992
We got the vision.

03:58:17.353 --> 03:58:18.554
We're moving forward.

03:58:19.034 --> 03:58:22.397
And then two, three, and four, it starts getting hard.

03:58:23.158 --> 03:58:29.645
Because it's complicated and it's a lot of hard work and what you originally envisioned may not be quite there.

03:58:30.265 --> 03:58:33.869
And so it's very easy by year four to get disillusioned.

03:58:35.004 --> 03:58:37.665
and feel that, why did we get this?

03:58:38.266 --> 03:58:39.206
Is this really going to work?

03:58:39.426 --> 03:58:40.307
And question.

03:58:41.007 --> 03:58:42.448
And that's not a bad thing.

03:58:42.668 --> 03:58:48.511
That's not a bad thing to question and say, hey, what we started out with, is this really the right way?

03:58:48.591 --> 03:58:57.495
So I think the pattern that I've seen over and over again is I'm seeing is occurring with our new accountability system.

03:58:59.554 --> 03:59:07.163
I can tell you from my experience in a fairly high-performing school, it's changing conversations in my school.

03:59:08.360 --> 03:59:20.210
The new system, I now work with my, I think I may have mentioned this before, I now work with my CFO so much more closely in the development of MyGalCap.

03:59:20.951 --> 03:59:25.455
It changes the conversation, it changes her perspective of what we do in our school.

03:59:26.015 --> 03:59:30.299
So that collaboration there, it changes conversations around

03:59:31.440 --> 03:59:39.866
We may have a certain status, but really, are we okay with that or do we need to look at whether we want to grow more or not?

03:59:40.787 --> 03:59:43.048
We look at other points of data.

03:59:43.309 --> 03:59:52.315
How do we look at different types of data to be able to tell a better story as board member Valdez talked about?

03:59:53.115 --> 03:59:58.920
And how do we get to what the bad parts of our story is and how do we fix that?

03:59:59.620 --> 04:00:05.202
So I know from my own experience, it changes conversations within my school.

04:00:05.782 --> 04:00:16.245
And I also know that conversations that are happening regionally through some of the collaboratives through the county work, it's also changing conversations at that level too.

04:00:17.205 --> 04:00:17.365
Now,

04:00:22.848 --> 04:00:32.917
I think that when we become, get to a certain point in the change process, we become disillusioned and we forget that there was some momentum.

04:00:33.517 --> 04:00:48.310
And what I saw today was not just my own experience, those conversations changing, but from the perspectives of those county superintendents who came up and spoke around the stories of their counties and the work that they're doing with their schools.

04:00:49.131 --> 04:01:04.574
So while I appreciate Board Member Rucker's sense of urgency, and I think we need to continue pushing that sense of urgency, the fact that we have folks coming together and having those conversations, the urgency is, OK, when do we stop having the conversation?

04:01:04.654 --> 04:01:05.954
We actually do something about it.

04:01:06.354 --> 04:01:09.075
And that is the continued work we need to have.

04:01:09.635 --> 04:01:13.136
So the reflection, the doubt, some of these things that we're feeling,

04:01:14.136 --> 04:01:17.137
I'm okay with, but it doesn't mean we stop.

04:01:17.177 --> 04:01:21.497
And in order for us to get to the next level, we need to address those and move forward.

04:01:21.857 --> 04:01:27.598
And truly be reflective and honest with ourselves.

04:01:27.718 --> 04:01:34.300
So... Board member Burr.

04:01:39.001 --> 04:01:39.381
Okay.

04:01:39.441 --> 04:01:40.681
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

04:01:40.701 --> 04:01:41.141
Okay.

04:01:42.105 --> 04:01:43.767
I also want to thank the presenters.

04:01:43.827 --> 04:01:47.251
Thank you for sharing some of the best practices in your respective districts.

04:01:47.591 --> 04:02:02.367
And I think that it is important for us to understand that there are some models of collaboration, because even though, you know, I also have that sense of urgency where we need to get it back to what board member Rucker once referred to the unit of analysis being the student and at that level.

04:02:03.488 --> 04:02:06.491
We also need to understand that not everyone knows how to collaborate.

04:02:06.711 --> 04:02:08.272
Not everyone knows how to do that.

04:02:08.733 --> 04:02:11.455
And that people are still very much in silo mentality.

04:02:11.555 --> 04:02:18.721
And so the fact that you were able to break out of that silo mentality and actually establish networks, that's a huge step forward.

04:02:18.981 --> 04:02:23.445
And I think we need that in order to effectively sustain any change.

04:02:24.166 --> 04:02:28.910
I came from a school district where I was only there for three years.

04:02:29.010 --> 04:02:31.412
It's a large urban school district in Southern California.

04:02:32.439 --> 04:02:36.680
And I realize that the bureaucracy is very resilient.

04:02:37.260 --> 04:02:45.622
And even when you have good intentions, great models on paper, it doesn't trickle down and it's a lot of work.

04:02:46.502 --> 04:02:50.923
So I do think that we need to learn about what are the hard conversations.

04:02:51.423 --> 04:02:54.704
The beauty of organizations is that they're comprised of people.

04:02:55.384 --> 04:02:58.485
The challenge of organizations is that they're comprised of people.

04:02:59.225 --> 04:03:04.288
And some of the work could be as simple as, hey, we didn't know how to analyze data, but now we know.

04:03:04.708 --> 04:03:07.750
And we know that we have issues with our English learners.

04:03:07.950 --> 04:03:12.853
And we know that we're not properly serving our African-American students, our Latino students, or these achievement gaps.

04:03:13.133 --> 04:03:14.214
And we're going to monitor them.

04:03:14.254 --> 04:03:18.817
And we're going to show you how we narrow them after we did this network collaborative work.

04:03:19.741 --> 04:03:24.422
But there's other issues where you have hardened mindsets that are not shifting.

04:03:25.142 --> 04:03:33.585
And that is the root of the problem that it is a hard conversation to have when you have people that simply do not believe that the students in front of them can learn.

04:03:34.385 --> 04:03:36.386
And they will always focus on the deficit.

04:03:36.906 --> 04:03:38.606
That's a hard conversation to have.

04:03:38.866 --> 04:03:44.228
And I think that it's a conversation that few want to engage in because then you have to start interrogating systems of

04:03:45.248 --> 04:03:46.589
you know, different institutional systems.

04:03:48.130 --> 04:03:56.416
So I would like to see examples of those hard conversations, just like mentioned by Board Member Rucker, and then more quantitative data.

04:03:56.576 --> 04:03:58.857
So we push through it and look at the outcome.

04:03:59.297 --> 04:04:02.359
And I know that there is great examples, great networks.

04:04:02.400 --> 04:04:04.721
The core districts have been referenced here.

04:04:04.801 --> 04:04:06.062
They've done some great work.

04:04:06.782 --> 04:04:08.063
I would like to see more of that.

04:04:08.243 --> 04:04:14.848
I would like to hear conversations about districts that had blind spots, that didn't realize that they were not properly serving some groups.

04:04:15.648 --> 04:04:22.631
In the item, I didn't see a lot about achievement gaps as being one of the areas of focus or cultural competence as being one of their interventions.

04:04:23.071 --> 04:04:26.353
So I would like us to really see this through a more broad perspective.

04:04:26.693 --> 04:04:29.094
It's not just ELA or math.

04:04:29.294 --> 04:04:34.156
It's the student subgroups that comprise or that are underperforming in those subject areas.

04:04:34.597 --> 04:04:36.717
So that's what I would like to see moving forward.

04:04:37.278 --> 04:04:37.558
Thank you.

04:04:41.747 --> 04:04:46.614
So I actually had my hand up because I wanted to answer your question about Santa Clara County.

04:04:46.914 --> 04:04:55.686
Yeah, but it goes Yeah, it goes exactly to also the the concern that board member Ortiz Lincoln just raised and that is

04:04:56.847 --> 04:05:01.852
I want to see this in the context of time.

04:05:02.292 --> 04:05:14.022
What we heard about today were all of these agencies preparing for reality, and reality starts in November when Cindy releases the dashboard, right?

04:05:14.162 --> 04:05:15.363
Because we remember...

04:05:16.568 --> 04:05:26.153
Remember that what we've been doing up till now, and going back to Board Member Sun's comments, we've been building this new airplane.

04:05:26.753 --> 04:05:28.855
And now we're ready to fly, right?

04:05:28.895 --> 04:05:30.716
Because now we've got the indicators.

04:05:31.136 --> 04:05:34.778
Now we've got the criteria by which people get identified.

04:05:35.178 --> 04:05:40.701
And at the core of that criteria, and this answers your question, President Kirst,

04:05:41.241 --> 04:05:49.724
In the item, and it's on page three of the item, everything is based on student group performance.

04:05:50.364 --> 04:05:53.846
That's where we differ from ESSA, importantly.

04:05:54.226 --> 04:06:02.429
And we say if an LEA is failing one student subgroup, the counties are required to provide assistance.

04:06:03.009 --> 04:06:08.411
So if you're that district in Santa Clara County, and you've got a subgroup or student group that's not performing,

04:06:09.051 --> 04:06:15.174
you're going to hear from John Gundry, the superintendent of Santa Clara County, who's going to be there to provide assistance.

04:06:15.594 --> 04:06:25.699
And to me, what we saw here were really shining examples of counties gearing up to do that based on what they've been doing in their LCAP reviews, etc.

04:06:26.120 --> 04:06:32.823
But knowing that this day was coming when the statute was actually going to kick in and say what has to happen.

04:06:33.444 --> 04:06:37.930
and that the spotlight must shine on every student group performance.

04:06:38.351 --> 04:06:44.720
So I want to make sure that didn't get lost there because it does sound like it's a lot of relationship building.

04:06:45.040 --> 04:06:48.666
It's a lot of trying to figure out how to work with each other, but there's really

04:06:49.927 --> 04:06:53.128
force behind it because of the statute and what the statute says.

04:06:53.468 --> 04:07:14.414
And as long as those student groups are not performing to where they're expected to and what the levels at which we've approved, there will continue to be ramped up assistance, ultimately leading to, if there's more than three subgroups, the superintendent coming in and could ultimately, the superintendent of public instruction, come in and ultimately put a trustee there.

04:07:14.534 --> 04:07:18.955
So that while all of this, the capacity building, which is kind of an overused term,

04:07:19.535 --> 04:07:31.560
But creating the networks, creating the collaborative processes are leading up to that so that you can have these very difficult conversations that I know have already started and talking to people who are in LEAs.

04:07:32.220 --> 04:07:34.381
But this fall, it's real, right?

04:07:34.441 --> 04:07:35.701
Because the data is real.

04:07:35.821 --> 04:07:36.642
It's up to date.

04:07:36.962 --> 04:07:42.464
We will know where those gaps are and those tough conversations about

04:07:43.605 --> 04:07:50.255
what are our challenges and who's responsible for improving what happens with students will occur.

04:07:50.275 --> 04:07:59.328
So I just want to make sure, I think we kind of lost the timeline here a little bit, but I also lost the focus on student groups, but that is at the core of this system.

04:07:59.827 --> 04:08:03.669
Yeah, let me just, since you answered the question partially, let me make it more complex.

04:08:03.749 --> 04:08:13.273
Let's say that I want to, rather than the county, I would like to have the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence come in.

04:08:14.253 --> 04:08:16.634
It seems to me I have that right.

04:08:16.654 --> 04:08:18.235
So that's one of my questions.

04:08:19.155 --> 04:08:21.116
And are they ready to respond?

04:08:21.136 --> 04:08:27.399
Is CCE ready to respond to every potential district that might ask them to come in?

04:08:28.379 --> 04:08:29.980
Yes, so you definitely have that right.

04:08:30.340 --> 04:08:38.262
And that's actually how we got the 10 pilot school districts because they raised their hand and the 57 networks who said, hey, we want to try this out.

04:08:38.302 --> 04:08:39.483
We think it will be helpful.

04:08:40.323 --> 04:08:46.885
The short version about CCEE is we have to make a request for funding for long term funding to determine

04:08:47.245 --> 04:08:49.467
what CCE looks like when it grows up.

04:08:49.587 --> 04:08:54.311
And part of the work we've been doing to date is to figure out what the scope of that is.

04:08:55.172 --> 04:08:59.016
But under any circumstance, you will get help from the county superintendent.

04:08:59.096 --> 04:09:08.945
You can go beyond that and LEAs have all kinds of authority if they want to work with a non-profit, if they want to work with one of their associations.

04:09:09.845 --> 04:09:11.307
Many of our networks are

04:09:11.767 --> 04:09:16.632
associations, CTA, ACSA, CSBA, all have networks working now.

04:09:17.092 --> 04:09:24.640
So there's, I think, a very broad variety of entities with whom you can work if you choose to as an LEA.

04:09:25.861 --> 04:09:29.244
Yeah, I just wanted to expand before we go on your comment that

04:09:30.720 --> 04:09:34.423
I don't think everybody memorizes LCFF like the two of us.

04:09:34.503 --> 04:09:47.934
So in Education Code 52072, it says the superintendent may, with the approval of the State Board, identify school districts in need of intervention.

04:09:48.715 --> 04:09:59.962
And that would be one of the ways that would trigger that if the school district did not improve the outcomes for three or more pupil subgroups identified pursuant to this section.

04:10:01.203 --> 04:10:15.011
And if the school district has less than three pupil subgroups, all of the school district's pupil subgroups in regard to more than one state or local priority in three out of four consecutive years.

04:10:15.592 --> 04:10:17.153
So it's subgroup based.

04:10:17.993 --> 04:10:22.058
And it has a timeline for the school districts identified.

04:10:22.459 --> 04:10:27.485
The superintendent may, with the approval of the state board, do one or more of the following.

04:10:28.106 --> 04:10:32.892
Make changes to local control and accountability plan adopted by the governing board.

04:10:33.607 --> 04:10:39.949
develop and impose a budget revision in conjunction with the revisions to the local control and accountability plan.

04:10:40.789 --> 04:10:47.510
Stay or rescind an action of that school district because that action is not required by a local collective bargaining agreement.

04:10:47.930 --> 04:10:57.813
And lastly, appoint an academic trustee to exercise the powers and authority specified in this section on his or her behalf.

04:10:58.945 --> 04:11:00.967
Now, so that is our law.

04:11:01.167 --> 04:11:06.212
And, you know, that, so there is some endgame here as well.

04:11:06.432 --> 04:11:16.042
And so, in a lot of the dialogue as well about the ESSA plan, it seems to me people don't know there's a state law here.

04:11:17.103 --> 04:11:22.568
It is operative and we don't have to wait for Washington to do something.

04:11:23.726 --> 04:11:30.931
And our intervention, or not our intervention, but our assistance is coming in school year 2017-2018.

04:11:30.951 --> 04:11:33.993
The ESSA law has a much longer string and it goes in 2020-2021.

04:11:40.837 --> 04:11:44.602
I would hope by the time that law kicks in, we have a whole lot of experience.

04:11:46.244 --> 04:11:53.332
And so that experience will not be revealed in this state plan, which we will take up next time.

04:11:54.013 --> 04:11:54.774
So who's next?

04:11:55.315 --> 04:11:55.475
Karen.

04:12:00.878 --> 04:12:01.899
And thank you so much.

04:12:01.959 --> 04:12:05.101
And I just really, really appreciate the district or the county stories.

04:12:05.161 --> 04:12:10.906
And it's really giving us a strong framework of experiences that are very, very positive.

04:12:11.006 --> 04:12:14.708
I agree that it's hard to come out and say, I failed at this.

04:12:14.768 --> 04:12:16.930
I want to talk to you on my radio about it.

04:12:17.350 --> 04:12:29.319
But with this whole thing, as we're looking at it, it seems like the state intervention right now, if you're talking about intervention from the LCFF perspective, has more to do with the capacity building model.

04:12:29.739 --> 04:12:39.048
And when you look at capacity and you look at Fullen's research in his recent report and thinking about capacity in order to do that, it takes capacity to build capacity.

04:12:39.209 --> 04:12:41.611
And we have to look at are all entities ready.

04:12:41.671 --> 04:12:46.376
So CCESS's work in helping county offices to calibrate themselves and to build that capacity.

04:12:46.876 --> 04:13:03.844
But when you look at, I think there's not a recipe for this, I agree with Sue, but I think there are some fundamental pieces that have to be part of this, whatever this intervention looks like when they're coming forward, whoever's going to be doing it, and if it's interrelated, and looking at, again, I'm going to use Fullen's four drivers.

04:13:04.185 --> 04:13:12.209
So if those things are in place, and we heard examples of those today, like setting goals with what Sacramento has about learning, all children learning,

04:13:13.129 --> 04:13:17.575
We look at collaborative teams and I have been part of the early implementer.

04:13:18.175 --> 04:13:22.220
It's called EAPLAN last year with the professional learning networks.

04:13:22.281 --> 04:13:26.346
And then this year we're part of another professional learning network in Riverside County.

04:13:26.706 --> 04:13:29.690
There's a lot of power in looking at that problem of practice.

04:13:30.951 --> 04:13:32.953
Coinciding with that, that's the collaborative teams.

04:13:32.973 --> 04:13:34.154
You've got to deepen the learning.

04:13:34.194 --> 04:13:36.196
And so there are constructs that have to happen.

04:13:36.216 --> 04:13:38.658
And then finally, you're going to look at that accountability.

04:13:38.678 --> 04:13:44.484
And I think what we're ultimately asking for is internal accountability balanced with the external accountability.

04:13:44.984 --> 04:13:47.706
The challenge is going to be, again, how that looks in

04:13:49.924 --> 04:13:53.247
when you're calling for intervention, what are you calling for intervention for?

04:13:53.307 --> 04:13:58.491
I mean, the color's there, but how do you go about providing that?

04:13:58.551 --> 04:13:59.492
What does it look like?

04:13:59.932 --> 04:14:06.458
So I think we need a little bit clearer direction on that, even though it needs to be open-ended, because it needs to be customized, if that makes sense.

04:14:06.818 --> 04:14:10.861
So I think that's one of the things, that we just want to have more clarity, and it's all becoming clearer.

04:14:11.342 --> 04:14:14.284
It's just going to get better over time, but that needs to be addressed.

04:14:14.945 --> 04:14:15.185
Thank you.

04:14:18.169 --> 04:14:22.188
Okay, Board Member Rucker.

04:14:24.252 --> 04:14:27.574
Okay, I do want to say just to make sure I wasn't misunderstood.

04:14:29.114 --> 04:14:37.678
I'm not saying that the work that they are doing is not important or that I think that they're forgetting something.

04:14:37.698 --> 04:14:47.563
What I am saying is the work, the important work that they are doing is not inclusive of all the stakeholders they need to be speaking with, or at least that's not what I heard.

04:14:48.223 --> 04:14:57.167
And so again, to quote somebody else named Richard Elmore, if it isn't in the core and it's not apparent that's the work you're doing, you're not doing it.

04:14:57.627 --> 04:15:07.552
So I did not, while the comment was made that they are at the beginning, what I heard is this is what we're already doing, not what we're gonna do.

04:15:07.932 --> 04:15:10.533
I'm from the South and gonna is an important word.

04:15:11.133 --> 04:15:15.716
Gonna means, I'm not doing that right now, but I'm thinking about it.

04:15:16.317 --> 04:15:21.100
I didn't hear them say, and that's also Ebonics for those of you who are not aware.

04:15:21.661 --> 04:15:24.463
So I didn't hear them say, we're gonna do this.

04:15:25.003 --> 04:15:27.885
I heard them saying, we are doing this.

04:15:27.985 --> 04:15:31.728
We thought about it and this is what we are doing.

04:15:32.208 --> 04:15:41.718
So, yes, it's in the initial stages, but what I'm saying is, I heard you say you thought it through and you were thoughtful and thorough in your thinking through.

04:15:42.359 --> 04:15:52.989
And what I'm trying to suggest is, I'm not sure you thought about all of the parts of the system that need to be agitated to do this work.

04:15:53.550 --> 04:16:11.034
And I'm also suggesting that you're not thinking through your capacity and what you need to tell the state you need to do and need to have as support from the state yourselves to expand this work and to broaden out and sustain this work.

04:16:11.474 --> 04:16:24.363
So while I think what you've done is great, and I realize I'm going to always have to be the naysayer, I'm willing to accept that role, I just want to remind you, you learn things from people who disagree with you too.

04:16:25.004 --> 04:16:29.507
So while I may have to be the naysayer and say, I think you did a great job,

04:16:30.127 --> 04:16:32.810
But here's what you forgot to think about.

04:16:33.270 --> 04:16:56.550
The reason why we have underperforming students, the reason why we have accepted the fact that African-American students are overrepresented in special education, the reason why we forget that the FHA, when it was originally created, didn't allow banks to give mortgages to African-American families, the reason why we accept all those things is that we just simply accept it by salutary neglect.

04:16:57.090 --> 04:16:57.490
And so,

04:16:58.451 --> 04:17:01.354
I'm woke as I warned you a couple of months ago.

04:17:01.374 --> 04:17:05.719
I'm woke and I'm telling you I'm going to help you wake up too.

04:17:07.938 --> 04:17:21.084
I appreciate you reiterating that board member Rucker, especially because in thinking about just teachers and how they learn, you don't take your expert teacher that's meeting their student growth goals and they tell the new teacher how they did it.

04:17:21.404 --> 04:17:26.767
They go through the process of how they did it and what they struggled with to think about what they want to do next.

04:17:27.347 --> 04:17:33.450
And that also just talking about how hard the process is can also just create space for people who are struggling.

04:17:34.170 --> 04:17:36.773
to continue to struggle and be like, OK, you struggled too.

04:17:36.793 --> 04:17:40.636
I mean, sometimes I talk to Cindy and I'm like, Cindy, so I'm new at the board.

04:17:40.796 --> 04:17:41.677
Like, what about this?

04:17:41.817 --> 04:17:43.859
And she doesn't tell me do this, this, this.

04:17:43.879 --> 04:17:48.163
She talks about how she's presented and learned from all of you and been up here.

04:17:48.203 --> 04:17:50.926
So I just appreciate that because I want to make sure we bring that forward in November.

04:17:52.567 --> 04:17:53.148
Chief Deputy.

04:17:53.960 --> 04:17:55.341
Thank you, President Gerson.

04:17:55.401 --> 04:18:09.130
I didn't want to add anything substantive to the conversation except to reiterate the thanks to everyone who made presentations today on behalf of the superintendent and particularly those very busy county superintendents who came to be with us today and share their expertise.

04:18:09.190 --> 04:18:20.118
And lastly, I just wanted to make sure that the board members were aware of the really pivotal role that your staff is playing in this work and to thank them and particularly Dave Sapp.

04:18:20.138 --> 04:18:22.299
I don't know when you sleep, Dave, but, you know, the

04:18:24.320 --> 04:18:26.682
The effort, as Ms.

04:18:26.702 --> 04:18:37.548
Sheppy was just bringing forward, to bring this together involves a lot of struggle, and your staff has been playing a really tremendous role in helping it all happen, and it's an exciting moment for California.

04:18:37.648 --> 04:18:38.449
So, thank you.

04:18:40.779 --> 04:18:41.639
Board Member Valdez.

04:18:43.300 --> 04:18:44.361
Just one last question.

04:18:44.481 --> 04:18:51.023
As we're thinking about the collaborative and it's been in existence for a short period of time, what lessons have we learned and how do we have evidence of that?

04:18:51.063 --> 04:18:52.584
Are there themes coming across?

04:18:52.964 --> 04:18:56.586
That would be nice to be able to hear just at the end of the day.

04:18:56.866 --> 04:18:57.126
Thank you.

04:19:03.399 --> 04:19:05.241
Okay, we're ready for public comment.

04:19:06.302 --> 04:19:06.542
No.

04:19:08.604 --> 04:19:09.685
Yeah, that's what I thought.

04:19:10.026 --> 04:19:11.107
Who's answering the question?

04:19:20.669 --> 04:19:20.970
Is this on?

04:19:21.210 --> 04:19:21.430
Okay.

04:19:21.831 --> 04:19:22.352
Good afternoon.

04:19:22.412 --> 04:19:26.237
Josh Daniels, CCEE, Training Director in Outreach.

04:19:26.858 --> 04:19:33.669
I will give a couple of comments on some of the work that we're doing to the lessons learned and ask my colleague, if she wants to add anything.

04:19:33.689 --> 04:19:35.551
I think

04:19:37.720 --> 04:19:54.097
One of the, and I'll try to boil it down to a couple of key points, one of the most valuable things we have seen so far is, and this has echoed a number of comments with the county superintendents have made and Jason Willis and Melanie and others, the value of collaboration and not just one-time collaboration, but ongoing collaboration.

04:19:54.117 --> 04:19:55.278
And I'll give a concrete example.

04:19:56.524 --> 04:20:06.193
Last year, we did a couple of sets of workshops, and we learned from the fall that there needed to be sort of topic-specific portions of those workshops, so we did breakout sessions.

04:20:06.213 --> 04:20:13.559
And we very intentionally, as part of those breakout sessions, combined a county office co-facilitator with a non-county office facilitator.

04:20:15.060 --> 04:20:22.545
while there has been interaction between county office staff and non-county office staff within counties and across the state, this was topic specific.

04:20:22.805 --> 04:20:37.414
It was coordinated around a particular content area and the feedback we received with that was incredibly helpful both for the county office staff, for the non-county office staff, and also for us learning from the perspectives of each of those folks per that topic.

04:20:38.134 --> 04:20:39.055
And so we've tried to sort of

04:20:39.975 --> 04:20:43.276
take that lesson and apply it in all of the work that we're doing.

04:20:43.336 --> 04:20:51.758
So when we're working with the networks, we don't just have LEAs running networks, we have LEAs and associations and nonprofits running networks.

04:20:52.298 --> 04:21:05.521
When we are reviewing content that's submitted to our upcoming content library, we have review teams that are made up of county office staff, but also district staff and charter staff and advocates, you know, and even a couple of parents.

04:21:06.342 --> 04:21:07.102
And that has been

04:21:08.562 --> 04:21:19.725
One of the, I think, to expand who we think of as our stakeholder pool that really can provide really helpful information and cross-collaboration.

04:21:19.825 --> 04:21:28.887
So, there's a lot of other lessons learned, but that's one concrete one I'll offer at this time, and I'm happy to offer others if there's more time.

04:21:32.906 --> 04:21:36.429
So just thinking about that, those become fundamental principles of intervention.

04:21:36.509 --> 04:21:38.590
And so that's the thing I think we're trying to tease out.

04:21:38.630 --> 04:21:41.733
What does intervention look like and what should be those things?

04:21:41.813 --> 04:21:45.536
And I think to celebrate what we're doing in California, we're being the research, right?

04:21:45.596 --> 04:21:49.660
And so from what's happening, you're creating the framework for what can be.

04:21:49.780 --> 04:21:50.500
So thank you.

04:21:50.700 --> 04:21:50.941
Thank you.

04:21:51.001 --> 04:21:58.267
And Member Rucker, if at any point you want to know about all of the mistakes we've made on this process, I'm happy to talk to you about it because there have been many.

04:22:06.724 --> 04:22:09.586
If I may, Mary Barlow, Kern County Superintendent of Schools.

04:22:10.126 --> 04:22:10.506
Hi.

04:22:11.567 --> 04:22:13.167
So a couple things.

04:22:13.267 --> 04:22:18.870
First of all, in looking at our data and how we hold ourselves accountable, we own the data.

04:22:19.531 --> 04:22:23.633
We feel that we own the data of our county and all of our students and how they're performing.

04:22:23.653 --> 04:22:32.698
And when we saw the disparity, the continued disparity, particularly with African-American students and with our special education population, it was the first thing that came to our attention.

04:22:32.718 --> 04:22:34.659
We need to do something very, very different here.

04:22:35.699 --> 04:22:36.959
That's the first thing.

04:22:37.060 --> 04:22:43.821
In terms of accountability, because we're a pilot of the CCEE, we feel very open and vulnerable.

04:22:44.402 --> 04:22:53.124
We invited all of our own district superintendents to sit in and listen to us as we struggled with our own problem of practice.

04:22:53.844 --> 04:22:55.645
And that was very vulnerable.

04:22:56.565 --> 04:23:02.247
And we learned a lot from them saying to us whether they thought we were on the right track.

04:23:03.147 --> 04:23:16.272
But we also have contracted with and in the process of contracting with Hanover Ed to look at whatever it is that we're going to use to measure our own problem of practice and whether or not we're making a difference for all students within our own model.

04:23:16.532 --> 04:23:18.092
So that's a little bit of what we're doing.

04:23:18.793 --> 04:23:21.894
Most importantly, I wanted to share with you one of our struggles.

04:23:22.874 --> 04:23:37.720
So, we recognized early on when I talked about our description of what was going on when we were delivering our initial services that we didn't have the internal capacity to help districts with that continuous improvement process.

04:23:37.780 --> 04:23:43.122
We ourselves didn't have enough specialization in that area and that's why we had to go out and hire a new team.

04:23:43.622 --> 04:23:47.404
to come in and support us in that effort and train us in that effort.

04:23:47.924 --> 04:23:52.006
And we invested almost a year with this new team that we hired.

04:23:52.166 --> 04:24:12.375
And in addition to regular work, trust me, we're all working hard too, but going to things like cognitive coaching, new pedagogies for deeper learning with Michael Fullen, working with InnovateEd and working with CSESA and CISC and other entities to figure out what it is that we need to understand to help districts with a continuous improvement process.

04:24:13.756 --> 04:24:18.080
we had to change a lot within our own office and how we operate.

04:24:18.481 --> 04:24:21.284
So let me tell you that that is, that's vulnerability.

04:24:21.764 --> 04:24:24.928
And the struggle that we had inside is it hurt a lot of people.

04:24:25.468 --> 04:24:29.232
It hurt a lot of our own staff thinking they were doing a great job for a long time.

04:24:29.933 --> 04:24:33.455
And it was not easy to have those courageous conversations.

04:24:34.095 --> 04:24:35.716
An example of that, and then I'll leave.

04:24:35.776 --> 04:24:41.919
I know I've monopolized a lot of time, but we had a continuous improvement process where we brought three districts together last year.

04:24:42.500 --> 04:24:52.605
And we had them spend days working together and talking about their services that they provide with one another and what was going on and why weren't the students succeeding.

04:24:53.606 --> 04:24:55.367
And one particular district said,

04:24:56.267 --> 04:24:59.749
After they looked in the mirror, they figured out that the problem was themselves.

04:25:00.549 --> 04:25:18.016
The leadership decided it was their low expectations of students, English language learners, not wanting to have low expectations of students, but wanting to make excuses for why maybe they weren't accelerating at the same rate as their peers who are non-English learners.

04:25:18.996 --> 04:25:23.218
And it was very revealing.

04:25:25.399 --> 04:25:26.540
life-changing for them.

04:25:26.860 --> 04:25:37.289
They've brought in other teams from other districts to look at their practices in their classroom and they're changing the trajectory for the kids in their organization.

04:25:37.630 --> 04:25:40.772
So I would say that is a reflection of lessons learned.

04:25:41.633 --> 04:25:46.657
We feel like and others in our organization have said really what we find out is it's us.

04:25:47.178 --> 04:25:48.059
The problem is us.

04:25:48.599 --> 04:25:52.144
our leadership, our adult behavior, and that's hard to look in the mirror.

04:25:52.644 --> 04:25:59.814
So those are some of the most difficult conversations that we're having internally and externally with our districts.

04:26:01.015 --> 04:26:01.336
Thank you.

04:26:02.253 --> 04:26:03.874
Mary, thank you very much.

04:26:04.275 --> 04:26:08.598
I want to tell you there's a Sam Cooke song that's called At Mary's Place.

04:26:09.799 --> 04:26:17.205
So I heard, I heard in your voice as you were talking about the people that were hurt by this process.

04:26:17.585 --> 04:26:19.807
I heard very much how you own that.

04:26:20.247 --> 04:26:23.850
But let me just tell you, I think everybody needs to meet over at Mary's Place.

04:26:27.613 --> 04:26:29.675
Now, I think we are ready for public comment.

04:26:29.715 --> 04:26:30.816
So have the lineup.

04:26:33.928 --> 04:26:35.589
Would the following people please line up.

04:26:35.909 --> 04:26:53.762
Celia Jaffe, Mary Perry, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz, Shelley Spiegel-Coleman, Rachel Mives, Carla Herrera, Lorraine Richards, Martha Alvarez, Sheldon Smith, Liz Guillen, Sarah Lillis, Brian Rivas, and Rebecca Wu.

04:27:01.718 --> 04:27:08.442
Good afternoon, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz representing California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

04:27:08.462 --> 04:27:25.370
In Item 3, Attachment 4, specifically states that the overarching goal of the statewide system of support includes effectively addressing inequities in student opportunities and outcomes.

04:27:26.491 --> 04:27:38.700
While disparities in student opportunities and outcomes are specifically stated, there is no mention in the state plan as to the personnel needed to assist LEAs in addressing these disparities.

04:27:39.621 --> 04:27:54.212
There is no mention in the state plan of the need for personnel with expertise, experience, and depth of knowledge about evidence-based pedagogy and program elements specific to student subgroups, such as English learners.

04:27:54.992 --> 04:28:19.811
Therefore, it is recommended that the state plan make the statement that the system of support should include personnel with expertise, experience, and depth of knowledge on pedagogy as well as program elements for students of groups such as English learners in order to provide appropriate and effective assistance to LEAs in addressing these disparities.

04:28:20.252 --> 04:28:20.532
Thank you.

04:28:21.328 --> 04:28:21.908
Yes.

04:28:22.189 --> 04:28:24.330
Those comments seem more relevant to item four.

04:28:24.450 --> 04:28:28.794
We're... I want to remind the remaining speakers that we're talking about item three.

04:28:29.134 --> 04:28:30.515
So... Sorry.

04:28:32.036 --> 04:28:43.025
Hello again.

04:28:43.205 --> 04:28:45.507
Mary Perry from the California State PTA.

04:28:46.668 --> 04:28:53.374
And it has been really an interesting journey as we've watched the system of continuous improvement develop.

04:28:55.235 --> 04:29:02.321
One person mentioned the fact that November, I think it was you Sue, that November is when the rubber hits the road.

04:29:03.222 --> 04:29:10.648
And I want to underscore the importance that in order to build the kind of trust

04:29:11.363 --> 04:29:26.534
that we need to be open and avoid that sort of Damocles, that really communicating out and explaining what the heck a system of support is to our parent communities is crucial.

04:29:27.837 --> 04:29:41.687
and really developing their capacity to see how family engagement is part of this process, how important they are to the process, how important they are to their children's learning should be part of that communication as well.

04:29:42.227 --> 04:29:52.494
And so not losing sight of that with everything that everyone has to do is something that I really urge the board and the agencies to keep in mind.

04:29:58.140 --> 04:29:59.041
Hi, good afternoon.

04:29:59.401 --> 04:30:07.387
Carla Herrera, retired educator, and I'm from Californians Together, and I'm an alternate member to the EL Roadmap.

04:30:07.467 --> 04:30:13.292
So I want to thank you very much for your unanimous adoption of the EL Roadmap as state policy.

04:30:13.792 --> 04:30:14.332
However,

04:30:15.393 --> 04:30:27.765
The plan for the system of support lacks explicit instructions that utilize and rely on the EL roadmap when addressing inequities resulting in English learners underperformance.

04:30:28.445 --> 04:30:34.031
Also absent in the plan is a specific content of the support to be provided to schools and districts.

04:30:34.571 --> 04:30:49.919
Any technical assistance, no matter the level of intensity, should rely on content that is research and evidence-based, such as the newly adopted Yale Roadmap and the recent report of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Mathematics on the benefits of bilingual education.

04:30:50.459 --> 04:30:57.883
It's recommended that the state plan include explicit instructions and that the content of the system of support be evidence and research-based.

04:30:58.564 --> 04:31:10.380
By doing so, LEAs and schools will have a better understanding of what to expect and how to effectively use a system of support in order to address inequities resulting in underperformance of ELs.

04:31:10.600 --> 04:31:10.921
Thank you.

04:31:15.190 --> 04:31:18.975
Good afternoon, Shelly Spiegel Coleman, Executive Director of Californians Together.

04:31:18.995 --> 04:31:31.990
So to kind of pull together our three comments that we've had here, Martha's comments are really about people who are serving throughout these coordinating agencies that if they're working with the districts, we have to make sure that people who are on the teams

04:31:32.310 --> 04:31:36.954
have the expertise in terms of addressing the student groups for which there are inequities.

04:31:37.534 --> 04:31:42.178
And having worked in a county office, I know that county office staffs are not equal.

04:31:42.578 --> 04:31:46.461
Some have expertise, some have no expertise at all in those areas.

04:31:46.521 --> 04:31:49.143
And so that's the kind of personnel we're thinking about.

04:31:49.503 --> 04:31:55.368
The other piece that Carla was talking about is that we did adopt a roadmap and it has some principles.

04:31:55.508 --> 04:31:56.309
And so I think when

04:31:58.050 --> 04:32:03.413
Peter Bertsell talked about the two sides, standardization but local context.

04:32:03.813 --> 04:32:07.735
So part of standardization is looking at what do we know is true?

04:32:07.775 --> 04:32:09.236
What do we know has effect?

04:32:09.296 --> 04:32:14.559
And we adopted a roadmap that was based upon evidence-based research and practices.

04:32:14.659 --> 04:32:18.762
And we hope that things like that become part of what these agencies use

04:32:19.142 --> 04:32:30.136
when they're working with school districts and they're looking at local context and how that looks in local context will be different, but it's based upon what we know is sound and what we know needs that the board adopted.

04:32:30.476 --> 04:32:33.240
And so we're hoping that that finds its way into the work.

04:32:33.600 --> 04:32:33.961
Thank you.

04:32:40.066 --> 04:32:40.807
Good afternoon.

04:32:41.027 --> 04:32:42.369
My name is Rachel Mavison.

04:32:42.509 --> 04:32:50.640
I come before you as a former teacher, state approved date provider, private school principal, superintendent, and now director at a county office of education.

04:32:50.820 --> 04:32:54.365
I am a strong advocate of our state's direction in education.

04:32:55.106 --> 04:33:01.111
I'd like to suggest the board consider differentiated assistance this year with flexible requirements.

04:33:01.611 --> 04:33:07.636
Districts are being held accountable for indicators on a dashboard that are not yet fully developed and using leg data.

04:33:08.057 --> 04:33:16.384
Allowing a year of flexible requirements would provide districts an opportunity to focus on improvement instead of shifting templates in a developing dashboard.

04:33:16.924 --> 04:33:32.391
COEs can continue to develop a different approach to differentiated assistance working with willing districts and you the CCEE regional leads and stakeholder groups could work to clarify the ambiguity in the statute with implementation in 2018-19.

04:33:32.951 --> 04:33:42.755
Fullon notes in his recent report that California is faced with the daunting task of shifting the mindset of a massively complex organization from compliance to continuous improvement.

04:33:43.475 --> 04:33:55.522
If from the very onset of our new accountability system, it is unclear, lacks credibility, how are we making strides toward disrupting the compliance narrative and replacing it with a more valuable commitment to implementation?

04:33:55.922 --> 04:33:56.343
Thank you.

04:34:02.554 --> 04:34:06.857
Good afternoon, Martha Alvarez on behalf of AXA, the Association of California School Administrators.

04:34:07.678 --> 04:34:19.988
In addition to echoing the comments made by a prior speaker, I'd like to commend the staff for continuing this discussion with the board and stakeholders to ensure that there's ample opportunity for public comment on this system of support.

04:34:20.688 --> 04:34:31.677
We appreciate that there's a distinction between the 17-18 assistance that will happen in the next several months and then the 17-18 and beyond work, which is outlined in our letters, comments to the state board letter.

04:34:32.257 --> 04:34:44.540
Regarding 17-18 assistance similar to the prior speaker, we want to encourage the system of support to be focusing on the planning time and that communication needs to be clear to the field and to the parents, the stakeholders, teachers, etc.

04:34:44.980 --> 04:34:56.983
so that we don't expect any quick changes halfway through the 17-18 school year and instead continuing to integrate that work in planning for the 18-19 LCAP and those student services.

04:34:57.723 --> 04:35:08.947
For the 18-19 school year and beyond, we echo the comments by CPAC and other stakeholder members regarding the customized, individualized support, networks, data analysis, et cetera.

04:35:09.467 --> 04:35:11.368
AXA continues to be a partner in this work.

04:35:11.408 --> 04:35:19.351
We want to engage you and the staff, and we hope you'll hear from supporting tenants in the future about what's happening on the ground and how their recipients have the support.

04:35:19.631 --> 04:35:19.951
Thank you.

04:35:35.630 --> 04:35:50.620
Hi my name is Rebecca Donwu credential teacher and we need to require the COEs to do or gonna do to do one of the additional steps that they need to do when they do their civil rights Williams Act County audits for vacancies and miss assignments.

04:35:51.000 --> 04:35:57.625
What they need to do is look at all certificated staff including substitutes over a course of a year.

04:35:58.686 --> 04:36:05.210
They need to look and find ghost teachers or vacancies that are not reported to them intentionally or not by the districts.

04:36:06.250 --> 04:36:19.858
SCOE failed to find this at one public school, so not a charter, in TRUSD in Del Paso for 15 years, an economically disadvantaged school that I worked at.

04:36:20.478 --> 04:36:23.840
Twin Rivers had qualified teachers, so not

04:36:24.880 --> 04:36:34.584
So not teacher shortages, which is what a grand jury looked into for all the county saying that there were teacher shortages within the county.

04:36:34.884 --> 04:36:36.324
That was not the issue in this case.

04:36:37.324 --> 04:36:39.045
They were classified as substitutes.

04:36:43.347 --> 04:36:44.827
They were classified as substitutes.

04:36:44.847 --> 04:36:50.049
Thank you.

04:36:51.482 --> 04:36:53.644
Lorraine Richards, California Teachers Association.

04:36:54.145 --> 04:37:04.696
CTA agrees with the statement in attachment four that there is an opportunity to clarify the roles and responsibilities of within the system of support and seeks answers with a focus on the needs of each student.

04:37:05.156 --> 04:37:10.662
Ensure that differentiated assistant includes a comprehensive review of all local and state indicators.

04:37:11.483 --> 04:37:16.967
educators need or how students basic needs and conditions in and around the school should be addressed.

04:37:17.427 --> 04:37:34.038
We recommend asking the representatives of all involved agencies to explain how the system will tangibly integrate all federal and local components into a coherent and cohesive set of supports that focus on the whole child and the whole system factors and support equity of access and opportunities.

04:37:34.638 --> 04:37:38.641
We also encourage the state to shed the different labels of level one and level two.

04:37:39.481 --> 04:37:40.441
Finally, questions.

04:37:40.501 --> 04:37:56.086
How will the agencies be responsible for providing support, clearly and publicly identify the point of contact for accessing the system, and provide the open door for students, parents, and educators and community stakeholders such that the access is not appropriately restricted?

04:37:56.526 --> 04:38:02.008
Are there any emerging lessons from the pilot other than the CCE that are ready to be shared?

04:38:02.208 --> 04:38:02.488
Thank you.

04:38:08.752 --> 04:38:09.632
President Kirst.

04:38:10.172 --> 04:38:13.053
Brian Reeves speaking on behalf of the Education Trust West.

04:38:14.334 --> 04:38:28.478
We think that you've got the right people working on the right issues trying to come up with the right solutions but we'd like to see a little more detail and Member Rucker as you were talking it made me think

04:38:29.978 --> 04:38:35.759
Low-income communities and communities of color have heard similar promises in the past.

04:38:36.520 --> 04:38:40.861
And we feel as advocates, you know, we can go back, you probably know the programs better than I do.

04:38:41.501 --> 04:38:44.421
SIG, QEIA, this is the latest thing.

04:38:44.461 --> 04:38:55.684
And we feel as advocates for those communities, our role is to press for answers on how all of this talk and work is going to connect directly to moving the needle for students.

04:38:56.344 --> 04:38:57.226
those communities.

04:38:57.266 --> 04:39:03.113
So we'd like to see more detail on how the work translates into improvement for subgroups.

04:39:03.954 --> 04:39:13.045
We like the root cause needs analysis, I believe is what it's called, and we think that it might be strengthened by having an external agency involved.

04:39:13.705 --> 04:39:14.026
Thank you.

04:39:19.895 --> 04:39:21.616
Good afternoon, Sarah Lillis with EdVoice.

04:39:21.976 --> 04:39:26.798
And like Mr. Rivas, we are also struggling with a lack of detail.

04:39:27.258 --> 04:39:28.458
We understand what we don't want to be.

04:39:28.538 --> 04:39:29.999
We understand the larger vision.

04:39:30.019 --> 04:39:31.299
We understand what the statute says.

04:39:32.100 --> 04:39:41.083
But as President Kerr said, we still don't understand how this is going to work for locals and particularly in supporting subgroups.

04:39:41.944 --> 04:39:44.807
And we understand, we appreciate LCFF's focus on subgroups.

04:39:44.847 --> 04:39:47.510
At the same time, how are these agencies going to work together?

04:39:47.570 --> 04:39:49.812
Mr. Willis said we don't have an answer to that question yet.

04:39:49.872 --> 04:39:59.964
And we really hope that the state, that you all as a policymaking body for the state in terms of moving forward beyond the statute, can provide some real guidance as to how we can get

04:40:00.444 --> 04:40:08.674
this system to work and all the agencies to work together, not just meet and talk, but actually provide more detail to the public so we now know how it's all going to function.

04:40:08.995 --> 04:40:17.786
And particularly, we also echo the comments on focusing on using the tools we do have, like the EL roadmap, and really focusing on English learners and subgroups.

04:40:17.906 --> 04:40:18.086
Thanks.

04:40:22.355 --> 04:40:24.856
Hello again, Liz Guillen with Public Advocates.

04:40:25.697 --> 04:40:29.619
Many thanks for this item around the system of support.

04:40:30.680 --> 04:40:38.004
Really good to see that one of the steps is a needs assessment and root cause analysis of student outcomes.

04:40:39.184 --> 04:40:49.090
Very happy to hear the conversation looking at analysis of the capacities of adults to change.

04:40:50.431 --> 04:40:54.054
That is really, I think, one of our most pressing concerns.

04:40:55.515 --> 04:41:13.790
Ineffective school leadership, low staff morale, the lack of staff cohesion or apparent in student engagement, severely adverse working conditions, many, many things that have to be addressed before really creating a plan of action.

04:41:17.583 --> 04:41:32.956
We talked with staff this week and we raised our hand in terms of interest and desire to work with the department on some of the stakeholder engagement, especially as it relates to community parents and students.

04:41:33.036 --> 04:41:33.477
Thank you.

04:41:37.998 --> 04:41:40.078
Hello members, this is Swapnil.

04:41:41.179 --> 04:41:45.800
I'm here to mainly raise an important point about the IQC.

04:41:45.820 --> 04:41:50.681
It's an Instructional Quality Commission and reject the history.

04:41:50.861 --> 04:41:52.861
This is the wrong item for this public comment.

04:41:52.881 --> 04:41:54.962
This is more appropriate for general public comment.

04:41:58.283 --> 04:41:58.823
Okay, thank you.

04:42:05.826 --> 04:42:09.289
Good afternoon, Lea Angela Reed on behalf of the Small School Districts Association.

04:42:09.910 --> 04:42:16.676
First I want to thank the department and state board staff for their work on this and thank you for the thoughtful conversation.

04:42:17.136 --> 04:42:24.763
I appreciate the comments by my colleague Mr. Rivas relative to some of the old programs that make some of us wince and some folks have PTSD.

04:42:25.944 --> 04:42:29.047
We still have districts that are in program improvement for perpetuity.

04:42:29.487 --> 04:42:32.430
So, but I think the difference is that

04:42:33.090 --> 04:42:36.212
Today, we are what you are doing with rather than to.

04:42:37.193 --> 04:42:39.674
And I can't understate the importance of that.

04:42:40.415 --> 04:42:51.662
Whether it be the stakeholder group that that staff are having here, where everyone is involved and everyone hears each other's comments and so forth to what's going on at the local level and in folks feeling empowered.

04:42:51.722 --> 04:42:53.523
None of us know really where we're headed.

04:42:53.543 --> 04:42:54.824
I mean, because this is all new.

04:42:55.164 --> 04:42:57.586
It's sort of like being in a room full of furniture with the lights out.

04:42:57.606 --> 04:42:58.867
You don't know what's there till you hit it.

04:42:59.798 --> 04:43:03.583
But we're all moving forward together because we're all involved and all feel empowered.

04:43:03.683 --> 04:43:07.247
So I just want to support you in the work that you're doing.

04:43:07.487 --> 04:43:09.269
We know the conversations need to be had.

04:43:09.570 --> 04:43:10.551
We're willing to have those.

04:43:10.851 --> 04:43:11.492
And we thank you.

04:43:11.512 --> 04:43:17.439
Board member Ortiz-Lacon.

04:43:19.273 --> 04:43:41.125
I have a question of our timeline here because yes, we still obviously there's a lot of details and a lot of questions that we still have in terms of making sure that we have a cadre of experts that are addressing issues as they're identified and that it's experts not just general consultants or general folks that are addressing some of these very specific areas of need of improvement.

04:43:41.645 --> 04:43:48.874
We also heard a couple of people reference some of the tools and frameworks that we have, the EO roadmap, and making sure that we mention and reference that.

04:43:49.315 --> 04:43:51.898
The monitoring and accountability, where does that fall?

04:43:53.320 --> 04:43:56.764
Even with the county offices, if I'm in one

04:43:57.805 --> 04:44:01.667
in one county, but I don't want to take services or support from that county.

04:44:01.967 --> 04:44:03.888
Am I married to that attendance zone?

04:44:03.928 --> 04:44:06.629
Is it like a school that I need to or can I go somewhere else?

04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:17.214
And the other thing that happens, and I think we need support from external partners and community-based organizations and nonprofits, but we could also have this

04:44:18.774 --> 04:44:24.118
since everyone's mentioning him, innovation overload, where we don't know what the magic sauce actually was.

04:44:24.298 --> 04:44:25.959
So what made the difference, right?

04:44:25.999 --> 04:44:38.688
And so somebody that's also there to tease out and make sure that not everything's being thrown into the pot, but that it's very deliberate and intentional so that we could then say, this is what worked with this subgroup and this didn't.

04:44:38.848 --> 04:44:40.649
So we can't bring that back into the pot.

04:44:41.610 --> 04:44:46.273
So all of those details are not here, but I'm assuming that we will eventually add more to this.

04:44:46.353 --> 04:44:48.054
And I'm just wondering what that timeline is.

04:44:50.255 --> 04:44:50.575
Thank you.

04:44:50.595 --> 04:44:55.378
So timeline just specifically on how we'll provide more details about what the support looks like.

04:44:55.938 --> 04:45:02.061
So on the first piece, I might have said this earlier, but we want to make sure that we continue to highlight specific counties.

04:45:02.721 --> 04:45:12.146
But to go to both of your points from earlier, Board Member Rucker, Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe, we also want to talk about what work are we doing to build the capacity of all counties.

04:45:12.946 --> 04:45:20.908
So, we're sat down with SESSA last week and talking about, you know, we have all these stakeholder engagement sessions with people at districts and schools.

04:45:21.748 --> 04:45:26.510
Have we really thought about what counties need and what that's going to look like for northern counties versus southern counties?

04:45:26.550 --> 04:45:32.811
And how can we at CDE and the other state agencies help understand that need for capacity building?

04:45:32.831 --> 04:45:33.212
And I think

04:45:35.012 --> 04:45:42.197
So that's just I think we definitely could bring back maybe even a timeline of some of the work that we're planning to do to build out the county support.

04:45:42.497 --> 04:45:56.406
But then in November and subsequent meetings, highlighting specific counties, but then also talking about how are we strengthening county capacity in general and giving counties the space to talk about what they need that might be beyond, you know, me and my team.

04:45:57.046 --> 04:45:58.487
But I mean, you know, sorry.

04:45:58.547 --> 04:46:00.389
So I don't think that answers your question specifically.

04:46:01.209 --> 04:46:14.278
But those are two things we can do, and I think, hopefully, as we talk about strengthening counties' capacity, those pieces around how are they using things like EL roadmap, how are they using the curriculum frameworks, what do they need when it comes to data analysis.

04:46:14.698 --> 04:46:24.906
Me and my team went to the improvement science training last week put on by Carnegie and SESSA and CCEE, and we talked to some Central Valley counties that said, you know, I know this is my data.

04:46:25.566 --> 04:46:26.906
But I don't know how to pull it out.

04:46:28.127 --> 04:46:34.068
And it was in the safe space of, hey, you work at CDE, and you seem friendly, and you're asking me what I need.

04:46:34.488 --> 04:46:39.750
But we need to be able to say, these are some of the needs, and here's how we can meet them, and maybe here's how we can't.

04:46:39.890 --> 04:46:41.030
And so what are we going to do about it?

04:46:41.410 --> 04:46:44.211
So I want to be able to bring that forward, too.

04:46:46.570 --> 04:46:52.092
Okay, so now we'll move to item four and the S.S.

04:46:52.112 --> 04:46:52.753
State Plan.

04:46:52.813 --> 04:46:58.295
So I'm going to make a few opening remarks to paint the context a bit.

04:46:58.855 --> 04:47:04.118
We deliberately sequenced this agenda so that people got a feel

04:47:04.918 --> 04:47:13.000
for the importance of state policy and how it intensifies and relates to federal policy.

04:47:13.600 --> 04:47:15.721
And we covered our assessment system.

04:47:16.201 --> 04:47:22.683
We covered our dashboard and our indicators and then the system of support.

04:47:23.223 --> 04:47:33.566
So very much what you're going to hear in the state plan is something that interacts and reinforces and as best we can, given the two laws, integrates the two systems.

04:47:35.000 --> 04:47:49.370
I wanted to mention to the board members for what we're going to be doing next because some of the very important parts of federal aid will be coming after the state plan is approved.

04:47:49.891 --> 04:47:59.958
First of all, we need to, we will be notifying local districts that all of their applications for federal aid under all titles are defunct.

04:48:01.338 --> 04:48:02.659
They have to reapply.

04:48:02.679 --> 04:48:03.839
It is a new law.

04:48:04.759 --> 04:48:09.721
The last times they applied, as far as I can tell, was between the years 2003 and 2006.

04:48:11.501 --> 04:48:19.624
We were one of the few states that never got a waiver for NCLB, so we operated on NCLB right to the end.

04:48:20.453 --> 04:48:28.842
So we will be developing an application process for districts to apply for their federal aid.

04:48:28.902 --> 04:48:30.423
These are categorical funds.

04:48:30.483 --> 04:48:33.707
They require an application process.

04:48:35.068 --> 04:48:40.394
And that will be probably in the form of an addendum to the LCAP.

04:48:41.297 --> 04:48:51.568
But having worked on the original applications in 1965 for Title I, I realized the application process can be an important policy lever.

04:48:52.068 --> 04:48:53.530
So that is yet to come.

04:48:54.191 --> 04:49:01.438
And I think we'll, you know, I just want to highlight that as one thing in this regard.

04:49:02.379 --> 04:49:13.292
Second of all, we will be developing with the budget, through the budget process under California state law, the legislature gets into this.

04:49:14.053 --> 04:49:19.118
What we are going to do with a set of sides that are in Title I.

04:49:20.424 --> 04:49:23.848
and the other titles in the ESSA law.

04:49:24.549 --> 04:49:35.122
For example, we must, under ESSA law, withhold as a state 7% of Title I. That is approximately $118 million.

04:49:38.123 --> 04:49:52.242
Now, it's quite likely, it seems to me, that some of the system of support for local districts and schools that was mentioned today would be, could be integrated into those

04:49:53.223 --> 04:49:59.287
set-asides we have like the 7% set-aside in Title I. We could strengthen that system.

04:50:00.247 --> 04:50:02.689
We could decide how to work with it.

04:50:02.769 --> 04:50:14.616
We must make all grants to local education agencies under Title I, but we could use intermediaries to fund functions the state thinks are important.

04:50:15.576 --> 04:50:18.538
So I think that there is a considerable amount there.

04:50:19.359 --> 04:50:19.939
Title III,

04:50:20.359 --> 04:50:30.184
Three, I'm sorry, Title II, the teacher profession area, that has a set aside of approximately $6 million.

04:50:31.405 --> 04:50:34.587
Through the budget process, we will be making some proposals there.

04:50:34.667 --> 04:50:37.288
People have talked about a school leadership initiative.

04:50:38.329 --> 04:50:40.470
So that will be, I think, important.

04:50:41.823 --> 04:50:48.345
Lastly, there are state set-asides for administration and direct state services.

04:50:49.805 --> 04:50:53.586
And we'll be discussing one of those today in Title IV-A.

04:50:54.066 --> 04:51:00.368
But there are also state set-asides of 4% or 5% in the other titles.

04:51:00.768 --> 04:51:04.369
And only 1% of that can be used for state administration.

04:51:04.929 --> 04:51:07.190
So this is direct state services

04:51:08.691 --> 04:51:21.784
which could be related to our prior topic of a system of support that would be available for us to allocate again in discussion with the legislature through the budget process.

04:51:22.544 --> 04:51:31.833
So, to sum up here, there's a prior, as we look at the ESSA plan, there's a prior state context that we have talked about today

04:51:32.594 --> 04:51:44.787
There is an asset plan and then there are significant set of policy levers and discretionary state funds that will come after the state plan is filed.

04:51:45.508 --> 04:51:54.237
So, I think the audience and others should understand what I've outlined here, which is a tripartite context.

04:51:55.078 --> 04:52:04.940
And on a personal note, it bothers me that a lot of critics, including people from outside the state, look at only our state plan.

04:52:05.360 --> 04:52:16.163
And they don't look at all of this context, some of which is, in my view, the third stage of context, the third stage that I outlined is very important as well.

04:52:16.903 --> 04:52:22.985
So, I just want to set that scene for us in terms of what we're going to see today.

04:52:25.186 --> 04:52:36.229
But I certainly believe the State Plan is important, but that we've got a totality of policy here and we need to view this discussion in the State Plan within that totality.

04:52:36.589 --> 04:52:45.152
And the Board has much interesting work left around the issues that have been discussed through the State Plan.

04:52:45.772 --> 04:52:52.414
So with no further ado, then I'll have Barbara Murchison who's going to go through the state plan.

04:52:53.054 --> 04:52:58.916
So Barbara will explain all the changes that have been made since our last board meeting.

04:52:59.576 --> 04:53:03.857
Then we'll have a round robin of any board members who want to speak on any issue.

04:53:04.277 --> 04:53:05.678
Then we'll have public comment.

04:53:06.218 --> 04:53:21.011
Then we'll have another open board discussion and then we can expect some motions because the CDE will be recommending three motions for us in terms of motions that we have to take.

04:53:21.751 --> 04:53:28.077
Board member Ting Sun, who is a federal liaison with me, will present those motions.

04:53:28.397 --> 04:53:29.678
So that's our procedure.

04:53:29.898 --> 04:53:31.640
Barbara, please proceed.

04:53:32.162 --> 04:53:33.564
Thank you, President Kirst.

04:53:33.604 --> 04:53:37.308
Good afternoon, Chief Deputy Superintendent Price, board members.

04:53:37.409 --> 04:53:40.953
I'm Barbara Murchison, ESSA State Lead here at the Department of Education.

04:53:41.914 --> 04:53:49.524
The purpose of this item is to provide you and the public with an update on the development of the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA State Plan.

04:53:51.621 --> 04:53:52.442
And here we are.

04:53:52.762 --> 04:54:04.531
Today is the day that the CDE is recommending to the board that you approve the ESSA state plan for submission to the United States Department of Education on September 18, 2017.

04:54:05.172 --> 04:54:07.553
That is Monday.

04:54:09.015 --> 04:54:17.101
Pending board executive director approval of final revisions requested by the board and correction of any typographical errors.

04:54:20.365 --> 04:54:23.566
So here is the last timeline I will share with you regarding the S.S.

04:54:23.706 --> 04:54:24.186
State Plan.

04:54:24.206 --> 04:54:31.227
We've seen a number of timelines since I first stood before you in May 2016, and this is a short one.

04:54:32.087 --> 04:54:36.348
In July, you provided the CDE with direction regarding revisions to the S.S.

04:54:36.488 --> 04:54:37.188
State Plan.

04:54:37.848 --> 04:54:42.249
We made the approved revisions, and on August 8th, provided you with a new draft of the S.S.

04:54:42.369 --> 04:54:47.690
State Plan, which I'll refer to as the August draft in an information memorandum.

04:54:48.850 --> 04:54:58.855
And in that memo, we asked stakeholders who wanted to provide feedback on the draft to submit their comments to us by August 25th so we could include their feedback in this item.

04:54:59.615 --> 04:55:02.736
A summary of that feedback is provided in Attachment 1.

04:55:04.197 --> 04:55:11.320
We also reviewed information about the August draft with the California Practitioners Advisory Group during its meeting on August 24th.

04:55:12.741 --> 04:55:16.923
And moving down to those last two rows in the table,

04:55:18.140 --> 04:55:22.823
We need to submit the plan to ED on Monday, next Monday, September 18th.

04:55:23.304 --> 04:55:26.666
So we're bringing the plan to you for approval today.

04:55:29.764 --> 04:55:31.745
So here is our recommendation.

04:55:31.825 --> 04:55:48.794
The CDE recommends that the board approve the Every Student Succeeds Act state plan for submission to ED on September 18, 2017, pending executive director approval of the final revisions requested by the board and correction of any typographical errors.

04:55:49.554 --> 04:55:51.735
We have a few final proposed revisions.

04:55:52.235 --> 04:55:55.836
You may have additional proposed revisions to discuss today.

04:55:56.196 --> 04:55:59.578
And we are aware of a couple of typographical errors in the document.

04:55:59.978 --> 04:56:11.222
So again, that is why we're asking you to approve it pending final revisions that we will make and that your executive director will approve before we submit to the United States Department of Education.

04:56:12.938 --> 04:56:14.439
So we have a lot to cover today.

04:56:15.579 --> 04:56:23.723
As President Kearse laid out, first I'm going to spend a little time providing some context for the plan, kind of build on some of his opening remarks.

04:56:24.223 --> 04:56:27.684
Then we're going to go over some key features in the August draft.

04:56:27.764 --> 04:56:40.610
Those of you who were either watching or participating in the CPAG meeting, you'll notice it's going to be very similar to that CPAG meeting where I'm going to talk about what we heard from stakeholders and then talk about

04:56:40.990 --> 04:56:43.913
how we made revisions based on that stakeholder feedback.

04:56:44.594 --> 04:56:50.019
Then I'm going to present the additional revisions proposed in this item.

04:56:50.459 --> 04:57:03.553
So as I mentioned, we put out the August draft, got some feedback from folks, and now I want to talk about the three revisions that are actually in the item and attachment two of the item and walk through those.

04:57:04.830 --> 04:57:11.634
And then we're going to take a look at three additional relatively minor proposed revisions that are not in the item.

04:57:13.035 --> 04:57:17.217
You just received a handout with those proposed revisions.

04:57:17.798 --> 04:57:23.201
I'm going to pause for questions and board discussion a couple of times during this presentation.

04:57:25.558 --> 04:57:27.518
People are really excited already about that.

04:57:27.579 --> 04:57:28.239
That's great.

04:57:29.519 --> 04:57:37.521
But in the interest of time today, I'm not going to go over our whole stakeholder engagement strategy.

04:57:38.221 --> 04:57:42.902
Certainly, you are aware of those four formal phases of stakeholder engagement.

04:57:42.922 --> 04:57:47.303
There's information about that on the item, plenty on our web pages if people have questions.

04:57:48.704 --> 04:57:53.165
Obviously, we're here to talk about that, but we're not going to go into that because we do have a lot of other things to cover today.

04:57:55.226 --> 04:58:03.716
So first, let's firmly situate this state plan into the larger California context.

04:58:03.776 --> 04:58:07.321
It feels important to put this document into perspective.

04:58:07.921 --> 04:58:12.527
I have to say this morning, I woke up thinking about the day to come.

04:58:13.160 --> 04:58:20.322
And I had a little flashback to the first time I brought a state plan to this board, and I was thinking about it.

04:58:20.922 --> 04:58:31.865
Four of you were actually here when I presented the Common Core State Standards Systems Implementation Plan for California in January of 2012.

04:58:34.542 --> 04:58:39.964
And I thought, maybe I'll just grab like a screenshot of me presenting to the board.

04:58:40.004 --> 04:58:42.966
And I thought, no, that, you all look great.

04:58:45.627 --> 04:58:50.109
But I'm not sure the last five and a half years really treated me quite as well.

04:58:51.449 --> 04:58:52.750
So we're not going to do that.

04:58:54.091 --> 04:58:59.193
But in thinking about this and in preparing this presentation, I think there's a lot

04:59:02.284 --> 04:59:04.165
I think we want more.

04:59:04.205 --> 04:59:05.365
We want this to be done.

04:59:05.686 --> 04:59:08.507
We want all of the answers about how all of this is going to work.

04:59:08.927 --> 04:59:17.171
I think it's useful for all of us to just take a moment, and I'm going to take that moment, to talk about everything that's been going.

04:59:17.191 --> 04:59:19.632
This has been a super busy board.

04:59:19.652 --> 04:59:24.494
All right, so I'm just going to take a little minute to talk a bit more about the California system.

04:59:25.154 --> 04:59:27.015
beyond the SSA plan.

04:59:27.335 --> 04:59:29.955
And brace yourselves, because it's been a lot of work.

04:59:29.975 --> 04:59:31.616
You really should look more tired.

04:59:32.496 --> 04:59:45.360
Since 2010, the board has adopted new content standards for English language arts, English language development, mathematics, science, career technical education, and the model school library standards.

04:59:47.125 --> 04:59:48.445
That's a lot of new standards.

04:59:48.906 --> 04:59:55.988
There are additional standards underway for visual and performing arts, world language, and computer science right now.

04:59:56.788 --> 05:00:10.172
You've also adopted new curriculum frameworks for English language arts, English language development, mathematics, science, and history social science with additional framework development underway for health right now and additional subjects on the near horizon.

05:00:11.291 --> 05:00:22.501
You've adopted new instructional materials for ELA, ELD, mathematics, and we anticipate that new materials for history social science will be brought to you for adoption later this year.

05:00:24.203 --> 05:00:26.685
Oh, and California has a new assessment system.

05:00:28.287 --> 05:00:29.067
That little thing.

05:00:29.508 --> 05:00:37.115
With new tests either operational or close to operational for English language arts, mathematics, English language development, and science.

05:00:38.857 --> 05:00:51.928
Since 2013, you've also been working to implement the local control funding formula, fundamentally changing how resources are provided to schools and holding local educational agencies accountable for improving student performance.

05:00:52.609 --> 05:01:01.196
The LCFF reflects California's commitment to equity, providing additional funds to LEAs to support low-income students, English learners, and foster youth.

05:01:02.236 --> 05:01:12.263
California's new LCFF based accountability system focused on performance of 13 distinct statutorily defined student groups.

05:01:13.043 --> 05:01:26.012
And we have a new dashboard that reports performance data for all districts, all schools, and all student groups on multiple indicators aligned to LCFF state priorities.

05:01:29.622 --> 05:01:31.903
That's a lot of work, all right?

05:01:31.963 --> 05:01:36.625
I know you know this, but to write it all down and to say it, I mean, yeah.

05:01:37.026 --> 05:01:45.910
So LCFF requires the districts receive additional support if they have one or more student groups struggling across more than one indicator in the accountability system.

05:01:46.670 --> 05:01:51.853
As was detailed and discussed in item three, those supports are beginning in earnest this fall.

05:01:53.482 --> 05:02:03.775
So all of this is just to say that all of this work began long before the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was reauthorized in December 2015.

05:02:05.437 --> 05:02:10.283
And the work will continue well beyond the submission of this ESSA state plan.

05:02:16.354 --> 05:02:26.164
Everything accomplished to date has been done in partnership with many, many education stakeholders and future activities will be done in collaboration with stakeholders as well.

05:02:26.864 --> 05:02:36.494
My colleagues both here at the department and from other agencies have spent the past few hours sharing some of the work to come to continue building out California's LCFF-based system.

05:02:37.515 --> 05:02:56.101
As we move beyond plan development and into implementation of ESSA, we will continue to work together to address many of the ESSA provisions that are not detailed in the ESSA state plan, such as the implementation of the LCAP addendum and how the state will collect school-level expenditure information as required by federal law.

05:02:57.176 --> 05:03:03.058
Also, although we are submitting the plan next week, California is free to update the plan as necessary.

05:03:03.679 --> 05:03:11.042
For example, we know that there are more details to work out regarding the methodology for identifying the lowest performing 5% of schools.

05:03:11.742 --> 05:03:21.586
Those details and other refinements to the system will be provided to ED as necessary as we continue to develop California's system.

05:03:23.180 --> 05:03:25.182
So I really like this quote.

05:03:25.202 --> 05:03:29.225
I think in one sentence it kind of encapsulates everything we're trying to do.

05:03:29.646 --> 05:03:34.850
I've been here since 8.30 listening to items one through three along with you.

05:03:34.990 --> 05:03:39.834
And if there is any theme at all, I think it is captured in this quote.

05:03:40.515 --> 05:03:44.500
The culture of continuous improvement must infuse all parts of the system.

05:03:45.121 --> 05:03:47.103
And I didn't add this bold language.

05:03:47.163 --> 05:03:59.118
This language is in, and I'm sorry I didn't identify it earlier, the Superintendent's Accountability and Continuous Improvement Task Force Report, including continuous improvement for the system itself.

05:03:59.980 --> 05:04:11.844
That has been the theme all morning, your deep commitment to evaluating and making adjustments and continuously improving the system as it evolves.

05:04:12.244 --> 05:04:15.306
That's key to what it is we're trying to do here in California.

05:04:15.406 --> 05:04:21.828
So I think just bearing that in mind makes it easier to make the decisions that move us forward.

05:04:25.606 --> 05:04:29.449
I know this graphic will make one board member at least very happy.

05:04:29.469 --> 05:04:37.474
It also seems really important to put the amount of ESSA funding California receives into our larger context.

05:04:40.816 --> 05:04:41.857
So here's a graphic.

05:04:41.897 --> 05:04:45.059
This is the graphic in our item, but here it is in full color.

05:04:45.119 --> 05:04:48.641
Here's a graphic showing revenue sources for California's K-12 schools.

05:04:50.489 --> 05:04:59.097
The relatively small green bands on the top of each of these bar graphs represents the total amount of federal funding that California receives.

05:04:59.917 --> 05:05:14.390
For 2017-18, which is, you can see the funding's growing, that's the one on the far right of the slide, approximately $8.1 billion of federal funds are included in California's total $92.5 billion education budget.

05:05:17.353 --> 05:05:23.874
It's important to note that ESSA funds represent only about two and a half billion or so of that federal funding.

05:05:24.214 --> 05:05:28.795
So we're talking about less than a third of that green band.

05:05:28.815 --> 05:05:31.576
That's a very small green band.

05:05:34.377 --> 05:05:35.117
I did not say that.

05:05:35.377 --> 05:05:42.338
Still, ESSA funds are very important to us because they're meant to support some of our most vulnerable students.

05:05:43.759 --> 05:05:45.439
So we are applying for those funds.

05:05:46.823 --> 05:05:48.124
That's what this plan is.

05:05:48.544 --> 05:05:50.325
It's an application for federal funds.

05:05:51.126 --> 05:05:56.770
Anyone who has applied for a grant knows that it's important to answer application questions completely.

05:05:57.590 --> 05:06:05.496
And those of us who have read grant applications really appreciate it when applicants are able to respond to questions in a concise manner.

05:06:06.966 --> 05:06:15.268
In March, ED provided states with peer review criteria, providing us with an even better idea of exactly what information that they are looking for.

05:06:16.049 --> 05:06:24.091
We used those peer review criteria to address the prompts in the grant application as completely and as concisely as possible.

05:06:25.526 --> 05:06:29.628
To be determined is not a very strong response for a grant application.

05:06:30.268 --> 05:06:38.652
So even though there is a lot of exciting work underway, the plan generally does not include references to work that is not complete.

05:06:39.632 --> 05:06:43.134
There are many provisions in the ESSA that are not addressed in the template.

05:06:43.534 --> 05:06:46.515
So we didn't provide information regarding those provisions.

05:06:47.296 --> 05:06:54.759
And to be very clear, because I'm not sure it's completely understood, this is a state application for funds.

05:06:55.359 --> 05:07:00.042
that describes what the state is going to do regarding the specific prompts.

05:07:00.602 --> 05:07:06.325
It does not include information about what local educational agencies will do about ESSA.

05:07:06.746 --> 05:07:12.129
They will tell us about how they're addressing federal requirements in their LCAP addenda.

05:07:17.904 --> 05:07:19.885
So, these should look very familiar.

05:07:19.965 --> 05:07:23.086
At the January meeting, you approved this set of guiding principles.

05:07:23.886 --> 05:07:38.913
The principles state that our plan will support the creation of a single, coherent, local, state, and federal accountability and continuous improvement system, with state priorities and direction leading, and opportunities in the ESSA leveraged to assist in accomplishing state goals and objectives.

05:07:39.893 --> 05:07:59.008
The principles also really reflect our commitment to updating the federal required applications and plans to reinforce and align with state priorities and to use ESSA resources to support the implementation of rigorous standards and the principles of equity, local control, and continuous improvement that drive our LCFF-based system.

05:07:59.889 --> 05:08:04.393
California's state plan, I'm happy to report, adheres to these principles.

05:08:08.618 --> 05:08:13.969
So with all of that context in mind, let's take a few minutes to review the August draft.

05:08:15.239 --> 05:08:26.462
In July, you approved a motion authorizing us to make changes to the May draft to address both the phase four stakeholder feedback and the peer review criteria.

05:08:27.222 --> 05:08:40.125
These revisions were made bearing in mind your direction to develop a plan that supports the implementation of LCFF per the guiding principles and with the knowledge that California system will continue to evolve beyond plan approval.

05:08:41.428 --> 05:08:49.712
For each one of the plan sections, I'm going to share a little bit about what we heard from stakeholders and the changes that were made based on that feedback.

05:08:51.873 --> 05:08:58.676
Two sections, before we get into it, two sections of the May draft of the plan were not changed at all.

05:09:00.359 --> 05:09:08.966
Title IV, Part B, the 21st Century Community Learning Centers, and Title V, Part B, Subpart II, Rural and Low-Income School Program.

05:09:09.487 --> 05:09:16.873
These sections received very little stakeholder feedback and aren't subject to peer review, so they haven't changed at all since May.

05:09:19.892 --> 05:09:27.860
The CDE received quite a bit of feedback regarding the assessment section of the plan, mostly about the California Spanish Assessment, or CSA.

05:09:28.801 --> 05:09:42.996
Stakeholders generally support the idea of assessments in multiple languages to support bilingual programs, and some stakeholders would like to see primary language assessments included in the accountability system, but others expressed some concerns about over-testing.

05:09:44.437 --> 05:09:59.584
In response to stakeholder feedback, the August draft contains additional language signaling intent to get direction from you regarding the use of a valid and reliable CSA in the accountability system as that test is developed and comes online.

05:10:02.242 --> 05:10:14.492
One of, I think, the most gratifying things I heard, I'm not going to talk about stakeholder feedback, but during phase four, we asked folks, what should happen if schools aren't making the improvements we'd like them to make?

05:10:15.032 --> 05:10:18.455
And one of the things we heard most from stakeholders that was really wonderful to hear

05:10:19.676 --> 05:10:26.243
There's a really strong interest in rewarding progress towards goals rather than punishing lack of progress.

05:10:26.883 --> 05:10:33.390
We heard from folks that they liked the all applicable indicators option to identify the lowest performing schools.

05:10:33.990 --> 05:10:43.119
And we had a lot of conversation about that 95% participation requirement for the assessments and whether or not the icon was sufficient or not.

05:10:43.760 --> 05:10:56.252
People gave us a lot of different ideas about how to address that 95% participation requirement and how to really use that as an opportunity to help people understand more about the importance of testing.

05:10:57.253 --> 05:11:05.761
And people had a lot of different opinions around whether it should be a five-year goal or a seven-year goal, kind of a split on that.

05:11:07.321 --> 05:11:11.650
So here are the revisions that were made to the plan based on that stakeholder feedback.

05:11:12.251 --> 05:11:17.221
The plan reflects the all applicable indicators option for identifying the lowest performing 5% of schools.

05:11:20.759 --> 05:11:28.806
It talks about making sure that the identification of schools is tied to the identification of districts in the LCFF-based system.

05:11:29.547 --> 05:11:38.976
We now have a plan that reflects our intent to use multiple icons to report assessment participation rate, different icons for different reasons.

05:11:39.056 --> 05:11:41.158
Perhaps we're not meeting the participation rate.

05:11:41.999 --> 05:11:47.330
And the long-term goal has been set at high status and maintained for change.

05:11:47.871 --> 05:11:51.740
And the timeline for meeting long-term goals has been set at seven years.

05:11:54.623 --> 05:11:59.848
Stakeholders were very interested in providing feedback on the school support and improvement section of the plan.

05:12:00.468 --> 05:12:06.234
And as we just heard, people would really like to have more information about how this is all going to work together.

05:12:06.794 --> 05:12:08.716
What are the roles of the collaborative?

05:12:09.216 --> 05:12:11.538
What are the roles of the County Office of Education?

05:12:12.019 --> 05:12:14.921
How does the CDE, Superintendent of Public Instruction, fit in?

05:12:14.941 --> 05:12:16.383
We heard that a lot from folks.

05:12:16.883 --> 05:12:37.195
People wanted more information around the resource allocation review and monitoring, and they felt strongly about detailed needs analyses being conducted for identified schools to help identify root causes and how that should be done collaboratively, much as LCF, our LCAPs are developed collaboratively with district schools and community.

05:12:38.115 --> 05:12:42.437
There was good support for a regional support system using best practices.

05:12:43.918 --> 05:12:53.263
And this notion of really identifying best practices and systems that are making gains to help people to learn from one another and creating of networks.

05:12:54.793 --> 05:13:16.198
So, in response to that feedback, we do have, in the August draft, a more complete description of California's statewide system of support with more information around the specific activities and supports at those three levels that have been identified for our system of support, foundational, differentiated, and intensive intervention levels.

05:13:16.779 --> 05:13:18.119
There is more information.

05:13:18.219 --> 05:13:22.040
Obviously, we're still working out details, but there is more information in the plan.

05:13:22.640 --> 05:13:30.362
around the roles of each one of the statutorily required to provide support agencies and how they will work with one another and the field.

05:13:31.682 --> 05:13:42.365
There are more details around resource allocation review and monitoring, and there is a commitment in the plan around conducting local needs analyses to determine root causes.

05:13:45.199 --> 05:13:55.408
The next section, the access to educators section, when we went out and talked to folks about it, they wanted more clarity around the definitions in that section.

05:13:56.328 --> 05:14:00.432
We had proposed to talk about the ineffective teacher requirement later.

05:14:00.892 --> 05:14:04.775
Stakeholders felt pretty strongly that we should address it sooner rather than later.

05:14:07.546 --> 05:14:32.578
strong support for aligning those definitions to our LCFF state priorities, really taking it and making sure that priority one is really what drives how we look at access to educators, really clarify the distinction, make sure that those definitions are clear, and then to note flexibility afforded to charter schools around the definitions.

05:14:33.078 --> 05:14:45.378
People also wanted to be really clear that this statewide or that the educator equity supports would happen within the context of the statewide system of support, not be a separate set of supports outside of the larger system.

05:14:47.000 --> 05:14:57.723
So as you look at the August draft, you'll see that that has been, you know, we talked about it in July, but you'll see that that feedback has been taken into account.

05:14:58.284 --> 05:15:08.347
The working definition for ineffective teacher that was really focused on LCFF priority one, aligning with the guiding principle to develop a single coherent system.

05:15:09.287 --> 05:15:18.097
Really using credentialing statuses, school and district data for credentialing statuses, kind of basis of how we were going to meet that federal requirement.

05:15:19.018 --> 05:15:23.242
Talk about how that will continue to evolve as the state system of support evolves.

05:15:23.763 --> 05:15:30.130
And also creating very clearly stating that charter schools have flexibility around these definitions.

05:15:32.418 --> 05:15:40.427
The next two sections of the plan, the school conditions and school transition sections of the plan, were augmented relatively substantially.

05:15:40.947 --> 05:15:54.282
We found that these were two areas where stakeholders had a lot to say, and certainly when we went back and looked at the peer review criteria, we wanted to make sure that we were answering those prompts as completely and thoroughly as we could.

05:15:54.938 --> 05:16:08.903
So when we went out and talked to people about the school condition section, people wanted to have more information about the school conditions and climate work group in there, their recommendations, what are they doing, how they're going to be coming up with different surveys.

05:16:09.623 --> 05:16:14.605
And people encouraged us to look more clearly at exactly what that prompt

05:16:15.935 --> 05:16:18.497
was calling for, which was pretty explicit.

05:16:18.597 --> 05:16:21.819
How is the state going to reduce incidents of bullying and harassment?

05:16:22.239 --> 05:16:27.542
How is the state going to reduce overuse of discipline practices that remove students from the classroom?

05:16:27.962 --> 05:16:33.825
How is the state going to reduce the use of aversive behavioral interventions that compromise student health and safety?

05:16:34.706 --> 05:16:39.088
So we went back into the plan, and people also wanted more

05:16:41.249 --> 05:16:42.830
reference to parent engagement strategies.

05:16:42.871 --> 05:16:46.374
That's something that we've been working on for a long time here in California.

05:16:46.414 --> 05:16:48.936
How do we engage our community members and parent members?

05:16:49.537 --> 05:16:59.846
So as you look at that section of the plan, you'll see that it now has information about both the school conditions and climate work group and the ad hoc family engagement work group.

05:17:00.891 --> 05:17:20.596
And I won't read them all off, but there's a lot of information around a number of key resources and strategies that California already does, California already supports, California already has, and they will be leveraged within the system of support.

05:17:25.211 --> 05:17:34.780
School transitions, folks wanted a little bit more highlighting around the career technical education and career pathways and how that will all fit in with the dashboard indicators.

05:17:36.101 --> 05:17:38.083
People wanted more information about middle school.

05:17:38.643 --> 05:17:40.605
We're one of those states that doesn't really have middle.

05:17:40.625 --> 05:17:43.728
We don't focus on middle school as much as some other states do.

05:17:43.808 --> 05:17:44.809
It's part of our curriculum.

05:17:45.752 --> 05:17:48.175
Sometimes K-8, sometimes no.

05:17:48.476 --> 05:17:50.438
People wanted to hear more about middle school.

05:17:50.458 --> 05:17:52.460
Certainly the application calls for that.

05:17:53.361 --> 05:18:01.671
Folks wanted to talk more about early education and how early education transitions to the K-12 or TK-12 system.

05:18:04.154 --> 05:18:09.638
and suggested more data sharing and partnerships between high schools and colleges.

05:18:10.299 --> 05:18:20.306
So as you look at the school transition section of the plan, you'll note that there is quite a bit more information about the work underway to promote and expand student access to CTE and career pathways.

05:18:20.886 --> 05:18:24.089
We've added information around the career college indicator.

05:18:25.699 --> 05:18:31.283
We've added information about the LCAP addendum requirements in folks' local plans.

05:18:31.343 --> 05:18:39.410
They will need to talk about how they are supporting those transitions between early ed and or elementary and middle and high.

05:18:40.310 --> 05:18:44.373
We've got more information about there about how we support middle school transitions.

05:18:44.874 --> 05:18:48.036
And this I think was very important to our early education community.

05:18:49.278 --> 05:18:53.163
The plan refers to P-12 system wherever appropriate.

05:18:53.844 --> 05:19:00.594
So in this section in particular, but you'll see that sprinkled throughout the plan as appropriate to address the various prompts.

05:19:02.881 --> 05:19:08.023
didn't get a lot of feedback on the education of migratory children section, Title I-C.

05:19:08.783 --> 05:19:18.568
But people did ask for more details around how the needs of migratory students would be identified and what the outcomes for them would be.

05:19:19.228 --> 05:19:26.471
And handily enough, the comprehensive needs assessment, which was finished,

05:19:27.131 --> 05:19:30.532
in time to be folded into the August draft of the plan.

05:19:31.073 --> 05:19:39.976
So there's more information in there precisely on identifying the needs of migratory students and measurable program objectives and outcomes.

05:19:43.109 --> 05:20:03.570
Another program didn't get too much feedback, but we did get feedback on Title 1D, more information about how county offices support this work, more information about providing transition services for students integrating back into schools, and there was just sort of a lot of questions about what is Title 1D.

05:20:04.591 --> 05:20:11.379
So we, because it's not something that everyone has, or everyone applies for and uses.

05:20:11.559 --> 05:20:22.252
So, some revisions made to this section of the plan, more information regarding the work of county offices, and a little more detail around the purposes and uses of this funding.

05:20:24.119 --> 05:20:26.620
On to Title II, Supporting Effective Instruction.

05:20:27.080 --> 05:20:31.062
This was a section for which we received quite a bit of feedback.

05:20:31.142 --> 05:20:40.405
In the May draft, there was some good intention, but people in general just were like, we need a little bit more detail about what you're going to do.

05:20:41.846 --> 05:20:46.929
We want to know more about what you're going to do around the supporting school leaders, that optional 3% set aside.

05:20:46.949 --> 05:20:53.714
I think the May draft signaled our intention to reserve those funds, but didn't really talk about what we were going to do with them.

05:20:54.775 --> 05:21:02.260
There was a lot of conversation across the state about the importance of supporting educators to provide well-rounded education opportunities.

05:21:03.446 --> 05:21:12.078
People called out the quality professional learning standards, said, we have these, why don't we include them in our plan as a frame for our professional learning supports?

05:21:12.919 --> 05:21:21.290
And a number of stakeholders wanted us to specifically call out supports for our California subject matter projects.

05:21:23.072 --> 05:21:26.813
So as you look at the August draft, you'll see much more detail in that section.

05:21:26.833 --> 05:21:37.297
It now references all the state board adopted standards, just because we are committed to a well-rounded, rich education for our students.

05:21:37.377 --> 05:21:39.458
So I think that's helpful.

05:21:39.778 --> 05:21:48.181
And it does reference now the quality professional learning standards as an important frame for the types of professional learning that we will provide.

05:21:49.421 --> 05:22:02.204
We do have more information around that 3% set aside about the objectives, the kind of a broad frame, but more information around how we plan to build out supports for school leaders.

05:22:02.764 --> 05:22:08.606
We specifically commit to using Title II Part A funds to support the California subject matter projects.

05:22:09.386 --> 05:22:19.952
And we commit to using Title II Part A funds to build the capacity of districts to address their access and equity issues within the statewide system of support.

05:22:21.198 --> 05:22:23.579
And there is more specificity.

05:22:23.659 --> 05:22:27.542
We went back and looked at the peer review criteria and the prompt.

05:22:28.442 --> 05:22:38.267
Well, there's no peer review criteria for Title II, but again, in keeping with completeness, we looked at the prompt and it wanted to know, how are you meeting the needs of these specific groups of kids?

05:22:38.327 --> 05:22:47.032
So we got a little less broad and a little more here, some specific resources and strategies the state employs to meet the needs of these specific groups of kids.

05:22:47.753 --> 05:22:48.113
Bless you.

05:22:50.444 --> 05:22:55.807
Title III, we heard a lot about standardization of entry and exit criteria.

05:22:55.827 --> 05:22:58.769
We had a lot of conversations about that.

05:22:58.809 --> 05:23:06.733
For the most part, people are very supportive of waiting for new reclassification procedures until after the LPAC is implemented.

05:23:09.253 --> 05:23:10.134
We got feedback.

05:23:10.234 --> 05:23:17.461
This is another place where folks wanted to see more coordination of early education programs with the TK-12 system.

05:23:17.601 --> 05:23:19.643
So we did do that.

05:23:20.284 --> 05:23:25.889
And more professional development and resources for teachers and administrators around supporting English learners.

05:23:25.909 --> 05:23:28.612
This is something California does quite well.

05:23:28.952 --> 05:23:30.874
People wanted to see that in the plan.

05:23:31.955 --> 05:23:42.966
So the revisions made, we did provide in the August draft more specificity around the availability of additional tools, toolkits, and guidance documents to support English learners.

05:23:43.526 --> 05:23:48.391
And we did change, we included preschool to serve a P-12 system.

05:23:50.613 --> 05:23:53.736
Title IV, Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants.

05:23:55.508 --> 05:23:58.792
In general, people tell us more about what you're going to do.

05:23:59.352 --> 05:24:02.095
And if we have Title IV, we're going to need some more guidance.

05:24:02.176 --> 05:24:03.637
Can you tell us about that guidance?

05:24:04.478 --> 05:24:09.965
So what it says in the August draft now is it reflects your July motion.

05:24:10.645 --> 05:24:16.874
to have the local education agency sub-grant funding distributed via formula.

05:24:17.294 --> 05:24:28.509
That was a decision you made back in July, and it says that we anticipate you to discuss what to do with the state-level activity funds at this meeting today, because that's something we didn't get to in July.

05:24:30.436 --> 05:24:36.058
And our last program, McKinney-Vento Education for Homeless Children and Youth Program.

05:24:37.238 --> 05:24:58.104
Folks wanted to hear more about homeless preschoolers and what kinds of supports we have for preschoolers who are homeless, more information around how we identify and track homeless children and youth, more information about the types of professional learning opportunities that are available for educators to support homeless children and youth, more guidance,

05:24:59.557 --> 05:25:10.582
And so in response to all of that feedback, we have added actions and details regarding how do we heighten awareness around homeless preschool children?

05:25:10.942 --> 05:25:13.623
How do we do data and reporting on these children?

05:25:13.963 --> 05:25:15.724
What kinds of opportunities are available?

05:25:16.064 --> 05:25:20.806
You'll see in general, we were pretty responsive to the feedback for that section as well.

05:25:23.827 --> 05:25:25.928
So that's the August draft.

05:25:26.949 --> 05:25:37.716
When we put the draft in the memo on August 8th, we encouraged stakeholders to send feedback on the draft to the ESSA office for inclusion in the September ESSA item.

05:25:39.378 --> 05:25:45.902
And this table on the screen presents a summary of the feedback that we received by August 25th.

05:25:46.402 --> 05:25:48.544
Perhaps it was 28th, which was the Monday.

05:25:48.724 --> 05:25:50.085
Give people a little wiggle room.

05:25:52.193 --> 05:25:57.484
As you can see, we received nearly 200 emails from the visual and performing arts education community.

05:25:59.589 --> 05:26:00.270
And we loved them.

05:26:01.543 --> 05:26:07.184
Most of these communications were form letters requesting that arts education be highlighted more often in the plan.

05:26:08.184 --> 05:26:17.226
We received another 146 communications, again, mostly form letters from stakeholders who objected to the definition of ineffective teacher in the August draft.

05:26:17.866 --> 05:26:27.988
These communications expressed concern that intern teachers would be considered ineffective under the definition in the draft and that this might have implications for California's teacher shortage.

05:26:29.500 --> 05:26:36.302
We received a handful of communications on other topics, generally falling into two categories.

05:26:37.123 --> 05:26:43.185
Stakeholders who thought the plan could better highlight specific programs, requirements, and activities.

05:26:43.745 --> 05:26:49.547
And stakeholders who had remaining concerns around the accountability system and the system of support.

05:26:51.567 --> 05:26:53.028
Mostly just wanting to know more.

05:26:55.549 --> 05:27:01.813
So based on this feedback, the CDE proposes an attachment to two revisions to the August draft.

05:27:02.474 --> 05:27:06.537
First, we recommend a change to the definition of curriculum frameworks in the plan glossary.

05:27:06.557 --> 05:27:09.218
That's on page four of the draft.

05:27:10.299 --> 05:27:15.503
We also recommend changing some language in the access to educators section on page 51 of the draft.

05:27:18.385 --> 05:27:26.353
And beyond the stakeholder feedback, we recommend that you revisit the conversation around the Title IV Part A state-level activity funds.

05:27:26.894 --> 05:27:35.663
Recall we had that conversation regarding how to distribute the LEA subgrant at the July meeting, but we didn't determine how to use the state-level activity funds.

05:27:36.243 --> 05:27:40.768
So I'll cover each of these very briefly, and then we'll pause for questions.

05:27:43.123 --> 05:27:44.845
So first, the definition.

05:27:45.485 --> 05:27:59.197
The August draft references the core curriculum areas as defined in the California Education Code and discusses board adoption of frameworks in those four core areas of math, English language, arts, science, and history, social science.

05:28:00.410 --> 05:28:06.418
But as you know, the board adopts curriculum frameworks in subjects beyond the four core curriculum areas.

05:28:07.179 --> 05:28:17.812
So we propose to signal the state's support for a well-rounded education by updating this definition to include all of the content areas for which the board has adopted frameworks.

05:28:24.192 --> 05:28:33.340
The ineffective teacher definition in the August draft was developed to align with LCFF priority one and references teachers who are appropriately assigned and fully credentialed.

05:28:34.021 --> 05:28:45.491
This language raised concerns from stakeholders regarding intern teachers and the potential to exacerbate California's teacher shortage of this group of teachers is included in the ineffective teachers category.

05:28:46.191 --> 05:28:49.114
Some CPAC members also expressed this concern.

05:28:50.529 --> 05:29:00.391
Staff recommends revising this section of the plan to focus on whether teachers are misassigned or teaching without a credential, removing references to the full credential.

05:29:05.692 --> 05:29:08.072
On to Title IV state-level activity funds.

05:29:08.433 --> 05:29:12.033
So here's another fabulous graphic.

05:29:12.313 --> 05:29:15.454
As you can see, as with most federal money,

05:29:17.177 --> 05:29:19.418
Whenever I talk about money, member Burr perks up.

05:29:19.478 --> 05:29:20.258
What you got on there?

05:29:23.220 --> 05:29:25.260
These are really small amounts of money.

05:29:25.280 --> 05:29:45.809
You're really gonna... As you can see in this graphic, as with most federal money, the bulk goes to local education agencies and a small amount, in the case of Title IV Part A, 1%, is held at the state for administration of those funds.

05:29:47.264 --> 05:29:53.695
For Title IV Part A, 4% of California's allocation, roughly $1.9 million.

05:29:54.296 --> 05:29:59.265
The gray segments on this chart can be used for state-level activity money.

05:30:01.437 --> 05:30:18.980
At the July meeting, you determined that the LEA subgrants would be distributed via formula, and these local funds will be used for well-rounded education activities, and there are a great number of them listed in the statute, safe and healthy student activities, and activities that promote the effective use of technology.

05:30:20.000 --> 05:30:29.322
The state will use the roughly $460,000 of administration funds to distribute and monitor the local use of funds.

05:30:31.516 --> 05:30:41.449
The state activity funds can be used in accordance with SS section 4104B, which is coming up on the next slide, or they may be transferred to another program.

05:30:42.170 --> 05:30:47.317
It should be noted that Title IV Part A funds are subject to federal equitable services requirements.

05:30:48.078 --> 05:31:03.492
Per ESSA statute, before a state or local education agency transfers funds from a program subject to equitable services requirements, it must engage in timely and meaningful consultation with the appropriate private school officials.

05:31:03.632 --> 05:31:05.314
So that's something just to bear in mind.

05:31:05.794 --> 05:31:12.721
If you elect to transfer these funds to another program, the state will need to conduct consultation with private school officials first.

05:31:16.300 --> 05:31:24.069
So here's section 4104B from the ESSA, the uses of state activities funds under law for Title IV.

05:31:24.749 --> 05:31:32.738
As you can see, leaving these funds in Title IV would permit the state to go beyond simply monitoring the funds.

05:31:33.820 --> 05:31:40.584
to providing training, technical assistance, capacity building activities to support local implementation of Title IV-A.

05:31:41.304 --> 05:31:50.529
ESSA and LCFF share that commitment to supporting a well-rounded education for all students and to supporting the whole child through improving school conditions for student learning.

05:31:51.649 --> 05:32:07.358
And as some would be quick to say, $1.9 million is not a huge amount of money relative to California's total annual education budget, but it would permit the state to support the type of school climate activities that many Californians believe are at the heart of student success.

05:32:09.039 --> 05:32:16.404
Title IV funds may also be used to support the implementation of state standards if you elect to leave them in Title IV.

05:32:16.464 --> 05:32:18.705
I know that's a big priority for our work.

05:32:20.040 --> 05:32:23.762
So with that, I'm going to take a breath.

05:32:25.022 --> 05:32:29.164
These are the three proposed revisions contained in attachment two of the item.

05:32:29.665 --> 05:32:40.830
This is a good place to pause for questions or discussion before moving on to the revisions that are not presented in the item.

05:32:42.322 --> 05:32:43.423
You want to pause now then?

05:32:43.603 --> 05:32:43.823
All right.

05:32:43.883 --> 05:32:44.944
Let's have our first pause.

05:32:44.964 --> 05:32:46.004
We'll have another pause.

05:32:47.045 --> 05:32:52.689
I just wanted to address a couple of things on the substantive changes.

05:32:52.729 --> 05:33:00.173
So I do appreciate the change to be inclusive of all the frameworks that the State Board has adopted.

05:33:00.193 --> 05:33:05.417
I think that is, again, our commitment to having a broad course of study.

05:33:05.437 --> 05:33:06.838
And then also the

05:33:09.319 --> 05:33:14.663
So on the ineffective teacher piece of it, that was the item that had the second most comments on it.

05:33:15.024 --> 05:33:26.813
So the state's LCFF priority reflects the state's preference that every teacher is well prepared by way of earning a full credential and who is appropriately assigned.

05:33:27.393 --> 05:33:34.458
I think we all know, also all recognize that a full credential does not equate whether a teacher is

05:33:35.379 --> 05:33:37.280
effective or ineffective.

05:33:37.700 --> 05:33:48.107
And for that type of determination, we need additional data points and information, including the local context, as many of our stakeholder feedback has pointed out.

05:33:49.067 --> 05:33:56.872
Nevertheless, we're required to respond to the state plan template that defines ESSA's ineffective label, which is a negative frame.

05:33:58.513 --> 05:34:05.441
and which could mischaracterize or even malign anyone who's working towards earning a full credential.

05:34:06.142 --> 05:34:16.895
We have several types of credentials in California, including CTE, preliminary, interim credentials, which are perfectly valid for the positions for which those teachers hold.

05:34:17.515 --> 05:34:21.558
Therefore, I support the change that we have made.

05:34:22.698 --> 05:34:30.943
And I think that is that the change we've made to drop the word full from the credential.

05:34:31.964 --> 05:34:43.671
Additionally, just want to reiterate one more time and confirm charter schools flexibility under California law for teachers who teach a non-core, non-college preparatory courses and confirm that the teachers

05:34:44.591 --> 05:34:49.313
under this charter option are not considered ineffective under the state plan.

05:34:53.095 --> 05:34:54.475
Okay, any other comments?

05:34:55.215 --> 05:34:56.296
Board Member Rucker, next.

05:34:58.354 --> 05:35:12.544
Okay, so I'm going to begin by picking up where Board Member Sung left off, but I do want to say both the May board meeting and the July board meeting were really emotional meetings for me when we had this conversation on this item.

05:35:12.925 --> 05:35:19.830
And I want to tell you, I want to thank the staff and all of the groups that worked on and dipped their spoons

05:35:20.410 --> 05:35:28.372
into the pot and stirred up the pot to create this draft because it is significantly and qualitatively better.

05:35:28.832 --> 05:35:30.553
And I do appreciate that.

05:35:30.573 --> 05:35:32.033
I want to begin by saying that.

05:35:32.873 --> 05:35:39.135
As it relates to the issue about ineffective teachers, I'm a real stickler for terms of art.

05:35:39.515 --> 05:35:43.716
So when it comes to the intern, the piece of paper,

05:35:44.136 --> 05:35:46.520
that puts interns in the classroom.

05:35:46.940 --> 05:35:51.607
Is that called a permit, an authorization, a certificate, a credential?

05:35:52.008 --> 05:36:00.280
We want to make sure we're saying what it is because we don't want to call it a credential if it really is a type or category

05:36:00.640 --> 05:36:02.241
of state certification.

05:36:02.701 --> 05:36:20.672
So, when you are making this particular revision, if you could simply say appropriately, have the appropriate state certification rather than appropriate state credential if the intern certificate, if the intern paper is not actually called a credential, I would ask you to check on that.

05:36:21.313 --> 05:36:28.417
The other piece, and I know we don't, that's not something that was really covered as well as we would like to do,

05:36:28.977 --> 05:36:33.340
on the issue of teacher effectiveness is also the issue of distribution.

05:36:33.680 --> 05:36:45.528
There's a clear intent that students who work in particular schools are not taught, you know, have the same opportunity to be taught by well-trained and well-qualified teachers.

05:36:46.108 --> 05:36:57.334
And so there is this issue of the distribution question because interns tend to be placed collectively and as a class in a particular class of schools.

05:36:57.755 --> 05:37:09.161
And so the thing that our plan does not really address is how districts would be held accountable for the distribution and placement decisions that they make with these interns.

05:37:09.541 --> 05:37:14.524
That's not a conversation we can have here, but that does go a little bit further

05:37:14.904 --> 05:37:19.245
with the work that I hope will happen on the accountability side of the LCAP.

05:37:19.606 --> 05:37:22.707
Because the problem is not that we have intern teachers.

05:37:23.047 --> 05:37:23.887
Let's be clear.

05:37:24.247 --> 05:37:30.789
An intern teacher is just as qualified as a first-year teacher who graduated last week from UC Davis.

05:37:30.909 --> 05:37:32.870
I graduated from Davis, by the way.

05:37:33.870 --> 05:37:36.672
So, they're just as qualified because they know just as much.

05:37:37.072 --> 05:37:40.394
Teaching is not something you spend a year in college learning to do.

05:37:40.734 --> 05:37:45.376
That is a skill that you develop and grow into over time.

05:37:45.716 --> 05:38:02.365
So, we can accept that idea, but the fact is, interns tend to be collectively placed at some of the lowest performing schools, at some of the hardest to staff schools, in some of the hardest to teach subjects, and with students who would be considered

05:38:02.865 --> 05:38:04.187
our priority students.

05:38:04.587 --> 05:38:12.937
And so the plan still does not really address how we will deal with distribution decisions that frankly districts make that are poor.

05:38:13.318 --> 05:38:21.888
But I am hoping through the LCAP processes, those are going to be the schools that I'm quite certain will be identified for intervention

05:38:22.308 --> 05:38:28.932
And I'm hoping the county, this is one of those hard questions that I did not want to, I was holding off until this item.

05:38:29.272 --> 05:38:40.239
This is one of those hard questions that I didn't hear any county offices bringing up that they were going to discuss because that's the reason why some of the underperforming schools they have in their county are underperforming.

05:38:40.519 --> 05:38:44.041
And I want to know what agency they have to tell districts cut that crap out.

05:38:44.461 --> 05:38:49.524
So those are the kinds of things and hard conversations we have to have in a different venue.

05:38:50.871 --> 05:38:59.039
The other thing that I want to say really relates to what approving this board item means.

05:38:59.060 --> 05:39:06.727
There's a couple of other things in the action, in the recommendations you're making for action that I think need to be clarified.

05:39:07.768 --> 05:39:12.814
As part of the process of developing the state plan, we previously approved a transition plan.

05:39:14.093 --> 05:39:24.558
And as part of that transition, approving this board item means we then suspend or even nullify the work that's been going on in districts to implement that transition plan.

05:39:24.598 --> 05:39:26.339
That needs to be clear, I'm hoping.

05:39:26.960 --> 05:39:33.403
And then for schools that were in certain stages of program improvement or corrective action,

05:39:33.923 --> 05:39:49.816
The state in their transition plan spelled out what the ongoing work districts were supposed to be doing while the transition plan was in place and up to and until the state's ESSA plan was approved by board action.

05:39:50.296 --> 05:39:55.439
So, is approving this state plan going to suspend that work as well?

05:39:55.819 --> 05:40:06.685
I think that needs to be clarified because districts with schools, districts and schools that are in some form of program improvement or corrective action whose status is frozen.

05:40:07.659 --> 05:40:11.701
and they were supposed to continue planning and continue developing capacity.

05:40:12.381 --> 05:40:16.803
Once this state plan is approved, what are they supposed to be doing with that work?

05:40:17.223 --> 05:40:19.324
And what is their new status now?

05:40:19.724 --> 05:40:23.346
So, approving this state plan has an impact on those things.

05:40:23.886 --> 05:40:31.609
I think we need to make sure we clarify what our vote to approve this plan will mean as it relates to those two things.

05:40:35.191 --> 05:40:35.451
Okay.

05:40:38.018 --> 05:40:39.460
Don't, no need to respond to that?

05:40:40.020 --> 05:40:47.428
Well, my understanding and I know that Carrick and his team have been having conversations about how we transition program improvement into

05:40:48.561 --> 05:40:50.222
the non-program improvement era.

05:40:50.822 --> 05:41:01.128
My understanding of the transition plan that you approved, I believe, in May of 2016, was that that plan was for the 16-17 transition year.

05:41:01.568 --> 05:41:05.871
And ESSA is in effect for the 17-18 transition year.

05:41:06.371 --> 05:41:08.292
And I could look over my show.

05:41:08.572 --> 05:41:08.813
Yes?

05:41:09.773 --> 05:41:10.594
I'm counting too.

05:41:11.634 --> 05:41:23.582
So I don't know if you, have you, have we determined with conviction about the status of program improvement for this, which is clearly another transition year.

05:41:23.622 --> 05:41:25.323
Last year was the last year of NCLB.

05:41:25.763 --> 05:41:35.610
We are without, whether or not you all approve, ED hasn't approved, so I would offer that there's another kind of transition in there until ED approves.

05:41:36.584 --> 05:41:37.064
No.

05:41:37.465 --> 05:41:38.225
Well, no.

05:41:38.786 --> 05:41:55.818
My understanding in our action was that transition plan and the guidance that I read from ED said that that transition plan was in place until the state submitted their approved state plan, that they didn't have to wait on what they were going to do on that part.

05:41:55.838 --> 05:42:02.342
So that's why I'm saying our action has an impact on two other decisions the board has made.

05:42:02.723 --> 05:42:04.344
I want to make sure we're clear.

05:42:04.995 --> 05:42:08.278
on how that action relates to that transition plan.

05:42:08.319 --> 05:42:11.882
So we're not taking, so that people are not... No, it's important.

05:42:12.243 --> 05:42:12.623
I agree.

05:42:15.826 --> 05:42:16.547
Ortiz Lacombe.

05:42:17.711 --> 05:42:19.292
Ting, I don't know if you were going to point this out.

05:42:19.312 --> 05:42:25.097
There was two revisions that I suggested, and I know that we have them in front of us.

05:42:25.577 --> 05:42:31.802
One of them, page 29, included under the LPI baseline.

05:42:31.822 --> 05:42:32.542
Are you going to cover that?

05:42:32.582 --> 05:42:32.742
Yes.

05:42:33.223 --> 05:42:40.008
Right after this little pause for these three, we're going to go into the next three that weren't in the item, but were the ones that you suggested.

05:42:40.327 --> 05:42:44.289
Okay, so then those we have them and you'll describe them.

05:42:44.789 --> 05:42:56.674
I also asked staff to look into incorporating specifically calling out the EL roadmap under Title 3 in discussing developing resources for LEAs to support ELs.

05:42:57.154 --> 05:43:01.997
And so I know that staff will be working on some language and bringing that forward for the final motion as well.

05:43:02.557 --> 05:43:02.837
Thank you.

05:43:05.285 --> 05:43:07.706
So you want to include those in your next part?

05:43:08.146 --> 05:43:12.148
I'm a little lost as to why we're pausing now and having board discussion.

05:43:12.568 --> 05:43:13.268
I apologize.

05:43:14.449 --> 05:43:17.450
We had an item that had these three proposed revisions.

05:43:18.590 --> 05:43:21.191
We also need to talk about the Title IV question.

05:43:23.487 --> 05:43:35.234
And I thought rather than having those three revisions, which people have had a chance to really look at since the item was posted, and then go into these smaller, less substantive conversations afterwards.

05:43:36.135 --> 05:43:41.798
Because the next set are kind of corrections as opposed to things that require big decisions.

05:43:45.220 --> 05:43:47.781
I'm happy to continue and then have more conversation later.

05:43:47.801 --> 05:43:48.802
Let's bring it all out.

05:43:48.962 --> 05:43:49.202
Yeah.

05:43:49.242 --> 05:43:49.462
Sure.

05:43:49.963 --> 05:43:50.203
Okay.

05:43:50.714 --> 05:43:51.956
Just trying to parse it out.

05:43:52.517 --> 05:43:54.760
So here are additional suggested revisions.

05:43:56.182 --> 05:44:03.252
I want to share with you a few revisions that were not presented in the item, but I think everyone in the room has the handout now that has them.

05:44:03.352 --> 05:44:05.495
So we want to make sure we're getting very close to submission.

05:44:05.535 --> 05:44:07.578
So we want to be very clear on what it is we're proposing.

05:44:09.400 --> 05:44:14.624
Two of them are corrections to language in the plan that came to our attention after we posted the item.

05:44:15.064 --> 05:44:19.168
And the third proposes new language to address a new plan requirement.

05:44:19.828 --> 05:44:27.354
Because these revisions were not included in the item, we've prepared a handout so everyone can see very clearly what it is we're proposing.

05:44:31.676 --> 05:44:44.209
So on page 29, we propose to update the language to reflect the English learner progress indicator will be calculated using the number of reclassified English learners, not reclassification rates.

05:44:44.749 --> 05:44:52.297
So the top part of this slide, and you'll have it on your handout as well, shows these proposed revisions using the format that we've consistently used

05:44:52.717 --> 05:44:55.019
for updated drafts to ensure accessibility.

05:44:55.519 --> 05:44:56.861
But it's a little bit hard to read.

05:44:56.921 --> 05:45:01.745
So at the bottom of the slide, the new proposed language post-revision is provided.

05:45:02.585 --> 05:45:04.747
But you can see those on the handout.

05:45:04.767 --> 05:45:05.548
The first one says page 29.

05:45:08.917 --> 05:45:12.518
On page 39 of the draft, we propose one change.

05:45:13.279 --> 05:45:28.564
Schools graduating fewer than 67% of their students will be eligible for comprehensive supports in addition to the lowest performing 5% of schools, not within that 5% of schools.

05:45:29.044 --> 05:45:35.807
And since that's just one change and relatively legible, we didn't put the whole amended on this slide, but you do have it in your handout.

05:45:37.839 --> 05:45:43.718
And then we propose to add new language to the plan to address Appendix B.

05:45:47.665 --> 05:45:51.626
Appendix B is a relatively new addition to the plan template.

05:45:52.386 --> 05:46:00.268
On July 24, after your July meeting, ED released this new plan requirement for a 30-day public comment period.

05:46:01.028 --> 05:46:13.291
States must provide a written response to provide assurances that the state will ensure equitable access to and participation in its federally assisted programs for students, teachers, and others who may have special needs.

05:46:13.951 --> 05:46:22.257
Specifically, Section 427 of the General Education Provisions Act highlights six potential barriers to access and participation.

05:46:22.897 --> 05:46:27.780
Gender, race, national origin, color, disability, and age.

05:46:28.421 --> 05:46:35.085
The public comment for this new requirement ended on August 23rd, so this is all happening very recently.

05:46:36.386 --> 05:46:43.531
And we have not yet been officially notified by ED to include this appendix when we submit the plan next week.

05:46:44.352 --> 05:46:50.399
But it is part of the plan template that is currently posted on ED's webpage.

05:46:51.019 --> 05:46:56.626
And both our federal liaison in Washington and our colleagues at the Council of Chief State School Officers

05:46:57.099 --> 05:47:03.824
are confident that this new appendix will be required and that it would be best to submit it along with the rest of the plan.

05:47:05.105 --> 05:47:23.478
Fortunately, and this is an assurance primarily, California law provides established steps to ensure that students, teachers, and others in public schools are provided with equitable access to and participation in federally assisted programs, well, all programs.

05:47:24.418 --> 05:47:47.209
Under Section 200, all persons in public schools, regardless of disability, gender, gender identity, we go beyond the federal requirement, gender expression, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic contained in the definition of hate crimes, have equal rights and opportunities in the educational institutions in our state.

05:47:49.500 --> 05:47:51.401
I'm not going to read all of the relevant code.

05:47:51.441 --> 05:47:53.082
Again, you do have it in front of you.

05:47:54.523 --> 05:48:07.673
But section 250 requires any educational institution receiving state dollars to provide an assurance to the issuing agency that it will comply with the anti-discrimination provisions in this chapter of education code.

05:48:08.733 --> 05:48:17.638
And section 260 states that school district governing boards have primary responsibility for ensuring that programs and activities are free from discrimination.

05:48:18.378 --> 05:48:28.023
And section 262.3a describes the process for appealing to the CDE any actions that are taken at the local level.

05:48:29.063 --> 05:48:38.427
So, staff recommends that we revise the plan to include the relevant excerpts of education code as shown on these slides and on the handout.

05:48:38.987 --> 05:48:53.793
To be very clear, we are not proposing to provide any new language beyond what is provided on this handout, which is fundamentally a restatement of the requirement and the relevant excerpts of code.

05:48:54.793 --> 05:48:59.257
So those are the three that you did not see before today.

05:49:00.418 --> 05:49:01.618
And there's our recommendation.

05:49:01.678 --> 05:49:03.540
So I'm going to stop talking.

05:49:04.581 --> 05:49:05.742
And we're going to take a break.

05:49:07.343 --> 05:49:10.025
So let's come back at five at three.

05:49:15.489 --> 05:49:17.591
Okay, the board will reconvene and so

05:49:21.772 --> 05:49:28.577
The board will start then with board member questions and issues.

05:49:29.558 --> 05:49:31.319
Board Member Sun, do you want to begin?

05:49:31.619 --> 05:49:32.880
Yes, go ahead.

05:49:33.601 --> 05:49:36.003
Board Member Sun, our federal liaison will begin.

05:49:37.068 --> 05:49:41.672
OK, so just a couple of things before we go to public comment.

05:49:42.693 --> 05:50:00.770
I just wanted to well, first of all, I want to underline what board member Rucker said that around our continued work and commitment to the work on the LCAP regarding instructors and effective teachers in the classroom for all of California's students.

05:50:01.911 --> 05:50:14.702
And then just after the public comments, I will be making motion on the suggested some of the substantive changes as well as the technical changes.

05:50:15.362 --> 05:50:24.770
And in addition, regarding the E-English Language Learner Roadmap to be included in a section of the plan as well.

05:50:26.271 --> 05:50:26.611
Okay.

05:50:26.891 --> 05:50:28.813
So, Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

05:50:31.685 --> 05:50:38.470
So I want to acknowledge that the plan has come a very long way and there are certain areas that have been really strengthened.

05:50:38.890 --> 05:50:41.032
And that's not an endorsement, but it's an acknowledgement.

05:50:42.553 --> 05:50:43.614
I also have to say that.

05:50:43.814 --> 05:50:49.077
And I think I recognize the hours and the work that went into it.

05:50:49.538 --> 05:50:52.940
Putting together those stakeholder meetings is not an easy task.

05:50:52.980 --> 05:50:57.804
We know that many states have skipped out on that very important component because it is very labor intensive.

05:50:59.265 --> 05:51:03.309
You know, I want to go back to one thing that it will be of no surprise to anyone.

05:51:04.170 --> 05:51:09.515
When you mentioned that this is a grant application, I'm very acquainted with grant applications.

05:51:09.575 --> 05:51:15.401
I'm in the non-profit world, so I have to get very, I have to write these several times a month.

05:51:15.661 --> 05:51:19.265
And I also, we also sub-grant to some of our affiliates.

05:51:19.666 --> 05:51:21.467
So, I also know that process.

05:51:22.108 --> 05:51:35.952
I think part of the disconnect that I've had along this process for the last year and a half is that I don't see this only as a contract, only as a grant, because ESSA is rooted in civil rights.

05:51:36.352 --> 05:51:41.074
And I think that we need to make sure that we acknowledge that, even if we want to focus on the California way

05:51:41.654 --> 05:51:48.839
on LCFF, we need to acknowledge that this is rooted in civil rights because the rest of the country is already forgetting about civil rights.

05:51:49.219 --> 05:51:59.386
So it is our responsibility to say that even though it's only a small little green band, it's meant to bring equity and parity to students that have historically underperformed.

05:51:59.807 --> 05:52:07.552
And I think that perspective is what has shifted the conversation between where I stand and where maybe some others stand.

05:52:09.683 --> 05:52:33.824
And in the spirit of that, one of the things that has been a bit of a heartbreak for me is that we haven't addressed, not even at a minimum, in a minimum way for a grant, the notion of narrowing achievement gaps, the notion of setting interim growth targets, the notion of how will we accelerate the growth of those subgroups lagging furthest behind.

05:52:34.484 --> 05:52:39.951
And I don't think that if a reader or if I had received this grant, I would say, yes, they met.

05:52:40.171 --> 05:52:41.152
They checked that off.

05:52:41.472 --> 05:52:45.017
They wrote the basics of it because we didn't.

05:52:45.297 --> 05:52:50.783
What we said was we have this five by five and districts can use it or schools can use it.

05:52:52.585 --> 05:52:56.988
my last round of comments was, can we at least make that language stronger?

05:52:57.308 --> 05:52:58.849
Can we say will, shall?

05:52:59.470 --> 05:53:08.457
And it's been a year and a half where I've asked statewide methodology, let's say really concrete targets, to now just asking the basics.

05:53:08.517 --> 05:53:10.138
Can we just strengthen the language?

05:53:10.558 --> 05:53:12.940
And even that hasn't made it to this final version.

05:53:13.360 --> 05:53:13.520
So,

05:53:14.461 --> 05:53:19.344
I feel that because of that, we haven't addressed the question.

05:53:19.884 --> 05:53:26.507
And I said it before, it doesn't have to be here because I know how people feel about this contract.

05:53:26.848 --> 05:53:29.489
But it hasn't been codified anywhere else.

05:53:29.889 --> 05:53:34.592
You know, this plan will outlive all of us here and hopefully this administration in D.C.

05:53:34.652 --> 05:53:34.912
as well.

05:53:35.572 --> 05:53:37.313
because it won't be reauthorized.

05:53:37.333 --> 05:53:40.634
This bill, this law will not be reauthorized for another 10, 15 years.

05:53:41.135 --> 05:53:52.480
And so what we, our good intentions, because I know we all have them, won't matter if it's not documented somewhere that we committed to narrowing achievement gaps in California for California students.

05:53:53.260 --> 05:53:56.343
LCFF tells us that we should, but it doesn't tell us how.

05:53:56.703 --> 05:54:02.108
And I think that ESSA allowed that opportunity to say, and this is exactly how we're going to do that.

05:54:02.488 --> 05:54:04.210
So that continues to be a disappointment.

05:54:04.270 --> 05:54:09.494
And I'm sorry, I really apologize to folks that looked to me to help move this along.

05:54:09.514 --> 05:54:10.395
I wasn't able to.

05:54:10.835 --> 05:54:11.176
Thank you.

05:54:15.940 --> 05:54:20.203
Yeah, OK, we'll move to public comment.

05:54:30.168 --> 05:54:32.752
May we come back to that after the public comment?

05:54:33.434 --> 05:54:38.463
And if the staff is sure they understand what you're, what they need to answer, right?

05:54:39.605 --> 05:54:39.966
Okay.

05:54:40.206 --> 05:54:40.466
All right.

05:54:40.507 --> 05:54:41.488
We'll have public comment.

05:54:41.528 --> 05:54:41.809
That'll.

05:54:42.406 --> 05:54:44.227
Would the following people please line up?

05:54:44.627 --> 05:55:04.696
Tony Rice, Eric Premack, Shanti Ezrin, Celia Jaffe, Sorret Kaminski, Doug McCray, Enrique Rocho, Isamar Orcs Gonzalez, Edmundo Litton, Mary Perry, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz, Shelley Spiegel Coleman, Carla Herrera,

05:55:05.476 --> 05:55:13.252
Roberto Viramontes, Ashley Lautzenheiser, Kyle Hawker, and Michael McKibbin.

05:55:13.773 --> 05:55:15.116
I'll call other names in a moment.

05:55:21.345 --> 05:55:22.105
Go ahead, yeah.

05:55:22.425 --> 05:55:23.326
Thank you, Tony Rice.

05:55:24.006 --> 05:55:45.412
On behalf of the Regional Economic Association leaders, the REAL Coalition, an association of California's most influential business and economic development entities, representing 20 member organizations and up to 15,000 employers who collectively provide up to 3.9 million California jobs, we write this important concept, California's Every Student Succeeds Act State Plan presented today.

05:55:46.252 --> 05:56:00.785
ESSA recognizes that educational improvement will increase students' ability to succeed in the 21st century global economy, fostering such skills as critical thinking, complex problem solving, effective communication, collaboration, and the ability to learn independently in a rapidly changing world.

05:56:01.405 --> 05:56:12.271
California has designed a robust and meaningful set of indicators that stakeholders can use to drive performance over time, enabling our students to shape and own accountability and empower school districts to create cultures of leadership and performance.

05:56:12.731 --> 05:56:18.454
This will also encourage attracting, retaining, supporting, and unleashing an effective teacher and educated force.

05:56:18.534 --> 05:56:21.656
Thank you for your dedication to the development of our future workforce.

05:56:21.696 --> 05:56:26.499
We stand ready to work together to support a strong, excuse me, economically competitive California.

05:56:26.719 --> 05:56:26.979
Thank you.

05:56:32.739 --> 05:56:34.562
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

05:56:34.742 --> 05:56:40.670
We appreciate some of the changes, including a reference to charter flexibility under teacher credentialing.

05:56:41.291 --> 05:56:50.263
But given that we've had about a 10 year plus problem with CDE recognizing one of the key forms of flexibility with respect to assignment monitoring,

05:56:50.996 --> 05:56:56.722
The lack of specificity in the state plan on that issue remains a very serious issue to us.

05:56:57.303 --> 05:57:08.074
We will, if that's not addressed explicitly in the plan, we do plan to vigorously oppose its adoption and we would encourage you to amend the plan to reflect that specific flexibility.

05:57:08.706 --> 05:57:22.415
We also remain confused as to how the charter flexibility with respect to goal setting and the LCAP aligns with identifying the lowest 5% performing schools and whether we're going to align to the charter flexibility there.

05:57:23.395 --> 05:57:32.001
The federal law is quite explicit that these plans need to respect the state law flexibility accorded to charters and as it's currently drafted, as I interpret it,

05:57:33.302 --> 05:57:35.326
That flexibility is not there for charter.

05:57:35.386 --> 05:57:40.354
So we are very concerned about those and ask that you amend the plan to explicitly recognize those.

05:57:40.634 --> 05:57:40.915
Thank you.

05:57:46.883 --> 05:57:48.645
Celia Jaffe, State PTA.

05:57:49.827 --> 05:57:53.932
PTA supports the board's approach to the ESSA State Plan.

05:57:54.593 --> 05:58:01.322
We don't want the state's innovations in education to become limited or hedged in by federal requirements.

05:58:01.362 --> 05:58:03.505
We don't want the tail wagging the dog.

05:58:04.426 --> 05:58:13.530
CDE and the board have been very responsive to stakeholders and have changed things all along the way in the evolution of this system.

05:58:13.990 --> 05:58:20.934
And we'd rather come here to the state for changes and improvements rather than to the feds.

05:58:21.254 --> 05:58:23.335
So we're happy with this idea.

05:58:23.355 --> 05:58:32.639
The caveats are to stay true to the priority of pursuing equity and to the priority of continuous improvement of the system as a whole.

05:58:39.781 --> 05:58:47.347
So I want to start by saying thank you for recognizing that effective teachers come from all backgrounds, including intern teachers.

05:58:48.088 --> 05:58:49.709
I'm Isamar Ortiz-Gonzalez.

05:58:49.969 --> 05:58:54.393
I teach in Sacramento for Natomas Unified School District.

05:58:54.553 --> 05:58:57.476
This is my four year serving students in the classroom.

05:58:58.216 --> 05:58:59.857
And I started as an intern teacher.

05:59:00.698 --> 05:59:15.536
And so I just want, and knowing that the data says that close to half of intern teachers are the most diverse or come from the most diverse backgrounds, just wanted to reiterate that it's very important for teachers to reflect the background of our diverse students as well.

05:59:16.116 --> 05:59:27.905
And just a quick example, my first year as a Spanish teacher at an elementary school, teachers, students were at first very hesitant to admit that they spoke Spanish or were very unwilling to speak it.

05:59:28.025 --> 05:59:36.612
And then by my second year, a lot of them were proud just by the fact that they liked me and they thought it was cool that they could communicate in their native language, whether a teacher.

05:59:36.652 --> 05:59:37.873
So just a quick example.

05:59:38.633 --> 05:59:38.934
Thank you.

05:59:44.853 --> 05:59:45.414
Good afternoon.

05:59:45.454 --> 05:59:48.296
My name is Edmundo Litton from Loyola Marymount University.

05:59:48.776 --> 05:59:53.220
I'm a professor and my main responsibility is to run the intern programs at the university.

05:59:53.880 --> 06:00:03.127
So I support the state plan, which designates effective teachers as those who are properly assigned and are teaching with a credential, including an intern teaching credential.

06:00:03.668 --> 06:00:14.056
In the last 15 years, I have been truly honored to support many intern teachers as they serve the use of the state, especially during a time of a teacher shortage.

06:00:14.736 --> 06:00:21.721
With the support of the university and our employing districts, my interns have demonstrated that they are strong teachers.

06:00:22.382 --> 06:00:28.947
They work on a daily basis to make sure that every student has the ability to succeed under their care.

06:00:29.868 --> 06:00:38.374
Because intern programs have created the most diverse teaching force, our intern programs have also been able to become role models.

06:00:38.995 --> 06:00:41.317
Our teachers have become role models for our students.

06:00:42.037 --> 06:00:48.604
to say that my intern teachers are ineffective ignores the many successful outcomes I've worked with their students.

06:00:48.985 --> 06:00:49.265
Thank you.

06:00:57.776 --> 06:01:00.537
Good afternoon, Sean Tiezrin, Alliance for Children's Rights.

06:01:01.097 --> 06:01:09.619
I'm here to highlight the feedback and written public comment that we provided in partnership with the National Center for Youth Law with respect to foster youth and the state ESSA plan.

06:01:10.200 --> 06:01:21.263
In short, we were disappointed that the foster youth assurances under ESSA were not included in the state plan, particularly since foster youth continue to demonstrate the poorest educational outcomes of any student group in the state.

06:01:21.863 --> 06:01:35.116
However, we applaud the fact that the board is committed to consider additional policies that address ESSA requirements not covered by the state plan template and further align state and federal accountability requirements.

06:01:37.406 --> 06:01:50.855
The draft LCAP addendum is one such policy tool that offers a key opportunity to align federal accountability requirements related to foster youth with LEA's broader LCFF goals related to foster youth students.

06:01:51.416 --> 06:01:55.259
We suggest that including a prompt in the LCAP addendum related to school stability.

06:01:55.979 --> 06:02:01.242
The inclusion of this prompt will ensure that all LEAs are meeting the minimum requirements of both federal and state law.

06:02:01.482 --> 06:02:07.125
And furthermore, will support widespread implementation on the ground for one of California's highest need pupils.

06:02:07.866 --> 06:02:08.146
Thank you.

06:02:14.244 --> 06:02:27.131
Good afternoon, Enrique Rocha with the Los Angeles Unified School District and we would like to commend and appreciate the work of the board as it relates to the ESSA state plan and including the revisions on the ineffective teacher definition.

06:02:28.212 --> 06:02:41.260
As we would encourage the continued work on that definition and as the work moves beyond the ESSA state plan, we would urge the consideration of the ineffective teacher definition which

06:02:42.181 --> 06:02:52.956
We recommend that it should not include the misassigned teachers, which should be categorized as out-of-field teachers, and also to base that definition on teacher performance and evaluation.

06:02:53.176 --> 06:02:53.457
Thank you.

06:02:59.278 --> 06:02:59.939
Good afternoon.

06:02:59.979 --> 06:03:05.783
Martha Zaragoza-Diaz representing the California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

06:03:06.363 --> 06:03:15.369
And my comments are specific to tables 12 and 13 found in the state plan, specific to the equity data to be collected under ESSA.

06:03:16.030 --> 06:03:28.559
These tables reflect the various definitions of teacher credential status that will be used for the purpose of collecting data that will provide information regarding the rates at which low-income and children of color

06:03:29.019 --> 06:03:34.401
are taught by non-credentialed, non-qualified teachers.

06:03:35.082 --> 06:03:40.304
Definitions include ineffective teachers, out-of-field teachers, and experienced teachers.

06:03:41.104 --> 06:03:49.187
We are unclear as to what is meant by out-of-field teachers and whether that includes a teacher without an English learner authorization.

06:03:49.207 --> 06:03:54.570
In light of the fact that the law requires teachers to obtain an EL authorization,

06:03:55.531 --> 06:04:04.465
to instruct English learners, we recommend that the EL authorization be included in this out-of-field definition.

06:04:04.866 --> 06:04:05.167
Thank you.

06:04:09.602 --> 06:04:12.603
Good afternoon, Shelley Spiegel-Coleman with Californians Together.

06:04:12.663 --> 06:04:16.625
We want to address the designation of the lowest 5% Title I schools.

06:04:17.486 --> 06:04:28.011
And what we want to say is that this really brings to us another demonstration of the unintended consequence of including four years of the RFEP students.

06:04:28.571 --> 06:04:33.034
in the EL definition for academic indicators.

06:04:33.434 --> 06:04:34.514
We've looked at the data.

06:04:34.594 --> 06:04:42.779
Many, many of our low-achieving schools do not designate English learners as the subgroup that needs to be addressed because they turn out to be yellow.

06:04:43.299 --> 06:04:54.165
And when we then looked at the disaggregation of the English learner only versus the RFEP, many, many of the schools that are yellow for EL indicators are red.

06:04:54.665 --> 06:04:56.446
when you look at English learner only.

06:04:56.846 --> 06:05:03.090
So we really have a problem with using that definition for the designation of the lowest 5% schools.

06:05:03.170 --> 06:05:10.114
We hope that you will use the English learner only for when you're looking at designating the lowest 5% schools.

06:05:10.775 --> 06:05:17.018
Otherwise, many schools will not take it seriously and will not be designated for the work they need to do with English learners.

06:05:17.438 --> 06:05:18.259
Thank you very much.

06:05:23.168 --> 06:05:27.330
Hi again, Carla Herrera, IQC, Emerita, and Californians Together.

06:05:28.070 --> 06:05:36.355
Based on what we heard from Board Member Ortiz-Licon, we thank you for including the EL Roadmap in the appropriate places in the ESSA State Plan.

06:05:36.795 --> 06:05:42.478
We agree this is necessary in light of the fact that the EL Roadmap is now state policy for EL students.

06:05:43.138 --> 06:05:50.943
A good start would be including the Yale Roadmap in Table 14, California Strategies for Meeting Student Needs and Providing Effective Transitions.

06:05:51.363 --> 06:06:01.949
This table lists the strategies California will provide to Title I LEAs in order to address diverse student needs, support successful student transitions, and prevent dropouts.

06:06:02.349 --> 06:06:03.750
The Yale Roadmap includes

06:06:04.310 --> 06:06:07.537
strategies specific to the academic success of ELs.

06:06:07.978 --> 06:06:12.247
I'd like to quote the CDE news release number 17-52 paragraph 8 from July 13th.

06:06:15.569 --> 06:06:16.069
of this year.

06:06:16.510 --> 06:06:34.301
The English Learner Roadmap will also help California schools comply with the new Federal Every Student Succeeds Act, ESSA, and the state's local control funding, LCFF, both of which require specific assistance so English learners can meet the same academic standards as other students.

06:06:34.562 --> 06:06:34.882
Thank you.

06:06:35.979 --> 06:06:38.322
Would the following people please line up to speak?

06:06:38.822 --> 06:06:50.735
Melanie Thomas, Ken Burt, Michael Flores-Gastineau, Shelley Whitley, Lorraine Richards, Angela DeRamos, Martha Alvarez, Colin Miller, Renata Sanchez,

06:06:52.754 --> 06:07:09.597
Brian Rivas, Jan Correa, Kim Lewis, Rebecca Wu, Jacqueline Nader, Allison Osorio, Catherine Phillips, Swapnil Kalyankar, Samantha Tran, Terry Burns, and Darcelle Sanders.

06:07:09.817 --> 06:07:10.138
Thank you.

06:07:11.482 --> 06:07:16.745
Good afternoon, Sarek Kaminski, Policy Director at CCESA representing the 58 County Superintendents.

06:07:17.365 --> 06:07:28.050
We commend staff for their outreach and gathering feedback from the field and support staff's revision in the definition of ineffective teacher to meet a teacher that is misassigned rather than including teachers with interim credentials under this definition.

06:07:28.830 --> 06:07:32.032
Thank you, Member Rucker, for asking about the appropriate terminology.

06:07:32.652 --> 06:07:36.034
The CTC has authorized and validated a number of alternative paths

06:07:37.035 --> 06:07:41.279
to obtaining a clear credential and the district intern credential is one such track.

06:07:41.819 --> 06:07:50.408
To be granted this type of credential, both the teacher and the LEA must fulfill a number of requirements that adhere to CTC program standards and regulations.

06:07:51.069 --> 06:07:56.574
To qualify for the intern program, all participants must complete a required minimum of 120 intern

06:07:58.336 --> 06:08:10.878
120-hour intern pre-service preparation or six semester units of coursework and child development and methods of teaching, possess a bachelor's degree, satisfy the basic skills requirement, meet the subject matter competence requirement, meet the U.S.

06:08:10.918 --> 06:08:13.819
Constitution requirement, and obtain character and identification clearance.

06:08:14.579 --> 06:08:20.100
Labeling teachers that hold a district intern credentials ineffective at the state or federal level is inaccurate.

06:08:20.340 --> 06:08:22.941
We appreciate staff's responsiveness to stakeholder feedback.

06:08:23.061 --> 06:08:23.321
Thank you.

06:08:28.097 --> 06:08:32.081
Good afternoon, Doug McRae, Retired Educational Measurement Specialist for Monterey.

06:08:32.101 --> 06:08:40.951
A four-page set of comments on assessment and accountability were put in the special department electronic folder on this topic.

06:08:41.451 --> 06:08:46.437
A condensed version went into the State Board various items header.

06:08:47.097 --> 06:09:00.545
The highlight for accountability for me was that we won't know until at least January how well the California's plan will handle the ESSA requirement to identify the lowest 5% performing schools, Title I schools.

06:09:01.266 --> 06:09:06.649
Jury is still out on this high-profile aspect of the accountability plan.

06:09:07.470 --> 06:09:15.935
And frankly, I think likely there will be many anomalies and nitty-gritty technical problems when we get to that in January.

06:09:17.302 --> 06:09:17.587
Thank you.

06:09:23.035 --> 06:09:25.677
Good afternoon, Roberto Viramontes with the Learning Policy Institute.

06:09:26.097 --> 06:09:28.359
Thank you so much for all your work on the ESSA State Plan.

06:09:28.919 --> 06:09:33.843
I'd like to offer some comments with respect to ensuring all students have equitable access to excellent teachers.

06:09:34.563 --> 06:09:48.553
We appreciate the board's commitment to report at the state, district, and school levels data on the percentage of teachers who hold preliminary and clear credentials, who hold intern credentials, who are misassigned, and those who hold emergency type permits and waivers.

06:09:49.314 --> 06:09:51.396
We hope that this data will be reported on the dashboard.

06:09:52.236 --> 06:10:00.700
as they are consistent with priority one of LCFF, so that stakeholders have access to key equity data, which is even more important during this time of significant teacher shortages.

06:10:01.601 --> 06:10:09.965
Research shows that the share of teachers who have not met subject matter in teaching qualifications is strongly associated with teaching ineffectiveness as measured by student achievement gains.

06:10:10.385 --> 06:10:11.886
With defining ineffective teacher,

06:10:12.626 --> 06:10:20.893
We are comfortable with the revised definition, though we know that this revision creates a misalignment between the state accountability system, priority one, and the federal one.

06:10:21.614 --> 06:10:31.582
As we commented in July, we recommend that California collect and report additional data, including teacher survey data, which can measure school leadership quality, teacher professional learning, and data on teacher turnover and absences.

06:10:32.023 --> 06:10:37.728
We look forward to working with CDE and state board staff to explore how they can be incorporated into California's accountability system.

06:10:37.808 --> 06:10:38.108
Thank you.

06:10:44.693 --> 06:10:51.640
Hello and thank you both for allowing me to speak today and for updating the definition of an ineffective teacher in the September 1st draft of the ESSA plan.

06:10:52.121 --> 06:10:54.983
My name is Melanie Thomas and I'm in my eighth year of public education.

06:10:55.584 --> 06:11:00.089
I am a 2012 Teach for America Sacramento alumni where I taught with my intern teaching credential.

06:11:00.509 --> 06:11:07.076
Currently, I'm the special education coordinator for Kairos Public Schools in Vacaville, where I both directly supervise and I hire intern teachers.

06:11:07.577 --> 06:11:19.630
As an education specialist intern teacher, I worked relentlessly to ensure that in my first year of teaching, at least 90% of student IEP goals were met and 100% of IEP meetings, assessments, and evaluations were held within the legal timeframe.

06:11:20.291 --> 06:11:27.558
I now have the privilege of overseeing two intern teachers who are some of the most dedicated, passionate, and hardworking teachers I've had the honor to work with.

06:11:28.018 --> 06:11:33.623
Due to their hard work, our school site is aspiring to become a model of special education inclusion in our local area.

06:11:34.063 --> 06:11:38.367
We support multiple pathways into teaching to serve all students and to improve all schools.

06:11:38.828 --> 06:11:41.310
I urge you to adopt the definition with the change language.

06:11:47.577 --> 06:11:52.820
Good afternoon, Marta Alvarez on behalf of AXA, the Association of California School Administrators.

06:11:52.980 --> 06:12:03.187
AXA commends the state board in their continued work in ensuring that California's law, LCFF, and other underlying statutes are what's informing the federal work on ESSA.

06:12:03.787 --> 06:12:10.792
So we fully support the state plan in the direction that it's going, and it will be approved today to go to the federal government.

06:12:11.612 --> 06:12:17.136
We also just wanted to echo comments made by the other speakers regarding the ineffective teacher definition.

06:12:17.516 --> 06:12:21.338
We hope that conversation will continue in how do we report that data in the future.

06:12:21.939 --> 06:12:29.684
We look forward to continue to be part of the discussion about the lowest 5% of schools and how the work ties back to supporting school districts will be supporting those schools.

06:12:30.764 --> 06:12:37.586
And lastly, we really want to give our appreciation to the staff who has been working on this for the last 18 months.

06:12:38.366 --> 06:12:46.348
To quote Chief Deputy Price, he has mentioned in the past, if there was an LCFF Hall of Fame, Barbara Murchison's name would be on it.

06:12:47.068 --> 06:12:50.929
So thank you very much for the extensive work.

06:12:50.989 --> 06:12:55.290
You have done an excellent way of modeling what school districts are doing to engage their communities.

06:12:55.630 --> 06:12:57.031
Now you're just doing it at the state level.

06:12:57.231 --> 06:12:57.531
Thank you.

06:13:02.898 --> 06:13:03.598
Good afternoon.

06:13:03.958 --> 06:13:07.720
Jan Correa with the California Association for Bilingual Education.

06:13:08.100 --> 06:13:19.425
And I just want to begin by saying how much CAVE, as well as a member of the California Together Coalition, we support the statements made by both board member Ortiz-Lincon and Rucker on issues regarding the closing the achievement gap.

06:13:19.465 --> 06:13:20.625
So thank you for those comments.

06:13:21.325 --> 06:13:24.667
My statements today are regarding the translation issue within the plan.

06:13:25.607 --> 06:13:32.450
Table one states that teachers may translate the directions and test items in the language of instruction.

06:13:33.230 --> 06:13:52.345
And I'd like to state that in the spirit of and direction of both Prop 58 and the English Learner Roadmap, that the state of California should provide the translations of the specified assessments identified in Table 1 in order to establish consistency statewide and to ensure that no one goes beyond the language of assessments.

06:13:53.006 --> 06:14:02.233
Not providing the assessments or the translation of the assessments may create a disincentive for teachers to use this support and sends a message that it's not important and optional.

06:14:03.033 --> 06:14:12.601
CABE recommends that the state plan includes a statement, teachers shall use to provide the translations of test items and directions corresponding to the language of instruction.

06:14:12.922 --> 06:14:13.242
Thank you.

06:14:20.461 --> 06:14:44.959
Good afternoon, Kim Lewis representing the California Coalition for Youth today, and I want to applaud the board and staff for the work and revisions done to the section on the Education for Homeless Children and Youth Program, the McKinney-Vento Act, and incorporating a lot of suggestions that CCY had provided to the group, especially with the call out for unaccompanied homeless youth who do not have parents with them at that time, and so challenges of getting through enrollment and access can be

06:14:45.940 --> 06:14:47.181
much more difficult for them.

06:14:47.741 --> 06:15:08.122
And then I want to also say that, you know, I want to ensure that the Office of the Statewide Coordinator with all these duties and tasks that are included in this part of the plan has enough capacity to ensure that we are meeting those parts of the plan and be able to exercise that because California has been a real leader in championing, removing barriers to access to education for homeless children with a lot of recent passage of bills.

06:15:08.663 --> 06:15:09.766
and additional activities.

06:15:09.866 --> 06:15:15.623
So school tends to be that one place for youth where they have that continuity even if they are homeless.

06:15:15.804 --> 06:15:16.064
Thank you.

06:15:20.834 --> 06:15:23.796
Good afternoon, Colin Miller with the California Charter Schools Association.

06:15:24.956 --> 06:15:31.220
I wanted to just address two specific issues that we raised in our letter in July and again this month.

06:15:32.220 --> 06:15:37.643
With regard to the credentialing issue, we do appreciate the change to address intern teachers.

06:15:38.144 --> 06:15:42.106
We also do appreciate the addition of the note regarding charter school flexibility.

06:15:42.506 --> 06:15:55.971
However, I think I just heard Dr. Sun clarify that indeed that footnote means that charter school teachers that are hired under that flexibility will not be identified as ineffective.

06:15:56.031 --> 06:15:59.733
And I wanted to be clear that that's the intent because the language is not exactly clear.

06:16:00.753 --> 06:16:14.919
On the charter accountability piece, we did offer some language that we think is very simple and clean that would address the absence of any recognition of that section in the response to the prompt.

06:16:15.299 --> 06:16:22.763
There's a very specific prompt in the plan requirements regarding charter school accountability and flexibility.

06:16:23.743 --> 06:16:27.665
It was not addressed and we do think that it must be addressed or else you'll have a

06:16:28.887 --> 06:16:30.773
not only an incomplete but a non-compliant plan.

06:16:30.793 --> 06:16:32.578
So we want to make sure that that gets taken care of.

06:16:32.779 --> 06:16:33.019
Thank you.

06:16:43.234 --> 06:16:44.375
Good afternoon.

06:16:44.615 --> 06:16:47.317
Rigel Massaro, Senior Staff Attorney with Public Advocates.

06:16:47.337 --> 06:16:48.678
I'm a former intern teacher.

06:16:49.158 --> 06:16:53.381
I want to say that intern pathways are necessary and they're not going away in this time of teacher shortage.

06:16:53.841 --> 06:16:59.365
At the same time, any teacher not included in our ineffective definition is by definition effective.

06:16:59.505 --> 06:17:03.007
And California has rigorous standards for effectiveness in teachers.

06:17:03.548 --> 06:17:06.750
We base effectiveness on a rigorous performance assessment.

06:17:07.950 --> 06:17:16.994
And while interns are diverse and bring long-term educators into the classroom, they're not proven effective until they complete their program after one to two years of teaching.

06:17:17.395 --> 06:17:19.055
They can become teachers of record after 120 hours.

06:17:21.491 --> 06:17:24.292
Access to fully prepared teachers is a civil rights issue.

06:17:24.533 --> 06:17:30.035
California defines fully prepared as a teacher who's completed a credentialing program and passed the TPA.

06:17:30.756 --> 06:17:41.621
This principle is long recognized in California law, which requires transparency about student access to fully prepared teachers in our SARC and is aligned with LCFF priority number one.

06:17:42.562 --> 06:17:47.944
Under California law, districts cannot hire intern teachers unless fully credentialed teachers aren't available.

06:17:48.465 --> 06:17:48.765
Thank you.

06:17:58.379 --> 06:18:03.984
My name is Renata Sanchez, and I am an instructional coach in San Jose, speaking as an individual.

06:18:04.004 --> 06:18:16.654
I am also nationally board certified, a member of the California Instructional Leadership Corps, vice president of my local association, and I began my journey in education teaching on an intern credential.

06:18:17.853 --> 06:18:24.358
I want to thank the board for updating the definition of an ineffective teacher in the current draft of the ESSA plan.

06:18:25.459 --> 06:18:29.642
Living and working as a teacher in the Bay Area has been incredibly challenging.

06:18:30.342 --> 06:18:34.866
Attending a traditional program was never a financial option for me upon graduation.

06:18:35.686 --> 06:18:40.389
I am so thankful I was given the opportunity to participate in an intern credential program.

06:18:41.089 --> 06:18:49.913
As an intern teacher I worked in a title one school and I had 29 out of 30 of my fourth grade students reach proficient on the CST that year.

06:18:51.034 --> 06:19:01.740
Valuing multiple pathways into teaching led to my success and the success of my students and I encourage the board to continue to support intern teachers as effective teachers.

06:19:02.020 --> 06:19:02.340
Thank you.

06:19:09.318 --> 06:19:16.841
Hi, Angela de Ramos on behalf of CTA and I wanted to officially pass the label of newbie liaison and introduce Michael Castaneda.

06:19:18.285 --> 06:19:23.768
Good afternoon, Michael Flores Castaneda, representing California Teachers Association, and I'll also be speaking on behalf of my colleagues behind me.

06:19:24.328 --> 06:19:35.233
I first want to express CTA's appreciation for the many months of dedicated efforts by the State Board and CDE staff in drafting this plan, as well as for the opportunity to respond today.

06:19:35.933 --> 06:19:44.698
As the chair of CTA's Special Education Committee, I was fortunate enough to be on the work group that reviewed the plan, representing the interests of our most vulnerable students and their educators.

06:19:45.578 --> 06:19:59.793
Of the notable improvements in the current draft, the most significant is the renewed commitment to continuing to pursue a single coherent system that avoids having separate state and federal accountability structures, though many details must still be ironed out.

06:20:01.055 --> 06:20:04.338
All of our comments on the latest draft are in the letter that you received today.

06:20:05.339 --> 06:20:15.789
As you make your final edits, CTA respectfully recommends the board revise the proposed long-term goals and treat all green and blue cells as meeting or exceeding the goals.

06:20:16.569 --> 06:20:24.216
The board should not allow ESSA to force California to adopt goals that are inconsistent with our LCFF system, thereby creating confusion.

06:20:25.097 --> 06:20:33.425
And lastly, we strongly recommend that the board reject the last minute proposal to strike the word full before credential in the definition of ineffective teacher.

06:20:33.965 --> 06:20:40.832
It is rushed, ill-conceived and misaligned with our LCFF and the statutory language of priority one.

06:20:41.893 --> 06:20:49.400
We supported this section of the plan as it was written in the August draft, and we urge the board to continue with the direction it provided to staff in the July meeting.

06:20:49.500 --> 06:20:49.780
Thank you.

06:21:03.464 --> 06:21:08.209
President Kirst, I'm Brian Rivas speaking on behalf of the Education Trust West.

06:21:09.090 --> 06:21:11.072
We agree with Member Ortiz-Licón.

06:21:11.653 --> 06:21:21.343
We wish that you had approached this task with her suggested orientation that this was a way to pursue civil rights for low-income students and students of color.

06:21:22.143 --> 06:21:26.645
So although this is not, my comment shouldn't be interpreted as a criticism of the staff work.

06:21:26.705 --> 06:21:29.626
I think the staff did a great job, but we're disappointed.

06:21:29.746 --> 06:21:42.351
We think this is a missed opportunity to weave together all of the disparate parts like school ratings and goals and supports and interventions to move the needle for students who need the most help.

06:21:43.252 --> 06:21:50.595
With regard to the narrow dispute over the change in the definition for ineffective teacher, we agree with the recent change.

06:21:51.595 --> 06:22:02.637
but we're still, I think, disappointed overall and think the definition of an ineffective teacher should take into consideration the effect that a teacher has on student outcomes.

06:22:03.058 --> 06:22:07.078
We hope that you'll return to that work and consider improvements.

06:22:15.960 --> 06:22:19.041
Good afternoon, I'm Jacqueline Nader with Partners for Each and Every Child.

06:22:19.585 --> 06:22:26.291
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment today and for the multiple opportunities that the public has had to weigh in on the Essence State Plan.

06:22:26.872 --> 06:22:32.537
We know, however, that the work to create a strong accountability system for equity and excellence is not yet complete.

06:22:32.757 --> 06:22:43.627
And so with that in mind, we would ask the board and CDE to continue to work with the stakeholders in this room, as well as the voices that haven't typically been heard in these kinds of policy discussions going forward.

06:22:44.267 --> 06:22:50.249
And we have a few recommendations to ensure that specifically diverse families and communities are fully engaged and involved.

06:22:50.910 --> 06:22:59.973
First, we would recommend that you publish a list of the decisions that have yet to be made or finalized, a timeline of those decisions, and guidance on how the public can continue to engage going forward.

06:23:00.894 --> 06:23:11.843
Second, we recommend that you develop a comprehensive plan for deeper stakeholder engagement, particularly to reach historically unheard voices, reflecting back on the work that you've already done.

06:23:11.863 --> 06:23:18.808
And finally, we suggest that you commit additional resources to build capacity for really deep stakeholder engagement at all levels of the system.

06:23:19.229 --> 06:23:20.930
We look forward to working with you to support you.

06:23:20.950 --> 06:23:21.711
Thank you very much.

06:23:26.414 --> 06:23:28.556
Good afternoon, Samantha Tran with Children Now.

06:23:29.176 --> 06:23:41.327
Over the last four years, along with partners, we've shared analyses, put forward solutions, tried to change those solutions based on the board's direction, and have increasingly shared some serious concerns.

06:23:41.787 --> 06:23:50.575
We continue to be strong supporters of the principles in LCFF and celebrate many of the aspects of that transformation that's occurring across the state with you.

06:23:51.535 --> 06:23:57.817
We believe it's the right direction for California and because it's the right direction and we want it to be here for the long haul, the details matter.

06:23:58.757 --> 06:24:12.581
In particular, our criticism of the ESSA plan and the state plan overall has been grounded in the belief that we can only serve kids and improve their outcomes if we're really willing to fundamentally see them and see our most vulnerable children in particular.

06:24:13.141 --> 06:24:18.365
there are far too many provisions in the ESSA plan and the state's approach that obscures those realities.

06:24:19.205 --> 06:24:23.929
Given how these processes work, we know it's far too late to change the plan that's about to be submitted.

06:24:24.549 --> 06:24:30.754
So given that, we would just ask that as the federal government comes back and raises the issue of transparency that we address those quickly.

06:24:30.994 --> 06:24:31.254
Thank you.

06:24:38.354 --> 06:24:41.236
Hello, I'm Catherine Phillips from Teach for America Los Angeles.

06:24:41.837 --> 06:24:47.041
I'd like to thank the board for recognizing that effective teachers come from all backgrounds and all pipelines.

06:24:47.822 --> 06:24:53.827
Non-traditional intern credential pathways are the most diverse pipeline in the state, enrolling nearly 50% people of color.

06:24:53.987 --> 06:24:57.390
And at TFA LA, we're looking at closer to 75% this year.

06:24:58.951 --> 06:25:00.992
We also produce high quality teachers.

06:25:01.493 --> 06:25:07.737
A study of intern credential teachers in LAUSD by Harvard University found that interns were just as effective as other new teachers.

06:25:08.257 --> 06:25:15.962
And each of the last three years, TFA LA interns have been recognized as rookies of the year, which means we're in the top tier of all the teachers at LAUSD.

06:25:16.663 --> 06:25:25.549
We welcome the opportunity to continue to work alongside the more than 70 intern credential pathways in the state to grow, improve, and diversify the workforce in California.

06:25:25.869 --> 06:25:26.089
Thank you.

06:25:33.314 --> 06:25:40.856
Darcelle Sanders representing Teach for America California, which trains and supports 600 teachers and thousands of alumni educators across our state each year.

06:25:41.276 --> 06:25:45.457
We would like to thank the board for eliminating the reference to intern credential teachers as ineffective.

06:25:45.757 --> 06:25:52.139
Intern programs are the most diverse pipeline for teachers in California and produce high quality educators who see the potential in all of our kids.

06:25:52.739 --> 06:25:57.903
I know this from our data, but I also know this from my experience teaching middle school in Oakland Unified School District.

06:25:58.323 --> 06:25:59.704
I started as an intern teacher.

06:25:59.844 --> 06:26:04.267
My mentor teacher was a California Teacher of the Year who was also a TFA intern teacher.

06:26:04.808 --> 06:26:07.410
We were both women of color, both grew up low income.

06:26:07.570 --> 06:26:10.112
We were mirrors to our students and windows to opportunity.

06:26:10.492 --> 06:26:14.535
One student message stands out to me when I reflect on the importance of diversity in the profession.

06:26:15.275 --> 06:26:20.359
It read in part, you gave me a Latino male that did not want to go to college the courage to try and achieve.

06:26:20.579 --> 06:26:22.781
I finally got a 4.0 and I owe it all to you.

06:26:23.402 --> 06:26:28.185
He owes it all to himself, but nonetheless, his words underscore the importance of a diverse workforce.

06:26:28.646 --> 06:26:30.927
My story is not an exception, but the rule.

06:26:31.248 --> 06:26:32.689
Intern pipelines are diverse.

06:26:32.909 --> 06:26:34.430
Intern teachers are effective.

06:26:34.950 --> 06:26:38.573
And with your support today, we will continue to help change the trajectory of our students.

06:26:38.633 --> 06:26:44.438
We'd also like to submit written testimony from teachers and principals who are unable to leave their school sites and their classrooms today.

06:26:44.778 --> 06:26:45.138
Thank you.

06:26:48.441 --> 06:26:51.944
Good afternoon, Terry Burns on behalf of the California School Boards Association.

06:26:51.964 --> 06:27:02.232
I want to associate ourselves with AXS's comments and appreciation of all the work of staff, particularly in their outreach efforts to all the stakeholders above and beyond.

06:27:02.272 --> 06:27:03.133
Very much appreciated.

06:27:04.642 --> 06:27:18.270
We support the recommended change in the teacher definition and pursuant to our letter, we look forward to building that out even further on the lines that Ed Trust West was talking about, really looking at individual teacher effectiveness.

06:27:18.990 --> 06:27:26.234
Finally, we look forward to a build out of the definition of the bottom 5% and the identification of the bottom 5% of schools.

06:27:26.715 --> 06:27:30.197
We see that as an opportunity to take into account gap closure.

06:27:30.737 --> 06:27:32.462
with different student populations.

06:27:33.284 --> 06:27:38.277
CSBA believes that gap closure should be a key focus of this effort.

06:27:38.538 --> 06:27:38.818
Thank you.

06:27:43.854 --> 06:27:46.115
Good afternoon, President Kurst, members of the board.

06:27:46.195 --> 06:27:53.038
Ron Rapp speaking on behalf of the 120,000 educators that we represent at the California Federation of Teachers.

06:27:53.839 --> 06:27:59.361
First, I want to thank the board for their guidance and development of what we think is a high quality ESSA plan.

06:27:59.401 --> 06:28:00.902
Thank you so much for that guidance.

06:28:01.402 --> 06:28:08.986
We also agree with my colleague from AXA in terms of Barbara Murchison should receive at least a trophy, if not a medal.

06:28:09.866 --> 06:28:11.167
and be in the Hall of Fame.

06:28:11.948 --> 06:28:22.596
Thank you for developing a plan that is aligned with the California way and doesn't take us away from our vision for a high quality education system for all children.

06:28:22.676 --> 06:28:23.556
Thank you for that.

06:28:24.257 --> 06:28:32.343
And also we'd like to mention that we'd like to thank you for providing an opportunity for extensive input.

06:28:33.043 --> 06:28:38.247
Barbara and her staff presented at several of our meetings and allowed our folks to

06:28:38.708 --> 06:28:41.616
provide input into the plan and we're very appreciative of that.

06:28:41.716 --> 06:28:42.077
Thank you.

06:28:48.274 --> 06:28:49.035
Good afternoon.

06:28:49.075 --> 06:28:51.497
I'm Ashley Lotsenheiser with Parent Revolution.

06:28:51.838 --> 06:28:55.001
Thank you for the opportunity to continue to provide comment.

06:28:55.461 --> 06:29:01.867
Likely, I'm echoing comments of other partners today who work directly with students and families in historically underserved communities.

06:29:02.768 --> 06:29:10.616
Broadly, California's education leadership has a responsibility to address and close the racial and economic opportunity gaps that are so widespread.

06:29:11.076 --> 06:29:12.517
in our public education system.

06:29:12.958 --> 06:29:24.225
We still believe that the board had a responsibility to develop an ESSA plan that better identifies the lowest performing schools in the state and put forward real details with accompanying accountability measures on how to improve them.

06:29:24.566 --> 06:29:28.749
All of this along a timeline that offers real hope of relief for the students stuck in these schools.

06:29:29.589 --> 06:29:44.281
While we understand that multiple platforms and policy frameworks are at various stages of implementation, we remain concerned that the current ESSA plan does not properly identify the lowest performing schools in California, nor does it act with any urgency to put in place a plan to improve student outcomes.

06:29:45.002 --> 06:29:51.947
Maximum flexibility without this accountability does a disservice to the students and persistently low performing schools who do not have years to wait.

06:29:52.148 --> 06:29:52.408
Thank you.

06:29:59.099 --> 06:30:04.564
Good afternoon, Sarah Lillis with EdVoice and Board Member Ortiz-Lee Cohn, we share your disappointment.

06:30:04.584 --> 06:30:07.466
I think as you all know, we've had many, many letters and comments.

06:30:08.067 --> 06:30:14.713
We'd hoped for more in terms of meeting the requirements of the federal civil rights law, as well as the promise of LCFF.

06:30:16.334 --> 06:30:20.998
But we do appreciate staff's responsiveness to our concerns about the definition of ineffective teachers.

06:30:21.679 --> 06:30:28.785
We would, like our colleagues at CSBA and at Trust West and X, I'd like to continue to move forward about looking at other measures of effectiveness.

06:30:29.505 --> 06:30:38.833
But we did want to confirm that in Title V of the California Code of State Regulations there is, they do establish the definition of a teaching credential in Section 80033.

06:30:38.873 --> 06:30:39.354
So it is a

06:30:41.515 --> 06:31:06.386
credential and as you heard from our colleagues from CESA there are extensive regulations tied to that and we would be concerned if we were to if we were to say that that is an ineffective credential that you're opening up that the legislation the CTC has has said that those teachers can be teaching students and you open up the state and the district to lots of litigation so we hope to continue to work on this to make it a meaningful measure of effectiveness but we appreciate this the amendment that the staff made.

06:31:06.506 --> 06:31:06.786
Thank you.

06:31:14.033 --> 06:31:15.434
Includes the public comment.

06:31:15.514 --> 06:31:30.040
So I'd like to first talk to, turn to Board Member Strauss to comment on, we still have the Part 4A open and we have the question that, that Board Member Rucker asked.

06:31:30.080 --> 06:31:34.662
So do you want to, are we ready to address the question that she asked or?

06:31:34.882 --> 06:31:35.522
Yeah, absolutely.

06:31:35.602 --> 06:31:37.623
Carrick, if you would come up and talk a little.

06:31:37.703 --> 06:31:39.484
And we can turn to Board Member Strauss.

06:31:42.694 --> 06:31:42.994
Thank you.

06:31:43.014 --> 06:31:43.535
Good afternoon.

06:31:43.575 --> 06:31:47.939
Carrick Ashley, Deputy Superintendent, Performance Planning and Technology Branch.

06:31:49.701 --> 06:32:04.876
So it's not surprising that there's a little confusion because the federal government was very clear fairly early on in ESSA for the 2016-17 transition plan and what needed to be in it, and it was written

06:32:07.498 --> 06:32:16.063
That guidance was directed mostly to states that didn't have a previous waiver, which of course California would be under.

06:32:16.144 --> 06:32:22.548
So, when you approve that transition plan, it was pretty specific to Title I. There's been less

06:32:23.588 --> 06:32:24.849
information from the U.S.

06:32:24.889 --> 06:32:26.791
Department of Education about other titles.

06:32:27.271 --> 06:32:42.102
But in terms of program improvement, it was pretty specific in our guidance to our school districts and schools was also pretty specific that it was a transition year, that that transition now carries over

06:32:43.162 --> 06:32:52.811
We are not identifying any new program improvement schools for those schools that we're not even using the phrase program improvement schools anymore.

06:32:53.592 --> 06:32:57.996
For those that were previously identified as program improvement schools,

06:33:00.738 --> 06:33:17.430
The transition plan relieved them from the obligation of reserving 10% of their Title I funds and offering the school choice and requiring the offering of SES, the Supplemental Education Services.

06:33:18.510 --> 06:33:28.497
And in lieu of that, they could continue those if they wanted, but in lieu of that, they were to provide some activities for schools, for students in those schools

06:33:29.438 --> 06:33:32.480
that are designed to help improve student outcomes.

06:33:32.960 --> 06:33:36.102
And so that continues during the 17-18 year.

06:33:36.522 --> 06:33:42.166
As you know, some states have their plan approved and they have the option of moving ahead and doing something in 17-18.

06:33:43.667 --> 06:33:51.253
For California, we could choose to move ahead and do something differently once we have an approved state plan.

06:33:51.913 --> 06:33:56.316
But at this point in time, we're continuing with the transition from 16-17.

06:33:59.909 --> 06:34:01.329
Board member Strauss, are you ready?

06:34:02.550 --> 06:34:21.494
So I want to talk about the investment in capacity for teachers and leaders, because all of our work has been talking about narrowing the achievement gap, subgroup growth and improvement, which we know the first and biggest defining character is what happens in that classroom every single day.

06:34:22.114 --> 06:34:26.375
And every and one and the second, by the way, is the role of the instructional leader.

06:34:26.455 --> 06:34:27.355
That's the second one.

06:34:27.475 --> 06:34:39.683
So what we've realized when we've been out talking to districts is continuing to invest in the capacity both of new teachers but also teachers at different stages of their career and leaders.

06:34:40.384 --> 06:34:45.007
And because if we pass state policy and don't work on implementation and even

06:34:45.527 --> 06:34:52.573
in Michael Fullen's research, he was talking about the implementation flaws and how we needed to really address that.

06:34:52.653 --> 06:35:08.027
And so as one of the liaisons who works on the liaison work to the instructional practice, I just want to talk about why I think we should transfer to support the capacity and support of teacher practice and leader practice.

06:35:08.808 --> 06:35:11.991
The communities of practice in both science and in math

06:35:13.618 --> 06:35:18.342
bring together about a hundred educators in science and a hundred in math from regionally around our state.

06:35:18.582 --> 06:35:19.323
We have a huge state.

06:35:19.343 --> 06:35:23.866
We've heard today about districts as small as eight or 50 or a hundred.

06:35:23.886 --> 06:35:28.350
And I think more than half of our districts in the state are 2,500 or less.

06:35:28.410 --> 06:35:29.851
And then giant, giant districts.

06:35:30.291 --> 06:35:36.236
And then the challenges of getting teachers and leaders into the field and staying persistently in the field.

06:35:36.716 --> 06:35:49.548
And so the regional communities of practice are actually bringing our leaders together to build capacity with the expectation that they will go back and expand practice in their regions all over this giant state.

06:35:49.989 --> 06:35:54.313
And so, but what districts are saying, and I know we hear this, is that

06:35:54.933 --> 06:35:56.334
money is starting to get tight again.

06:35:56.354 --> 06:35:58.736
The one-time money for Common Core is not there.

06:35:59.236 --> 06:36:07.783
That the pension costs are increasing and so districts are finding less flexibility to invest in professional practice than they used to.

06:36:07.863 --> 06:36:12.726
So, I think that what we know is it's not the one-shot deals.

06:36:12.787 --> 06:36:14.007
It's not the two-hour meeting.

06:36:14.067 --> 06:36:17.310
It's not the great faculty meeting that some of us tried to run.

06:36:17.990 --> 06:36:20.312
But it is ongoing investment in

06:36:21.753 --> 06:36:31.597
And really, labor intensive coaching and capacity building, late lesson study, building over time is what we really know makes a difference.

06:36:31.657 --> 06:36:39.101
So, I just wanted to say just as we're developing a health framework now, we have a math framework

06:36:40.001 --> 06:36:45.422
that was the first that we did in this generation, then the literacy framework, then the history and science framework.

06:36:45.822 --> 06:36:50.583
And we're discovering that we have teachers who don't know what these frameworks are.

06:36:50.603 --> 06:36:52.603
They just bought a book and they're teaching the book.

06:36:53.103 --> 06:37:04.125
And so what we realize is that some of the reasons that I believe and that I see out in districts where our math scores are not what we hope is because the book wasn't necessarily aligned to the new standards.

06:37:04.205 --> 06:37:07.686
It was stamped Common Core, but maybe not as aligned as it could be.

06:37:08.306 --> 06:37:19.354
And so teachers often in secondary teach the book and didn't need more time to really understand our frameworks and what resources they have to support the frameworks and what they need to do to develop.

06:37:19.474 --> 06:37:20.415
All that takes time.

06:37:20.975 --> 06:37:23.737
And so I know we're going to talk about some of our needs.

06:37:23.977 --> 06:37:28.421
I believe the continuing focus on mathematics is critical in our state.

06:37:28.481 --> 06:37:31.503
It's a gateway and a gatekeeper for kids going forward.

06:37:32.063 --> 06:37:36.987
I believe the next generation science standards people are embracing, but that's hugely different.

06:37:37.188 --> 06:37:41.551
Major shifts we're going to need, I would say 10 years at least of investment.

06:37:42.012 --> 06:37:47.656
And overall, the support for English learners in our state, in all of our instructional strategies.

06:37:48.697 --> 06:37:58.846
In every one of our frameworks, we're layering that in, and yet we go to districts where teachers haven't seen that, that don't realize that there's integrated and designated ELD as part of our expectation.

06:37:59.406 --> 06:38:10.595
So all that means is that I believe that we should support moving money to support professional capacity building for teachers and leaders to sustain the work.

06:38:13.937 --> 06:38:16.659
So let me just also support separate from that piece.

06:38:17.320 --> 06:38:21.083
I support the change in the language on the intern credential.

06:38:21.103 --> 06:38:24.666
I think we heard a huge amount of testimony and letters to support that.

06:38:24.706 --> 06:38:28.308
I think that's really important and I support

06:38:29.557 --> 06:38:33.681
the inclusion of the English Learner Roadmap that we've been talking about.

06:38:33.761 --> 06:38:36.923
And it was a wonderful celebration at our July meeting.

06:38:36.963 --> 06:38:43.208
But I think we have so much work to do to help everybody understand a first core instruction is for all kids.

06:38:43.248 --> 06:38:44.810
That's all teachers for all kids.

06:38:45.110 --> 06:38:54.538
That's English learners, that's special needs that we need to help our teachers have those strategies before they're set out to designated support that's separate from the core classroom.

06:38:54.598 --> 06:38:57.180
And so we're going to need a lot of support on those resources.

06:38:58.121 --> 06:39:08.070
And then our curriculum frameworks that we work so hard to develop and vet and get public input and then are not a regular practice of some of our classrooms in our schools.

06:39:08.150 --> 06:39:21.082
So again, I support the supporting of investing in teacher and leader capacity for professional development and moving some of those funds to support that, the intern credential, the frameworks and English learner roadmap.

06:39:21.403 --> 06:39:21.683
Thank you.

06:39:22.915 --> 06:39:30.962
So you're supporting moving the Part IV-A to Title II?

06:39:33.384 --> 06:39:38.508
Okay, moving Part IV-A money to state administrative money to...

06:39:41.218 --> 06:39:41.438
Okay.

06:39:41.638 --> 06:39:56.846
So I guess my passionate plea was that we need to invest in our capacity building and that the way to do that is to put that money in Title II, Part A. The Chief Deputy wants to speak.

06:39:56.886 --> 06:39:58.066
He has a different point of view.

06:39:59.967 --> 06:40:01.088
Thank you, President Gerson.

06:40:01.248 --> 06:40:06.991
And I first wanted to start out by thanking all the wonderful stakeholders that came out to present to us today.

06:40:07.171 --> 06:40:09.232
Really appreciate all the feedback and comments

06:40:09.901 --> 06:40:21.652
Not only today, but over this last 18 months, your outpouring of ideas, suggestions, feedback, comments has just been wonderful and super appreciated by the superintendent.

06:40:23.181 --> 06:40:38.648
I also want to have first claim, if I can, on the person who does the induction speech when Barbara is inducted, the speech of introduction when Barbara is introduced to the LCFF Hall of Fame.

06:40:39.948 --> 06:40:43.850
I think when people around the state hear this thing called the ESSA State Office,

06:40:44.589 --> 06:40:54.317
they visualize like tens of people who are upstairs on the sixth floor doing all this incredible work because of all the output and incredible volume of work.

06:40:54.677 --> 06:41:04.345
But in reality, just want everybody to know, it's two people, Barbara Murchison and Joy Kessel, and they've just done extraordinary work over these last 18 months.

06:41:04.365 --> 06:41:08.948
So on behalf of basically all of California, Barbara and Joy, thank you so much.

06:41:10.349 --> 06:41:11.931
Relating, I wanted to primarily address

06:41:13.095 --> 06:41:21.579
the issue of the Title IV Part A Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants, which is still an area where the board needs to make a decision.

06:41:22.239 --> 06:41:33.445
And if you look at page, I believe it's page 29 of Attachment 2, there are two options that are laid out for the board in looking at those funds.

06:41:34.725 --> 06:41:39.888
So option one would be to promote student access to a well-rounded education.

06:41:40.467 --> 06:41:53.337
And it reads that California would use a portion of its Title IV Part A, Subpart I state-level activity ones to build the capacity of California educators to successfully implement state academic content standards.

06:41:53.357 --> 06:41:54.738
So let me just make a parenthetical.

06:41:55.196 --> 06:42:04.119
comment here, Board Member Strassel, I think that we can accommodate your intent, which I think is awesome and we would all support under option one.

06:42:05.479 --> 06:42:15.803
It also says that, in addition, California will use a portion of its Title IV Part A, Subpart I state-level activity funds to support LEAs to improve school conditions for student learning.

06:42:16.143 --> 06:42:19.324
And it directs us to that portion of the plan.

06:42:20.084 --> 06:42:22.145
So the, you know, the

06:42:23.305 --> 06:42:34.074
When we talk about small amounts of resources here, we're really getting into very small amounts of resources, but there's still critical leverage points that we can use as a state to accomplish our objectives.

06:42:34.134 --> 06:42:36.296
And one thing we've heard about earlier is that

06:42:37.068 --> 06:42:44.870
One of the things that we've done here at the Department of Education under the superintendent's leadership is realigned to maximize our internal resources.

06:42:44.950 --> 06:43:06.194
And one of the most of many, many exciting activities that have come out of that have been the work that CDE and CSESA and the State Board of Education have worked to promote and promulgate these standards collaboration committees, which I know Board Member Strauss participates in, which have just done an extraordinary job

06:43:06.678 --> 06:43:10.300
of promulgating and building capacity around state standards.

06:43:10.340 --> 06:43:22.305
And we're going to hear more a little bit later on today about another area where we hope that some new state funding can help to further that work even further in the area of history and social sciences.

06:43:22.966 --> 06:43:29.689
So when I discussed this with Superintendent Torokson, he felt that option one, which is again described on page six of attachment one,

06:43:30.433 --> 06:43:35.616
represents the preferential path for the ESSA State Plan for three primary reasons.

06:43:35.756 --> 06:43:45.922
Number one, it really, it kind of optimizes the spirit and furthers the spirit of LCF in terms of our commitment to multiple measures.

06:43:46.522 --> 06:43:50.724
We've talked about this a lot over the past few months, over the past few years, and today.

06:43:52.806 --> 06:44:03.154
In light of, and I thought board member Burr's comments earlier were the most cogent in terms of thinking about, we need to be thinking about all of the indicators that we have and all the priorities that we have.

06:44:03.755 --> 06:44:12.202
And up until now, we've been moving this system forward without investing in a couple of those areas as much as we probably should have.

06:44:12.562 --> 06:44:14.644
And that would include the area of school conditions.

06:44:15.239 --> 06:44:19.080
and climate priority six, which we also spoke to earlier.

06:44:19.721 --> 06:44:30.304
I believe that option one also better realizes the spirit of LCFF's commitment to the whole child as we think about the different areas that we want to address.

06:44:30.384 --> 06:44:41.088
And I think the universal recognition that we heard earlier that school climate, which Title IV-A specifically addresses, is absolutely fundamental.

06:44:41.548 --> 06:44:45.871
including not only student climate and school climate, but teacher climate.

06:44:46.571 --> 06:44:53.395
And then lastly, I think the third major argument in favor of keeping the Title IV-A state-level activity funds

06:44:54.042 --> 06:45:01.251
in option one in the area that they're designed for under ESSA would be that it provides us with greater flexibility.

06:45:02.332 --> 06:45:03.894
We've been looking for flexibility.

06:45:04.555 --> 06:45:13.306
We've been looking for ways that we can, and to borrow a metaphor from my old surfer days, which are long gone, is that

06:45:14.113 --> 06:45:17.835
that LCFF provides the wave and we've got this ESSA surfboard.

06:45:18.335 --> 06:45:26.420
We don't want ESSA to dictate where we can be putting our funds and how we're furthering our LCFF objectives.

06:45:27.296 --> 06:45:43.306
With option one, we've got a ton of flexibility because the ESSA language specifically allows us to utilize those state-level activity funds to build capacity for our California educators and to further the promulgation of standards.

06:45:43.326 --> 06:45:56.055
But it also would allow us the flexibility, if the board desired, to utilize a portion of those funds for things like the kinds of very critical school conditions and climate and whole child type activities that we've been talking about today.

06:45:58.196 --> 06:46:01.539
The superintendent would urge that we take an option one approach.

06:46:01.859 --> 06:46:14.089
I think that allows us to further the objectives that you've laid out, Board Member Strauss, while still allowing us as a state the opportunity to engage in some school conditions and climate work funded under ESSA in the future.

06:46:16.291 --> 06:46:20.915
Okay, I think maybe we ought to get a motion on the floor of Board Member Rucker.

06:46:23.447 --> 06:46:30.354
Well, I'm of two minds concerning this transfer of funds on this Title IV money.

06:46:30.894 --> 06:46:43.466
In watching the work the federal government had done and the conversation the Secretary had with Congress when she submitted her budget, she basically had zeroed out a lot of that money.

06:46:44.427 --> 06:46:57.674
And in doing that, it sent a chilling message across the country about what the administration's priorities are concerning the work that Title IV is intended to do in schools.

06:46:58.214 --> 06:47:12.381
So, I want to remind the board what board member Lee Cone, Ortiz Lee Cone said about the opportunity to make sure that we are using this plan to address civil rights issues.

06:47:12.981 --> 06:47:18.284
and to address and support and affirm the intent behind this civil rights legislation.

06:47:18.844 --> 06:47:27.128
The community schools program that's listed in ESSA is intended to address that very important element.

06:47:27.688 --> 06:47:35.312
And while we have a lot of work that does need to be done to fund the activities enumerated in Title II,

06:47:36.383 --> 06:47:39.567
We can't abandon that particular priority either.

06:47:40.127 --> 06:47:55.965
And so I think it is important to create, if the districts that came and testified today in a different item focused on the capacity development, the capacity building that they're gonna do.

06:47:56.886 --> 06:48:01.469
That's what Title IV is about, and it happens in a number of different ways.

06:48:01.869 --> 06:48:18.218
And the driver or the center of action or the locus of control where that work actually happens isn't just centered on the conversations the superintendents are doing among themselves, but in the communities where these schools

06:48:18.698 --> 06:48:20.179
are actually working.

06:48:20.820 --> 06:48:28.045
A corollary to some of the funding that's related to Title IV is funding for schools for promised neighborhoods.

06:48:28.466 --> 06:48:36.552
And so that money can be used as a match for those particular competitive grants to support those programs and to implement them.

06:48:37.748 --> 06:48:53.007
We're familiar with that particular program in this state because we had several districts when they received their SIG grants, they blended their SIG grants with their Promise Neighborhood Grant and they created and implemented a broader program improvement plan.

06:48:53.507 --> 06:48:59.110
that incorporated work across the community in the neighborhoods where those SIG schools were.

06:48:59.590 --> 06:49:05.853
So I think we have to understand not just what it is we're trying to fund and what it is we're trying to do.

06:49:05.933 --> 06:49:09.395
I think we need to think broadly about what the entire plan

06:49:11.156 --> 06:49:17.382
is supposed to do to give direction to the schools and districts about the things they should pay attention to.

06:49:17.983 --> 06:49:33.137
Choosing to move this money is something we have great flexibility to do, but that's a kind of the salutary neglect that I talked about and criticized districts for previously, that we would actually be giving tacit agreement to that it's okay to do that.

06:49:34.318 --> 06:49:34.518
Yeah.

06:49:34.618 --> 06:49:44.042
Remember, we're talking about the 1.8 million dollars here, which is in the state, not the 21st century grants, not... Yeah, it's about 37 cents per student.

06:49:44.103 --> 06:49:44.603
I understand.

06:49:44.643 --> 06:49:44.783
Yeah.

06:49:44.803 --> 06:49:45.003
OK.

06:49:45.123 --> 06:49:46.524
I understand that's budget dust.

06:49:46.584 --> 06:49:48.625
I'm just saying there is a message.

06:49:48.745 --> 06:49:49.205
I got it.

06:49:50.405 --> 06:49:52.446
But we're not moving all of the Title IV.

06:49:52.466 --> 06:49:53.187
Right.

06:49:53.427 --> 06:49:53.827
OK.

06:49:54.227 --> 06:49:55.688
I'd like to get a motion.

06:49:56.908 --> 06:50:02.531
So this is fairly complex because... Did you want to say something?

06:50:04.190 --> 06:50:05.012
Okay, so.

06:50:10.085 --> 06:50:10.265
Yes.

06:50:13.041 --> 06:50:17.783
Sure.

06:50:18.804 --> 06:50:25.507
To your point earlier, President Kirsch, you said that this plan is, you know, nested in a much, lots of other decisions.

06:50:26.067 --> 06:50:30.529
To come are decisions about set-asides across the titles.

06:50:31.089 --> 06:50:34.731
So, I'm not understanding why we have to make a decision about Title IV

06:50:35.831 --> 06:50:46.060
right now because it's, at least for me, I would like to see what else is available, what other options, what other initiatives might come forward for those set-asides.

06:50:46.361 --> 06:50:48.042
This seems kind of isolated to me.

06:50:48.062 --> 06:50:49.203
Yeah, Barbara can answer that.

06:50:49.223 --> 06:50:52.366
I think it has something to do with the template, you know, and the deadline.

06:50:52.746 --> 06:51:01.114
There are two sections in the template where it specifically asks, and one's in Title 2a and one's in Title 4a, how are you planning to use your state-level activity funds?

06:51:06.894 --> 06:51:07.635
Nobody knows.

06:51:09.356 --> 06:51:10.596
The big money they did.

06:51:10.616 --> 06:51:17.100
The big money in Title I, they put in another section of ESSA so it doesn't relate to the template.

06:51:18.221 --> 06:51:21.123
I would have integrated the two if I were writing the law.

06:51:21.263 --> 06:51:23.785
There are no state level activity funds for Title I.

06:51:24.985 --> 06:51:28.549
So there's the required 7% for support and intervention.

06:51:29.269 --> 06:51:34.474
And I'm not sure why they didn't ask for Title III, but this is our third template.

06:51:35.194 --> 06:51:49.547
I don't know what made the cut or didn't as we moved from Template 2.0 to 3.0, but the template specifically asks states to describe how you are spending your Title II state-level activity money and your Title IV state-level activity money.

06:51:52.403 --> 06:51:53.504
OK, board members.

06:51:53.924 --> 06:51:54.324
Thank you.

06:51:55.685 --> 06:51:59.247
So thank you, Barbara, for all your work on this.

06:51:59.547 --> 06:51:59.967
Thank you.

06:52:01.428 --> 06:52:09.792
And I also want to thank the stakeholders as well, who have followed this process for a year and a half and provided such great feedback.

06:52:10.292 --> 06:52:15.995
I know that there are folks who are out there who are still disappointed with this, this plan.

06:52:16.015 --> 06:52:19.037
And however,

06:52:20.541 --> 06:52:46.344
must understand that this just because it's not the state plan is not fleshed out as much as you would have liked to have seen it that the state's commitment to closing the achievement gap and our commitment to California system of accountability and continuous improvement which is steeped in equity the work does not go on and I think from the previous three items we see how much work we

06:52:47.284 --> 06:53:05.335
Have done and then we'll continue to and there is a commitment I think from everyone along this around this dais to make sure that happens So with that I'm going to start with my motion in three chunks one starting with just the technical changes And then we'll move forward from there.

06:53:06.055 --> 06:53:07.616
So the first motion is

06:53:08.777 --> 06:53:20.646
is to move CDE's recommendation to make the technical corrections to the draft plan identified during the staff presentation and to add a response to the new appendix B as follows.

06:53:21.907 --> 06:53:23.848
And I think many of you have it in front of you.

06:53:23.868 --> 06:53:26.410
So I'll just read on page 29, revised to read.

06:53:29.562 --> 06:53:52.520
The ELPI baseline data is based on student progress between the 2014 and 2015 CELT administration and the number of students reclassified in 2014 for status compared to the student progress between 2013 and 2014 CELT administrations and the number of students reclassified in 2013 for change.

06:53:59.064 --> 06:54:11.488
Then on page 39, revised to read, this performance level will be used as part of the criterion when determining schools under consideration of a comprehensive support in addition to the lowest 5%.

06:54:15.310 --> 06:54:25.193
And then three, four, the new appendix B, add the proposed language reflected in the handout distributed by staff, which everyone should have received.

06:54:29.842 --> 06:54:31.483
Okay, that was the first motion one.

06:54:31.963 --> 06:54:33.044
Do I have a second for that?

06:54:33.104 --> 06:54:34.385
These are largely technical.

06:54:35.966 --> 06:54:37.307
Any board discussion on this?

06:54:37.327 --> 06:54:40.890
Okay, all those in favor, raise your hands.

06:54:40.910 --> 06:54:43.111
Okay, that carries unanimously.

06:54:44.983 --> 06:54:58.112
So motion two, move to revise the draft plan to insert language referencing the California English Learner Roadmap in the discussion of SEA support for English learner progress under title three on page 82 as follows.

06:55:00.493 --> 06:55:16.083
Additionally, in response to a recent voter-approved ballot initiative, the California Education for a Global Economy Initiative, Proposition 58, and other changes in state and federal policy related to English learners, the California Department of Education will issue

06:55:17.123 --> 06:55:19.785
the California English Learner Roadmap.

06:55:20.186 --> 06:55:38.681
This resource will include guidance on how LEAs and schools can implement and strengthen comprehensive evidence-based programs and services for all profiles of English learners that enable the access to college and career-ready learning, as well as opportunities to attain the state seal of bi-literacy.

06:55:38.701 --> 06:55:42.243
Okay, that's motion two.

06:55:42.344 --> 06:55:43.344
Do we have a second to that?

06:55:43.865 --> 06:55:45.026
Second, Ortiz-Lacon.

06:55:45.686 --> 06:55:46.447
Board discussion?

06:55:47.793 --> 06:55:49.515
Hearing none, raise your hand for that one.

06:55:49.655 --> 06:55:50.777
Okay, that carries.

06:55:54.341 --> 06:55:54.821
I made the motion.

06:55:55.322 --> 06:55:58.145
Okay, motion three.

06:55:58.245 --> 06:56:01.769
Okay, now motion three includes several items and

06:56:04.465 --> 06:56:13.252
Let's see, I'm wondering, given some of the discussion on the Title IV, should I pull that out or just, okay, I'll just go through and then we can have a discussion on it.

06:56:13.653 --> 06:56:31.787
Okay, move, I move that the State Board approve the ESSA State Plan for submission to the Federal Department of Education on September 18th, 2017, with the changes covered by Motion 1 and Motion 2, and the following substantive revisions.

06:56:32.848 --> 06:56:41.653
A, revise the definition of curriculum frameworks in the glossary on pages 3 through 4 as specified in item attachment 2.

06:56:44.935 --> 06:56:53.461
Revise the section on disproportionate rates of access to educators on page 50 through 52 as specified in item attachment 2.

06:56:56.676 --> 06:57:05.445
Revise the section on state-level activities for Title IV, Part A, student support and academic enrichment grants to state.

06:57:08.396 --> 06:57:32.774
California intends to transfer the Title IV Part A state-level activities funds to Title II Part A to support state-level activities under Title II Part A beginning in the 2018-2019 fiscal year, subject to meaningful consultation with all relevant stakeholders around the intended use and any equitable distribution requirements.

06:57:34.153 --> 06:57:47.149
And I'm making that motion because while I hear the superintendent's recommendation, I feel that we do still have a lot of work in the core supporting our educators and

06:57:49.269 --> 06:57:55.635
It's a matter of do we spread out the money a little bit more or do we double down on a specific area?

06:57:55.815 --> 06:58:04.063
And we're not really doubling down because it's not a lot of money, but it is concentrating our funds to hopefully get more work done.

06:58:05.635 --> 06:58:28.339
And then the last piece of this motion, very long motion three, is delegate authority to the State Board of Education Executive Director to approve the final revisions directed by the SBE under number one above and correction of any typographical errors.

06:58:28.359 --> 06:58:31.120
Okay, is there a second to that motion?

06:58:33.746 --> 06:58:33.946
Okay.

06:58:34.346 --> 06:58:36.027
Any further discussion on that motion?

06:58:38.868 --> 06:58:39.209
Okay.

06:58:40.649 --> 06:58:41.910
All right.

06:58:41.930 --> 06:58:48.013
I think you ought to call the roll on this because this is the overall approval of the Tulsa State Plan.

06:58:48.313 --> 06:58:48.593
Okay.

06:58:48.613 --> 06:58:50.014
We'll do this in alphabetical order.

06:58:50.094 --> 06:58:52.035
So we have Sue Burr.

06:58:52.675 --> 06:58:52.755
Aye.

06:58:54.136 --> 06:58:54.796
Jayden Gray.

06:58:54.816 --> 06:58:55.676
Aye.

06:58:56.877 --> 06:58:57.537
Bruce Holliday.

06:58:57.557 --> 06:58:57.957
Aye.

06:58:59.038 --> 06:58:59.638
Mike Kirst.

06:59:00.018 --> 06:59:00.158
Aye.

06:59:01.579 --> 06:59:03.020
Elisa Ortiz-Licon.

06:59:03.240 --> 06:59:03.320
Aye.

06:59:05.612 --> 06:59:06.412
Patricia Rucker?

06:59:06.432 --> 06:59:06.813
No.

06:59:08.013 --> 06:59:08.894
Nikki Sandoval?

06:59:10.934 --> 06:59:10.994
Aye.

06:59:11.014 --> 06:59:11.735
Eileen Strauss?

06:59:12.155 --> 06:59:12.255
Aye.

06:59:13.055 --> 06:59:13.676
Ting Sung?

06:59:13.696 --> 06:59:14.316
Aye.

06:59:15.296 --> 06:59:15.997
Erin Valdez?

06:59:17.618 --> 06:59:17.698
Aye.

06:59:17.718 --> 06:59:19.198
And Trish Williams is absent.

06:59:20.019 --> 06:59:21.379
So the motion passes.

06:59:21.439 --> 06:59:22.340
The motion passes.

06:59:22.480 --> 06:59:22.740
All right.

06:59:22.800 --> 06:59:25.621
So we are done with the ESSA.

06:59:25.641 --> 06:59:27.222
That is the ESSA state plan.

06:59:27.302 --> 06:59:28.102
So we'll do that.

06:59:35.456 --> 06:59:36.517
Okay.

06:59:37.738 --> 06:59:44.723
So now we're going to move to the waivers and it's in three parts.

06:59:44.943 --> 06:59:53.910
These are consent votes, two consent votes and one individual action that will be pulled out, which is waiver 19.

06:59:55.511 --> 06:59:56.232
So I'd like

06:59:57.774 --> 07:00:04.136
Motion on waiver consent votes on waivers 1 and waiver 3 through 18.

07:00:05.757 --> 07:00:06.177
So moved.

07:00:06.197 --> 07:00:08.617
Is there a second?

07:00:11.939 --> 07:00:12.699
Second on that.

07:00:14.239 --> 07:00:15.360
Patricia, sorry.

07:00:16.500 --> 07:00:18.261
One second to make sure we have the order correct.

07:00:18.401 --> 07:00:19.541
Just please one second.

07:00:23.992 --> 07:00:25.032
Did you get the revisions?

07:00:25.373 --> 07:00:25.573
No.

07:00:25.913 --> 07:00:27.093
No, you didn't read it that way.

07:00:27.113 --> 07:00:29.253
I didn't think so.

07:00:29.273 --> 07:00:31.274
Okay, the waiver consent vote.

07:00:33.915 --> 07:00:40.636
Waiver one, W3 through W13, W15 through W18.

07:00:43.137 --> 07:00:44.477
So moved.

07:00:44.757 --> 07:00:45.477
Second on that.

07:00:47.478 --> 07:00:47.818
All right.

07:00:47.858 --> 07:00:48.958
All those in favor, vote.

07:00:51.286 --> 07:00:55.527
Okay, now we need Rucker recruitment.

07:01:02.209 --> 07:01:05.489
Okay, there'll be no staff presentation on this.

07:01:07.750 --> 07:01:12.351
It is only separated out because of recruitment of board member Rucker.

07:01:20.370 --> 07:01:23.532
So I need then a motion to approve this.

07:01:23.712 --> 07:01:24.132
So moved.

07:01:26.354 --> 07:01:26.694
Second.

07:01:26.714 --> 07:01:29.495
Okay.

07:01:31.136 --> 07:01:31.396
All right.

07:01:31.416 --> 07:01:33.938
So all those in favor of that, raise your hands.

07:01:38.260 --> 07:01:38.541
Okay.

07:01:38.581 --> 07:01:41.562
Now we have two waivers for individual action.

07:01:42.883 --> 07:01:44.764
Waiver 14 and waiver 19.

07:01:45.485 --> 07:01:47.846
And we will have staff presentations on those.

07:01:49.392 --> 07:01:52.555
So who is presenting for the staff on Waiver 14?

07:01:53.416 --> 07:01:53.857
Kristen.

07:01:54.578 --> 07:01:55.338
Kristen Wright.

07:01:55.358 --> 07:02:05.169
I never saw this.

07:02:05.189 --> 07:02:06.790
Yeah, they just handed it to us.

07:02:06.850 --> 07:02:07.932
It's brand new.

07:02:10.394 --> 07:02:11.976
President Kirst, members.

07:02:13.601 --> 07:02:16.063
I'm Kristen Wright, Director of the Special Education Division.

07:02:16.083 --> 07:02:16.704
Nice to see you.

07:02:17.385 --> 07:02:26.733
This is nothing new for you in the sense of this is a set of RSP teacher caseload waivers and

07:02:28.976 --> 07:02:47.897
essentially we're looking at four separate waivers and these essentially are what you've seen in the past which is within that 32 student caseload and we have a recommendation with conditions which include

07:02:48.417 --> 07:02:51.619
having the right kinds of support to those teachers.

07:02:52.059 --> 07:02:59.183
As you know, I just wanted to point out that you're all very painfully aware of the shortage that we're facing in the state.

07:02:59.744 --> 07:03:05.607
And I think there is promise around the conversations that are happening at the Commission on Teacher Credentialing.

07:03:05.988 --> 07:03:08.669
There are solutions that are being discussed.

07:03:09.189 --> 07:03:12.711
In the meantime, as my staff goes out to monitor,

07:03:13.812 --> 07:03:16.094
This is typically how these waivers come to us.

07:03:16.874 --> 07:03:19.216
They're not people calling in to ask for a waiver.

07:03:19.556 --> 07:03:35.046
They're typically either a complaint has come in and part of a corrective action is that they come before you and ask for a waiver or we've done a monitoring visit and there's been a larger caseload and that's another recommendation coming out of our monitoring visits.

07:03:35.527 --> 07:03:36.707
So, just wanted to point that out.

07:03:37.688 --> 07:03:42.211
So, if there are not any other questions, our recommendation again is approval with conditions.

07:03:43.212 --> 07:03:43.492
Thank you.

07:03:46.740 --> 07:03:48.244
Is there public comment on this one?

07:03:50.670 --> 07:03:52.174
Angela Daramus from CTA.

07:03:54.295 --> 07:03:54.955
Hi.

07:03:55.095 --> 07:03:59.237
We're asking, CTA is asking for this item to be pulled from the consent calendar.

07:03:59.997 --> 07:04:13.743
According to state, to Ed Code 33051A7, state board makes an exception to waiver approval when the exclusive representative of employee was not a participant in the development of this waiver.

07:04:14.483 --> 07:04:21.807
In this case, Moreland Teachers Association is the exclusive representative and they were not a participant in the development of this waiver.

07:04:22.407 --> 07:04:29.911
Accordingly, CTA is opposing this on the basis that is not in the best interest of Moreland students, nor does it fit in with the collective bargaining agreement.

07:04:30.311 --> 07:04:33.112
For these reasons, we ask you to remove this item from the consent calendar.

07:04:37.514 --> 07:04:38.435
Yeah, it is removed.

07:04:38.455 --> 07:04:39.595
That's why we're discussing it.

07:04:39.695 --> 07:04:40.336
Right, exactly.

07:04:41.539 --> 07:04:46.768
Yeah, so we're, yeah, we understand and you gave the reasons that you're opposed.

07:04:47.589 --> 07:04:48.611
Do I have a motion on this?

07:04:53.194 --> 07:04:56.555
I guess I have a question before making a motion.

07:04:57.815 --> 07:05:01.456
In the waiver itself, it does say that the association was consulted.

07:05:01.496 --> 07:05:03.957
There was a position of neutral on the waiver.

07:05:04.177 --> 07:05:04.577
They were not.

07:05:04.597 --> 07:05:06.757
So if you could just clarify that on Moreland.

07:05:07.057 --> 07:05:16.479
So the information that we received from the district that they submitted to us for the waiver said that there was a neutral position and it gave a date and the name of the person that they talked to.

07:05:17.380 --> 07:05:22.781
So I'm happy to look into additional information if the board so would like me to do that.

07:05:24.158 --> 07:05:25.859
But that's the information that we were provided.

07:05:27.259 --> 07:05:28.079
Board Member Rucker.

07:05:30.961 --> 07:05:37.863
My understanding because this was forwarded to me and I attempted to send it to Judy.

07:05:38.523 --> 07:05:40.124
I'm having problems with sending this.

07:05:40.564 --> 07:05:43.985
My understanding is that the association was not consulted.

07:05:44.385 --> 07:05:50.808
That in fact, the superintendent has told the association that they are not required to consult with them on these waivers.

07:05:51.468 --> 07:06:00.395
And so what the, so what's written on the form and what the association has that was actually told by the superintendent is two different things.

07:06:00.855 --> 07:06:10.943
So I don't believe the association and I'm, I don't believe the association intends that the entire waiver item for the other three LEAs listed would be held.

07:06:11.344 --> 07:06:20.751
They're asking that the waiver request from Moreland be removed from board action today so that you would have an opportunity to look into it.

07:06:22.182 --> 07:06:23.023
And we're happy to do that.

07:06:23.043 --> 07:06:26.886
OK, so then I would have a motion.

07:06:26.906 --> 07:06:28.587
Go ahead, Member Sandoval.

07:06:28.667 --> 07:06:37.473
Yeah, so I looked at the other ones and what I would like to do is in this particular waiver 14, remove Moreland from the list.

07:06:39.335 --> 07:06:45.599
And I would move approval of the CD's recommendation to grant the waiver requests for Claremont and Jefferson.

07:06:47.241 --> 07:06:48.862
But remove Moreland for further.

07:06:48.882 --> 07:06:51.484
OK, is there a second to that?

07:06:51.997 --> 07:06:52.577
I'll second it.

07:06:53.818 --> 07:06:54.158
Okay.

07:06:54.438 --> 07:06:55.298
Further discussion?

07:06:55.418 --> 07:06:56.919
All those in favor, raise your hands.

07:06:58.220 --> 07:06:58.680
Okay.

07:06:59.020 --> 07:06:59.700
That carries.

07:06:59.760 --> 07:07:00.781
Waiver 19.

07:07:03.002 --> 07:07:06.283
Charter School Program, Baldwin Park Unified School District.

07:07:13.752 --> 07:07:17.894
Good afternoon Board President Kuerst, Chief Deputy Superintendent Price, and members of the Board.

07:07:17.974 --> 07:07:22.615
I'm Cindy Chan, Director of the Charter Schools Division at the California Department of Education.

07:07:23.936 --> 07:07:35.300
Item W19 includes a request by Baldwin Park Unified for a waiver on behalf of their Charter School Opportunities for Learning in Baldwin Park, a non-classroom based charter school.

07:07:35.880 --> 07:07:44.373
give you really brief background on this for the new board member and just to kind of give you recollection as to these types of waivers that we bring forward to you.

07:07:45.185 --> 07:07:57.975
There was a specific case in Shasta County that was litigated involving a non-classroom based charter school operating resource center outside the geographic boundaries of its authorized school district but within the same county.

07:07:58.676 --> 07:08:06.822
The school district where the resource center was located filed suit contending the location of this resource center was in violation of California law.

07:08:07.943 --> 07:08:13.748
Fast forward to January 2017, the litigation was appealed.

07:08:14.169 --> 07:08:24.017
The Third District Court of Appeals court opinion of Anderson Union High School District versus Shasta Secondary Home School, which we refer to as the Anderson decision.

07:08:24.677 --> 07:08:36.367
became final at that time, which held that geographic restrictions pursuant to specified statutes apply to non-classroom-based charter schools operating resource centers.

07:08:37.128 --> 07:08:49.478
Thus, in order to ensure compliance with the court opinion, a non-classroom-based charter school resource center must operate within the boundaries of its authorizing school district unless an exception applies.

07:08:50.178 --> 07:08:54.740
Additionally, the charter school may establish a resource center in an adjacent county.

07:08:55.800 --> 07:09:03.102
The mid-year timing of this final decision, however, was thought to be problematic for some schools to come into immediate compliance.

07:09:03.843 --> 07:09:15.447
Therefore, in March of this year, this board approved Waiver Policy 1701-01, entitled Non-Classroom-Based Charter School Resource Center Location.

07:09:16.787 --> 07:09:33.219
So regarding this request, Baldwin Park Unified as the chartering authority is requesting on behalf of OFL Baldwin Park to allow the non-classroom based charter schools resource centers to operate outside of its geographic boundaries but within the county.

07:09:34.580 --> 07:09:41.486
There was one waiver request submitted by the district that includes seven resource centers for this charter school.

07:09:42.407 --> 07:09:45.610
Five are included in waiver item 17.

07:09:46.510 --> 07:09:49.213
I think you moved that one on consent.

07:09:50.013 --> 07:09:55.519
as those resource centers, those five resource centers for the charter school met the policy criteria.

07:09:56.300 --> 07:10:05.168
However, two in our review did not meet the criteria and so we've pulled them out of the other item and included it separately in this item.

07:10:05.569 --> 07:10:10.634
That way the other item is very clean and it follows the waiver policy that was approved.

07:10:13.095 --> 07:10:19.938
Consistent with the policy, Baldwin Park Unified submitted the following information as detailed in Attachment 1.

07:10:20.378 --> 07:10:33.763
They provided the address of each resource center, the school district in which each resource center is located, the date each resource center was established, and the number of students attending each resource center.

07:10:34.783 --> 07:10:38.385
In addition, they also provided the discussion for the need of the waiver.

07:10:39.625 --> 07:10:44.929
In our review of the policy, we determined that two resource centers did not meet the criteria.

07:10:44.949 --> 07:10:50.713
And I'm going to break them out because they're very similar in terms of their location.

07:10:51.233 --> 07:10:54.355
The first one, 3939 Atlantic Avenue, suites 101, 113, 114, 116 in Long Beach.

07:10:54.375 --> 07:10:57.417
The resource center was established in 1999.

07:10:57.537 --> 07:11:02.020
It's located in the boundaries of the Long Beach Unified School District.

07:11:09.906 --> 07:11:15.470
and in 2016-17 served 228 students and staffed 16 employees.

07:11:16.311 --> 07:11:23.617
The facility that they operated in was leased from a third party with plans to relocate in April 2017.

07:11:24.218 --> 07:11:26.960
This resource center was closed effective April 14, 2017.

07:11:29.842 --> 07:11:45.239
Therefore, we find that the waiver request for this resource center, 3939 Atlantic Avenue, does not comply with the policy since the charter school no longer operates the resource center and pursuant to the policy, the waiver shall not be retroactive.

07:11:46.360 --> 07:12:02.646
The second resource center in this request, 3501 Atlantic Avenue, also located in Long Beach, was established in 2015 with the intention of expanding the 3939 Atlantic Avenue Resource Center, the one I just mentioned.

07:12:04.166 --> 07:12:14.936
It's also located in the boundaries of Long Beach Unified, and it was opened for students on April 18th, so three days after the other resource center closed.

07:12:15.637 --> 07:12:21.802
The students and employees from the 3939 Atlantic Resource Center were moved to this one.

07:12:22.883 --> 07:12:34.611
Because the 3501 Atlantic Avenue Resource Center began operationally serving students subsequent to the policy approved by the state board on March 9th.

07:12:35.091 --> 07:12:46.118
The waiver request for this resource center does not comply with the policy because the policy applies to existing resource centers and this one was operated after that day.

07:12:46.918 --> 07:13:09.630
However, we find that the charter school operated the 3939 Atlantic Avenue Resource Center during the effective period of the policy and that the transition to the 3501 Atlantic Avenue Resource Center, both located within the same district, Long Beach Unified, occurred within a reasonable time period.

07:13:10.250 --> 07:13:11.731
Therefore, we recommend approval.

07:13:13.012 --> 07:13:24.543
of the Charter School Resource Center identified in Attachment 1, specifically 3501 Atlantic Avenue in Long Beach with the following conditions that's pursuant to the policy.

07:13:24.563 --> 07:13:36.694
The first one is to require the Charter School's governing body to approve a transition plan that details how the Charter School's Resource Center will come into compliance with the Anderson Court decision.

07:13:37.635 --> 07:13:48.679
Two, pursuant to Education Code Section 33051B, the waiver shall expire on June 30, 2018 and shall not be retroactive.

07:13:49.880 --> 07:14:02.365
Three, require the charter school to submit the transition plan to the authorizing school district, Baldwin Park Unified, and to all school districts identified in Attachment 1, and in this case it's Long Beach Unified.

07:14:02.925 --> 07:14:07.607
where the resource center is located within 30 days after approval of the waiver.

07:14:08.548 --> 07:14:12.909
Four, require the charter school to provide a status update to parents.

07:14:13.230 --> 07:14:22.634
And five, if the authorizer has not visited the resource center identified in attachment one pursuant to education code section 47604.32,

07:14:26.215 --> 07:14:31.157
A2, require the authorizer to visit the resource center within a reasonable time frame.

07:14:31.777 --> 07:14:33.458
So that concludes my presentation.

07:14:33.518 --> 07:14:34.939
I can answer any questions you have.

07:14:36.659 --> 07:14:38.400
Are there any questions on this board member?

07:14:40.561 --> 07:14:43.202
As I understand, there's no monkey business going on here.

07:14:43.262 --> 07:14:48.404
They are going to have to comply with the Shasta ruling just the way all these other organizations are.

07:14:48.944 --> 07:14:53.646
And they just got trapped in this situation, timing situation of a planned move

07:14:54.951 --> 07:15:06.517
from one facility to another, but it does not change our basic waiver policy and the basic obligation of this organization.

07:15:06.577 --> 07:15:09.238
And therefore, I would move the staff's recommendation.

07:15:09.258 --> 07:15:10.399
Is there a second?

07:15:11.980 --> 07:15:12.340
Second.

07:15:12.520 --> 07:15:12.880
Okay.

07:15:13.000 --> 07:15:14.381
Any board discussion?

07:15:23.928 --> 07:15:25.008
Okay.

07:15:26.309 --> 07:15:28.729
Is there any... I'm getting hungry again.

07:15:28.789 --> 07:15:32.750
I just wanted to... He gets up early.

07:15:32.770 --> 07:15:34.730
I go to bed early.

07:15:34.770 --> 07:15:36.211
So I apologize for the record.

07:15:36.231 --> 07:15:37.011
Yeah.

07:15:37.511 --> 07:15:38.811
Any public comment on this?

07:15:40.192 --> 07:15:42.092
If not, all those in favor, raise your hands.

07:15:42.332 --> 07:15:42.572
All right.

07:15:43.372 --> 07:15:44.093
That carries.

07:15:44.133 --> 07:15:44.573
Thank you.

07:15:45.753 --> 07:15:48.714
So now we're on to proposed consent calendars.

07:15:48.814 --> 07:15:50.354
And as far as I know, there is no

07:15:51.054 --> 07:15:52.435
None of these have been polled.

07:15:53.076 --> 07:15:56.319
So, first of the proposed... Wait.

07:16:01.743 --> 07:16:02.183
Oh, yes.

07:16:02.464 --> 07:16:02.864
Okay.

07:16:02.924 --> 07:16:04.205
We have some abstentions.

07:16:04.225 --> 07:16:18.657
Proposed consent.

07:16:21.621 --> 07:16:22.603
So we have some.

07:16:22.623 --> 07:16:24.526
All right.

07:16:27.812 --> 07:16:31.259
So we have proposed waiver consent calendar includes.

07:16:31.439 --> 07:16:32.201
Yeah.

07:16:40.046 --> 07:16:40.346
Okay.

07:16:40.406 --> 07:16:41.267
Yes, we have.

07:16:41.287 --> 07:16:42.167
Yeah, there we go.

07:16:43.068 --> 07:16:46.470
We have three of these because of recusal.

07:16:46.530 --> 07:16:51.574
So the first consent vote for item five.

07:16:54.495 --> 07:16:56.977
Sue, Ting, Karen recusal.

07:16:57.217 --> 07:16:59.419
So item five.

07:16:59.439 --> 07:17:04.102
Okay.

07:17:04.142 --> 07:17:05.162
And we're voting on.

07:17:07.138 --> 07:17:14.503
consolidated applications for Menifee Union Elementary, Natomas Unified and Oakland Military Institute.

07:17:15.123 --> 07:17:18.606
So these are these are proposed consent items.

07:17:19.466 --> 07:17:23.829
And we had some board members need to recuse.

07:17:24.770 --> 07:17:25.430
But they're out.

07:17:25.590 --> 07:17:25.890
All right.

07:17:25.990 --> 07:17:26.311
All those.

07:17:26.551 --> 07:17:27.832
Is there a motion?

07:17:29.633 --> 07:17:32.795
Since I was associated with OMI in the past, is that a concern?

07:17:34.924 --> 07:17:35.125
Great.

07:17:35.305 --> 07:17:35.885
Then I move.

07:17:36.766 --> 07:17:37.106
So move.

07:17:37.126 --> 07:17:38.807
Second.

07:17:40.928 --> 07:17:43.169
Is there any board member discussion?

07:17:45.831 --> 07:17:46.151
Okay.

07:17:46.732 --> 07:17:48.333
All those in favor, raise your hands.

07:17:48.373 --> 07:17:48.973
We're going to need.

07:17:48.993 --> 07:17:49.793
Okay.

07:17:49.914 --> 07:17:50.674
We have all of us.

07:17:50.834 --> 07:17:51.194
Okay.

07:17:51.274 --> 07:17:51.955
That carries.

07:17:51.995 --> 07:17:52.235
Yeah.

07:17:54.656 --> 07:17:54.917
Okay.

07:17:54.957 --> 07:17:58.499
Now we need a second consent vote for item five.

07:17:59.539 --> 07:18:00.000
And these are

07:18:02.549 --> 07:18:05.011
Eileen and Feliza.

07:18:06.292 --> 07:18:08.814
And these are for the county school district codes.

07:18:09.575 --> 07:18:10.115
Patricia.

07:18:10.536 --> 07:18:15.580
Yeah, Con Apps, but... Okay.

07:18:15.820 --> 07:18:16.100
Yeah.

07:18:19.063 --> 07:18:19.483
All right.

07:18:19.543 --> 07:18:26.749
These are for Con App items submitted by LEAs as noted in attachments.

07:18:28.872 --> 07:18:30.073
Everything but those three.

07:18:30.173 --> 07:18:30.573
Okay.

07:18:30.693 --> 07:18:32.855
All other consolidated applications.

07:18:33.896 --> 07:18:34.336
So moved.

07:18:37.178 --> 07:18:37.558
Second.

07:18:38.058 --> 07:18:38.939
Second Sandoval.

07:18:41.100 --> 07:18:42.081
Any board discussion?

07:18:42.361 --> 07:18:43.882
If not, it's consent.

07:18:43.982 --> 07:18:44.663
Raise your hands.

07:18:44.943 --> 07:18:45.323
Okay.

07:18:45.463 --> 07:18:46.124
Those go.

07:18:54.209 --> 07:18:57.592
And now we have the consent vote item six through sixteen.

07:18:59.173 --> 07:19:00.877
No recusals needed for this.

07:19:01.658 --> 07:19:03.502
We do have public comment on nine.

07:19:04.103 --> 07:19:05.666
Okay, public comment on nine.

07:19:08.992 --> 07:19:09.774
And on fourteen.

07:19:19.005 --> 07:19:26.729
It's nice to see the staff now including in the application process acknowledgement of school board members as practitioners.

07:19:27.829 --> 07:19:31.231
We bring some really valuable experience to these committees, I believe.

07:19:31.651 --> 07:19:33.712
We're glad to see that as a consideration.

07:19:33.772 --> 07:19:34.152
Thank you.

07:19:40.515 --> 07:19:41.055
Item 14.

07:19:41.275 --> 07:19:41.796
Is this on?

07:19:41.916 --> 07:19:43.697
Which item are you seeing?

07:19:43.717 --> 07:19:44.177
14 or later.

07:19:44.770 --> 07:19:45.632
Speaking on item 14.

07:19:45.792 --> 07:19:48.558
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

07:19:49.200 --> 07:19:55.594
We're concerned about the recommendation to cut the funding for the Twin Ridges Charter School, tiny charter school up in the

07:19:56.335 --> 07:19:59.598
up in the foothills above Grass Valley.

07:20:00.038 --> 07:20:14.331
They have been building up their budget reserve because they serve, one of the major populations they serve comes out of the Beale Air Force Base and depending on deployments and other stuff, their population can go anywhere from 80 to 160 kids.

07:20:16.392 --> 07:20:20.775
And naturally, riding that fluctuation is kind of difficult for them.

07:20:21.356 --> 07:20:27.460
Beefing up their reserves cause them to miss the 40 and 80 percent expenditure targets that are normally needed.

07:20:28.661 --> 07:20:33.544
We think that that's a lousy reason to cut their funding, particularly by 30 percent.

07:20:34.885 --> 07:20:39.968
And we think that this is a type of policy that you folks have spoken about before.

07:20:40.589 --> 07:20:43.571
It all comes out of regulations that are within your control.

07:20:44.595 --> 07:20:54.646
And there's been a lot of talk about fixing the regulations so we don't give bad incentives to schools to make bad financial decisions, but currently the regulations do.

07:20:55.427 --> 07:21:00.292
And we think, number one, we would recommend full funding for this school.

07:21:00.672 --> 07:21:04.496
Number two, we would urge you to crack open those regulations.

07:21:05.066 --> 07:21:08.288
They've been festering for years and giving schools bad incentives.

07:21:08.388 --> 07:21:16.052
I hate to have to tell my membership to spend down their reserves, particularly when we're likely to have a recession sometime in the relatively near future.

07:21:16.232 --> 07:21:16.552
Thank you.

07:21:17.812 --> 07:21:18.773
Board Member Holliday.

07:21:20.694 --> 07:21:25.496
I appreciate Mr. Premak's comments, in particular, his point number two.

07:21:25.796 --> 07:21:33.600
Once again, I do agree that these regulations are outdated, that they're awkward and that they do not serve children as well as they should.

07:21:33.921 --> 07:21:34.661
That being said,

07:21:35.763 --> 07:22:03.033
I disagree with his first point in that the ACCS met went over this item very carefully and in their conclusion they felt as though there was ample opportunity for this school to appeal this decision to the CE and prove that they have currently met the spending requirements

07:22:03.753 --> 07:22:08.978
and are continuing to, this is all based on prior years of spending.

07:22:10.159 --> 07:22:20.769
And so once again that they are in compliance and that it is with that assurance that they will likely not receive

07:22:21.750 --> 07:22:29.976
If they go through this process and are successful, which likely that will be the case, they will not actually have a reduction in their spending based upon the timing.

07:22:30.376 --> 07:22:37.481
So, the ACCS looked at it very carefully and decided to go with the CDE recommendation and that's why I agree as well.

07:22:38.762 --> 07:22:39.002
Okay.

07:22:39.322 --> 07:22:40.503
Are you willing to make a motion?

07:22:40.603 --> 07:22:41.264
Well, let's see.

07:22:42.505 --> 07:22:43.665
We have two that we've heard.

07:22:43.746 --> 07:22:47.028
So, are we ready for a motion on all of the proposed consent items?

07:22:48.669 --> 07:22:49.069
So move.

07:22:49.450 --> 07:22:49.850
Okay.

07:22:50.270 --> 07:22:50.651
Second.

07:22:50.991 --> 07:22:51.351
Second.

07:22:51.772 --> 07:22:52.853
Any further discussion?

07:22:53.974 --> 07:22:55.295
All those in favor, raise your hands.

07:22:56.196 --> 07:22:57.137
Okay, that carries.

07:22:57.257 --> 07:23:07.646
So we're done with proposed consent and we're on to our final item, which is item 17, State Board Projects and Priorities.

07:23:08.227 --> 07:23:10.008
So I need a motion to approve the minutes.

07:23:11.109 --> 07:23:11.670
Move approval.

07:23:11.690 --> 07:23:14.873
All right, all those in favor?

07:23:16.431 --> 07:23:22.638
Okay, then I'm going to go down the usual list here, starting with next generation science standards, Strauss.

07:23:24.840 --> 07:23:32.002
So the early implementers of Next Generation Science Standards do a summer institute for teachers.

07:23:32.042 --> 07:23:33.863
They also do it for admin leaders.

07:23:34.403 --> 07:23:42.485
So they had a, I was in Dublin, Northern California on July 27th and in Palm Springs on August 3rd.

07:23:43.005 --> 07:23:45.806
Great energy, really excitement.

07:23:46.987 --> 07:23:51.848
The K-12 Alliance did an amazing job of leading the work and just one comment out of

07:23:52.728 --> 07:23:54.609
I just did an update on where we were in science.

07:23:54.649 --> 07:23:57.550
But I think one of the things I saw was so effective.

07:23:57.570 --> 07:24:00.971
They're trying to help leaders understand where the shifts are in science.

07:24:01.311 --> 07:24:09.213
And so science coaches are taking principals and leaders through classrooms, coaching them on how to find

07:24:09.793 --> 07:24:11.695
the practices and find evidence.

07:24:11.755 --> 07:24:17.542
So it's really a great coaching strategy to grow the leader skills to recognize that.

07:24:17.602 --> 07:24:21.186
So that was a very, very exciting process.

07:24:22.047 --> 07:24:23.188
And then I'll just add,

07:24:24.870 --> 07:24:28.694
on August 16th, the Math and Science Collaboration Committee.

07:24:28.754 --> 07:24:37.602
So there's a larger community of practice that I talked about before that's 100 science practitioners and 100 math, but this is the 35 or so.

07:24:38.082 --> 07:24:47.811
And they met together in San Diego, and they're actually pushing very hard to have math and science begin to work together more collaboratively and have their meetings on the same days.

07:24:48.231 --> 07:24:50.032
so that they cross-fertilize the work.

07:24:50.213 --> 07:24:56.277
And so they talked about high quality math instruction, high quality work at the county level.

07:24:56.737 --> 07:25:00.220
What does it mean for standards implementation for both science and mathematics?

07:25:00.240 --> 07:25:01.401
So very, very exciting.

07:25:01.701 --> 07:25:05.404
Their next meeting is October 18th and 19th up here in Sacramento.

07:25:06.705 --> 07:25:07.145
OK.

07:25:08.126 --> 07:25:09.166
Charters, holiday.

07:25:09.186 --> 07:25:12.769
That will be tomorrow.

07:25:12.809 --> 07:25:12.909
OK.

07:25:14.050 --> 07:25:16.392
California Teacher Commission, Straus.

07:25:16.860 --> 07:25:36.193
So just real quickly, the CTC met last week and I just want to bring up, and probably Member Sandoval is aware of this, but as a result of the 2016 research report on special educators, there's a lot of talk about and work on updating the credentialing requirements and training for

07:25:37.034 --> 07:25:40.378
teachers who teach students with a variety of disabilities.

07:25:40.698 --> 07:25:47.005
There's been strong work by the work groups and two recommendations and there's not agreement right now from the work groups.

07:25:47.446 --> 07:25:54.234
And basically there's an agreement there should be a common core or what they call a common trunk of coursework that all teachers have.

07:25:54.634 --> 07:26:13.484
special ed and regular ed, but there is a discussion about whether there should be a double credential required for special educators when in fact we're having a hard time getting people into special ed and the length of time and the work and also talking about the need for induction standards and work around this.

07:26:13.544 --> 07:26:21.729
So there will be a study session at the October CTC meeting where they're going to try in a public session to bring both work groups together and come to an agreement.

07:26:22.069 --> 07:26:29.015
but for people who care a whole lot about special ed and understand how important it is to credential and train teachers.

07:26:29.575 --> 07:26:32.658
There's not an agreement right now and they didn't want to rush the decision.

07:26:32.978 --> 07:26:36.081
They did expand early childhood from birth to kindergarten.

07:26:36.401 --> 07:26:38.103
So, that happened as well.

07:26:39.043 --> 07:26:43.587
And so, I'll bring you up to date as more information comes.

07:26:43.607 --> 07:26:46.109
Okay.

07:26:46.930 --> 07:26:48.031
CCEE Burr.

07:26:51.677 --> 07:27:01.344
You heard a lot about CCEE this morning, so I won't bore you with the details except to say that our next meeting is Wednesday, October 4th, here in this room.

07:27:02.225 --> 07:27:03.746
Invite anybody who would like to come.

07:27:03.806 --> 07:27:08.049
It's always a good opportunity to hear, especially from what's going on in the field.

07:27:08.729 --> 07:27:15.554
I would like to take this opportunity, President Kirst, in my role as the chair of the screening committee for the State Board,

07:27:16.014 --> 07:27:17.875
We're in fall recruitment season.

07:27:18.696 --> 07:27:23.679
And so I just want to make sure people are aware that we're recruiting for three advisory committees.

07:27:24.680 --> 07:27:28.202
The first one is CPAG, the California Practitioners Advisory Committee.

07:27:28.722 --> 07:27:40.350
And we're looking for applicants who meet one or more of the practitioner categories of education researchers, teachers from charter schools, or representatives of private school children.

07:27:40.830 --> 07:27:43.952
And the deadline for application is Wednesday, October 12th.

07:27:44.853 --> 07:27:49.814
We're recruiting for a parent member for the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools.

07:27:49.834 --> 07:28:01.918
So we're looking for an individual who is a parent or guardian of a student who is currently attending a charter school and representatives of the District Governing Board to serve on the ACCS.

07:28:02.558 --> 07:28:05.440
The deadline for that is Thursday, October 12th.

07:28:06.480 --> 07:28:09.482
We're also recruiting for the Instructional Quality Commission.

07:28:10.302 --> 07:28:24.089
We're looking for four appointments from currently practicing teachers and or leaders with experience in special education, elementary grades, mathematics, and or ethnic studies, which is a new piece of work we're doing.

07:28:24.689 --> 07:28:28.090
And those applications are due Wednesday, October 11th.

07:28:28.610 --> 07:28:32.131
And finally, I always like to do this on the first meeting of our student board member.

07:28:32.191 --> 07:28:34.411
We're recruiting for the next student board member.

07:28:36.231 --> 07:28:45.133
As you know, it always happens in conjunction with the state student leadership convening in November.

07:28:45.573 --> 07:28:49.754
So, we're looking for student members who are interested in being on the state board.

07:28:50.214 --> 07:28:52.955
And that deadline is Thursday, October 12th.

07:28:53.155 --> 07:28:58.676
So, make sure that you let people know because we like to have a robust set of applications for all of our committees.

07:28:58.936 --> 07:28:59.296
Thank you.

07:28:59.316 --> 07:29:00.416
Okay.

07:29:00.456 --> 07:29:03.817
California Practitioners Advisory Group.

07:29:04.718 --> 07:29:12.939
So, the member Valdez and I attended and a lot of the items we gave feedback on, on today's accountability items.

07:29:13.900 --> 07:29:14.580
Do you want to comment?

07:29:16.509 --> 07:29:23.878
I just will reinforce that there was a strong feeling about the surveys being every other year versus... On climate.

07:29:24.018 --> 07:29:24.598
On climate.

07:29:24.638 --> 07:29:25.860
That definitely came up.

07:29:26.981 --> 07:29:27.361
Okay.

07:29:27.822 --> 07:29:29.444
English learners, Ortiz-Lacombe.

07:29:31.725 --> 07:29:34.227
There is a meeting for the EO roadmap.

07:29:34.287 --> 07:29:35.708
I believe it's at the end of the month.

07:29:35.868 --> 07:29:38.750
Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend as I will be in Nashville.

07:29:39.190 --> 07:29:43.132
But I think that it would be a great idea if board member Valdez attends.

07:29:43.232 --> 07:29:47.995
That meeting will be to provide guidance on how to implement the policy we adopted proposition.

07:29:48.015 --> 07:29:49.937
I'm sorry, the EO roadmap.

07:29:50.197 --> 07:29:54.079
So that will be building towards the document that LEAs will receive.

07:29:54.680 --> 07:29:54.980
Thank you.

07:29:56.761 --> 07:29:56.881
Okay.

07:29:57.021 --> 07:29:58.202
Environment holiday.

07:29:59.500 --> 07:30:02.061
Well, I don't actually report on the environment.

07:30:02.141 --> 07:30:10.945
If I did, I think I would report that she's pretty upset these days and the result we're seeing.

07:30:11.345 --> 07:30:21.930
But instead, I report on the Environmental Literacy Steering Committee and the efforts to infuse environmental literacy across the disciplines in the state of California.

07:30:22.510 --> 07:30:39.757
And in that regard, once again, we've recently seen how terribly environmental literacy is important, especially to underserved, low-income communities who are almost always the ones who suffer the most in an environmental disaster.

07:30:40.413 --> 07:30:55.013
But the good news is that thanks to the state legislature and Governor Brown, another significant step has been taken on behalf of environmental literacy, and that is through an allocation

07:30:56.914 --> 07:31:11.339
of $4 million for the Superintendent of Public Instruction to provide grants to a local education agency or consortium of local education agencies to establish the California Regional Environmental Education Community Network known as CREEC.

07:31:11.980 --> 07:31:19.983
And this funding allows CREEC to implement a new vision, a new mission, and a new strategy for environmental literacy throughout the state.

07:31:21.721 --> 07:31:22.421
That's good news.

07:31:24.142 --> 07:31:27.624
IQC, ELA, ELA Strauss.

07:31:27.844 --> 07:31:36.589
So there's a collaboration committee for ELA, ELD that's also been meeting and that group meets again October 12th.

07:31:37.230 --> 07:31:49.757
They're talking about looking at the framework and grounding practice, looking at resources for foundational skills, looking at a system to support alignment with materials and the framework, which I talked a little about before.

07:31:50.217 --> 07:32:07.402
And then some lessons they're learning on implementation that in professional development, bite-sized chunks seem to work the best, that we have to build capacity, that teachers have to own the work, and that leaders have a responsibility to lead literacy improvement, and that we really are focusing on good first instruction.

07:32:08.082 --> 07:32:10.943
So, really an exciting group of people.

07:32:11.843 --> 07:32:14.444
Again, it's about 35 people that meet together.

07:32:15.124 --> 07:32:16.385
and we're talking about next steps.

07:32:16.545 --> 07:32:26.408
I just want to add on, because it's not on the list, the Social Emotional Learning group met on Monday and Deputy Price was there as well.

07:32:27.128 --> 07:32:28.129
It's an exciting group.

07:32:28.209 --> 07:32:31.070
We're part of a state, used to be eight states.

07:32:31.090 --> 07:32:34.811
I think we're 19 now in a national consortium on social emotional learning.

07:32:35.411 --> 07:32:43.177
And we're looking at practices that promote strong learning with guiding principles and to develop a compendium of resources.

07:32:44.138 --> 07:32:46.720
And this group meets again on January 22nd.

07:32:46.740 --> 07:32:51.424
And in between the meetings, they do have calls and planning sessions.

07:32:51.524 --> 07:33:04.754
So Deputy Price might want to add to it, but it was a really exciting talking about how to integrate it, how it works with our work in school climate and teacher practices to support it, what things we need to do for teachers and

07:33:05.354 --> 07:33:11.223
school leadership Hey IQ see the health framework Ortiz Lacombe

07:33:12.079 --> 07:33:16.403
Yes, and I want to thank Stephanie for providing talking points.

07:33:16.844 --> 07:33:24.351
I did give extensive feedback on the chapters and I have to say I'm very proud of the framework that we're developing.

07:33:24.612 --> 07:33:27.294
It's very comprehensive, very progressive.

07:33:27.414 --> 07:33:35.002
We discuss health disparities and looking at not only the physical health but also the environment and what contributes to some of the health

07:33:35.542 --> 07:33:38.664
issues that we see in communities and in particular communities of color.

07:33:38.804 --> 07:33:42.366
So I want to say that I'm very proud of what we're working and working with.

07:33:43.646 --> 07:33:54.232
In terms of the Health Education Curriculum Framework and Evaluation Criteria Committee, they are meeting next week for the fourth time and please feel free to submit or attend.

07:33:54.592 --> 07:33:59.595
And if you want to submit comments, healtheducationframework at cde.california.gov.

07:33:59.995 --> 07:34:00.195
Thanks.

07:34:01.454 --> 07:34:18.338
Okay, IQC History, Social Science and I asked board member Rucker to talk about the money we got for implementing this from the legislature, which was not in the governor's budget, but we're happy to have it.

07:34:18.578 --> 07:34:24.600
And so this is quite interesting and she's going to talk a little bit about what's been going on with this.

07:34:24.620 --> 07:34:25.920
This is a whole new grant program.

07:34:28.076 --> 07:34:30.316
My microphone says it's on, so I hope you can hear me.

07:34:37.199 --> 07:34:39.580
I need a big strong man to come and turn on my microphone.

07:34:41.381 --> 07:34:42.041
It's on now?

07:34:42.281 --> 07:34:42.622
Okay.

07:34:44.803 --> 07:34:45.283
Thank you.

07:34:46.663 --> 07:34:47.884
Thank you, whoever he is.

07:34:50.762 --> 07:34:54.504
So I'm very excited to be here today to talk to you about this money.

07:34:55.125 --> 07:34:58.567
And I get to be the person who's the bearer of excellent news.

07:34:58.987 --> 07:35:05.851
And in saying that, I will say any hard questions you have, they go to the department staff, Stephanie and Tom.

07:35:06.171 --> 07:35:09.153
But I'll answer the easy question and tell you about the funding.

07:35:10.073 --> 07:35:27.136
In the time that I have been on the board, the legislature has given a very clear messages about their intent in implementing the changes in the curriculum and the direction this board has tried to go in improving and changing our school program.

07:35:27.156 --> 07:35:34.558
The first time we saw that was the funding that they gave to implement and develop a statewide plan for implementing the Common Core.

07:35:35.138 --> 07:35:46.801
and then they gave funds in the budget that were a line item to support LEA initiatives for providing training to teachers to implement curriculum in English language arts and mathematics.

07:35:47.521 --> 07:36:00.785
Since that time, and in my time on the board, we have worked together to create a new English language arts framework, a mathematics framework, and with the rollout and the implementation of those frameworks, our department staff has been notable

07:36:01.525 --> 07:36:08.350
and received a great deal of praise for the rollout activities that they created in support of doing this work.

07:36:09.031 --> 07:36:10.472
So here we are today.

07:36:11.553 --> 07:36:30.528
The legislature provided specific language within the Budget Act and it asked the state superintendent to contract with the County Office of Education to coordinate the work to develop professional development activities in support of the implementation of the history social science framework.

07:36:31.048 --> 07:36:40.841
The legislature in particular calls for professional learning activities and resources aligned with the framework and the health education framework.

07:36:40.881 --> 07:36:44.546
So, Board Member Ortiz-Lincoln, I want you to know we're hooked up.

07:36:46.403 --> 07:36:53.792
Specifically, the opportunities and resources should focus on but not be limited to a number of different topics.

07:36:53.892 --> 07:37:04.626
What's notable about and very important about the social science framework is not just the controversy behind the development of the curriculum, but in some of the ways it attempts to resolve

07:37:05.166 --> 07:37:10.968
or create some consensus around how to have conversations about these issues.

07:37:11.389 --> 07:37:27.595
The health framework has also chosen to step into that controversy pool by identifying some very hard to teach and hard to talk about subjects and bringing it into the mainstream of instruction for students.

07:37:28.885 --> 07:37:51.310
So choosing to fund these activities and to fund the rollout and support of professional development for these frameworks is the state's very clear fingerprint, imperator on how to do this, but also to create leadership and guidance on this curriculum, not only as a subject, but for a topic that actually will frame not only our way of thinking,

07:37:51.670 --> 07:38:00.154
but inform an entire generation of students who will matriculate through our school system and then become those who become the policymakers later on.

07:38:00.194 --> 07:38:02.475
So this is our fingerprint on the future.

07:38:03.115 --> 07:38:09.638
In providing these resources and in providing this training, it also gives the opportunity to be innovative.

07:38:09.678 --> 07:38:11.739
So it's not just about in-person training.

07:38:12.059 --> 07:38:19.242
It's about the way we grow the resources that are available to teachers, both online and in other ways that the information can be delivered.

07:38:20.478 --> 07:38:33.242
This is an opportunity for LEAs to participate in professional learning that not only enhances their knowledge, but also builds capacity to create an understanding about the instructional shifts in both content areas.

07:38:33.682 --> 07:38:35.662
Teachers now can recite from memory.

07:38:35.722 --> 07:38:37.983
What are the instructional shifts for teaching math?

07:38:38.423 --> 07:38:41.284
What are the three instructional shifts for teaching English language arts?

07:38:41.744 --> 07:38:57.103
There were some very clear instructional shifts in the history of social science framework that is anchored in not just teaching history, but in teaching content across the subject areas so that we are integrating the work that we do.

07:38:57.941 --> 07:39:22.772
This funding further provides the ability for districts to take advantage not only of the current research, but also opportunities for as it relates to the health framework to have an impact on the conversations about school climate and other issues that directly relate to how students see themselves and their work in the school and how the issues that are being developed in that framework matter to students in the school.

07:39:24.744 --> 07:39:39.652
Currently, there's an established partnership between the Department of Ed, the CDE, and CSESA that has created collaboration committees in the four subject areas, science, math, English language arts, and history, social science.

07:39:40.132 --> 07:39:51.978
The history, social science collaboration committee has developed framework rollout events and have already conducted a number of events with attendees ranging from 200 to 500 at each event.

07:39:54.259 --> 07:40:15.468
This funding allows the continuation of collaboration committees to do a deeper dive into the history of social science framework topics and to provide ongoing professional learning through the collaboration committee, through the community of practice events, and through the framework events, and also to develop something that we haven't seen in our adoption before.

07:40:15.908 --> 07:40:16.469
But to curate

07:40:17.809 --> 07:40:28.993
aligned instructional resources so that for history of social science, the adoption is actually a living element in the support of what teachers do in the classroom.

07:40:29.033 --> 07:40:33.895
So you heard earlier with teaching math, teachers use the book in their implementing curriculum.

07:40:34.315 --> 07:40:40.858
The goal and the hope in implementing history of social science is it's not just going to be centered around or anchored with the book.

07:40:42.546 --> 07:40:51.933
Going a little further, as we look at the health education framework, it's currently in development, as you just heard in the presentation from my colleague, Board Member Ortiz-Lincon.

07:40:52.453 --> 07:40:55.075
The committee is meeting for the fourth time next week.

07:40:55.535 --> 07:40:58.697
The chapters drafted are in the process of being revised.

07:40:59.358 --> 07:41:03.881
This funding presents a great opportunity to build the network of health educators

07:41:04.341 --> 07:41:09.923
and create a collaboration committee modeled after the current process we have in place.

07:41:10.323 --> 07:41:24.847
We have good models of practice and good ways of doing this work, so the health education framework will have the advantage of stepping down a footpath that's already well-tread, well-worn, and has worked quite well for us.

07:41:25.507 --> 07:41:37.410
Community of Practice events and the Health Education Framework rollouts will be developed through that similar committee collaboration process with the help of the Health Education Framework.

07:41:37.890 --> 07:41:46.072
And that will include likely some updated legislation like the California Healthy Youth Act, violence prevention, and sexual harassment.

07:41:46.992 --> 07:41:54.754
Establishing a Health Education Collaboration Committee will build capacity among our County Offices of Education and our LEAs.

07:41:56.713 --> 07:42:01.978
Finally, I will overall for me seeing this item in the budget was very exciting.

07:42:03.039 --> 07:42:04.540
People ask how did this happen.

07:42:04.800 --> 07:42:11.467
Somebody asked nicely and this is one of those times when I usually say it seemed like a good idea at the time.

07:42:11.487 --> 07:42:12.527
I don't mean it.

07:42:12.988 --> 07:42:15.790
This time it was a good idea at the time.

07:42:16.591 --> 07:42:18.272
LEAs across the state will benefit.

07:42:18.292 --> 07:42:35.898
It's an opportunity for teachers and our students to change the way we do teaching and learning about history, social science, but most importantly, to build a foundation about how we approach health education that can actually inform some of the conversations around our LCAP.

07:42:35.938 --> 07:42:38.159
So I stand here to answer any questions you may have.

07:42:39.008 --> 07:42:42.091
Yeah, the amounts of money, there were specific amounts.

07:42:42.252 --> 07:42:47.097
I know it was 5 million was earmarked for the online resources.

07:42:48.378 --> 07:42:52.903
And that was to be done by the California History.

07:42:52.923 --> 07:42:56.668
There was even a designated grant for that.

07:42:57.128 --> 07:43:00.231
Yeah, it's a total of, it's a total of ten million dollars in the budget.

07:43:00.271 --> 07:43:06.396
And yes, a significant portion of it is set aside for a specific development of specific online resources.

07:43:06.816 --> 07:43:11.279
The department is actually going to be doing the work with that in collaboration with that contractor.

07:43:12.520 --> 07:43:15.843
Yeah, and then the other parts of this, it's not online.

07:43:16.784 --> 07:43:21.968
The amounts of money, again, Mr. Adams is here from the California Department.

07:43:22.222 --> 07:43:25.665
Yeah, Tom Adams, Deputy Superintendent, Teaching and Learning Support Branch.

07:43:26.986 --> 07:43:38.394
Actually, there was $5 million that went to the California Historical Society to work with the California History Social Science Project in terms of developing some California specific resources.

07:43:38.854 --> 07:43:41.737
So that's a separate $5 million pot.

07:43:42.217 --> 07:43:43.338
And what's the other pot?

07:43:44.179 --> 07:43:52.768
Then you have the 10 million dollar pot, which is to actually support the implementation of the history social science framework and the health framework.

07:43:53.850 --> 07:43:54.470
Yeah, that's a lot of...

07:43:56.626 --> 07:43:59.628
Well, let's keep in mind too, this is Prop 98 fund.

07:43:59.668 --> 07:44:03.350
So, there does have to be an LEA designated to help carry that out.

07:44:04.191 --> 07:44:08.313
It's not part of the state operating fund in terms of the department.

07:44:08.373 --> 07:44:11.195
So, we will be looking for a partnership on that.

07:44:11.756 --> 07:44:13.036
Okay, good.

07:44:13.377 --> 07:44:13.997
Any questions?

07:44:15.058 --> 07:44:15.978
If not, thank you.

07:44:19.180 --> 07:44:21.402
So, shuffling papers here.

07:44:21.462 --> 07:44:22.963
Where is the next one?

07:44:24.850 --> 07:44:25.891
IQC next.

07:44:25.951 --> 07:44:26.151
Yeah.

07:44:26.571 --> 07:44:28.453
So I'll just make one comment on mathematics.

07:44:29.293 --> 07:44:40.281
I think those of us in the field realize that we need to continue to focus on all of our instructional practices, but that mathematics is going to require additional look and rethinking what we're doing.

07:44:40.321 --> 07:44:41.842
So there's a subcommittee that's going to be

07:44:42.402 --> 07:44:51.552
meeting to look at where we've seen promising practices and what we can learn about it as we know that LEAs are struggling with math progress.

07:44:51.852 --> 07:44:56.297
And so that'll be a priority that we'll report as we work for next step.

07:44:56.577 --> 07:45:00.441
Yeah, I'll be working with that committee on a separate and related item tomorrow.

07:45:00.481 --> 07:45:02.223
The board is going to be taking action

07:45:02.823 --> 07:45:05.946
on an item concerning regulations for an interim adoption.

07:45:06.747 --> 07:45:15.335
A lot of us are concerned and remain concerned about the criticism that the board received concerning the recommendations for the mass adoption last year.

07:45:15.355 --> 07:45:20.801
And part of that was in the way the process worked and how the criteria was used.

07:45:21.221 --> 07:45:24.043
in developing that particular work.

07:45:24.584 --> 07:45:31.229
And so in looking at those regulations and in looking at that board item, it's not an opportunity to revisit the adoption.

07:45:31.609 --> 07:45:36.153
It's an opportunity to think about our relationship with the publishers who did this.

07:45:36.833 --> 07:45:46.276
and to look at those, how those regulations can guide or allow the republishers of the materials we did adopt to respond to some of those concerns.

07:45:46.676 --> 07:45:53.159
So that work is ongoing and that work will continue for the math framework and for the math curriculum itself.

07:45:54.179 --> 07:45:56.640
Okay, IQC Strauss.

07:45:58.564 --> 07:46:05.071
I think just to know that people are continuing to help do readiness and understanding of the science framework.

07:46:05.351 --> 07:46:08.314
The materials will be reviewed next spring and summer.

07:46:08.334 --> 07:46:20.326
That'll come back to us a year from now for and what I've shared with districts is that gives you time to become a good SUMR and understand the standards so that when you look to adopt materials you understand

07:46:20.686 --> 07:46:21.327
what you're looking at.

07:46:21.347 --> 07:46:22.669
So that's where we are right now.

07:46:22.709 --> 07:46:24.091
There'll be continued work on it.

07:46:24.532 --> 07:46:30.541
And regions will be doing more activities this year as the second year of the collaboration committees.

07:46:31.923 --> 07:46:34.006
Joint Committee on Workforce Pathways.

07:46:35.663 --> 07:46:35.923
Great.

07:46:36.003 --> 07:46:39.386
So we will be having our fourth meeting tomorrow.

07:46:39.406 --> 07:46:40.727
I mean, sorry, Friday.

07:46:40.747 --> 07:46:54.997
And so we have thus far really just kind of taken a reconnaissance of the lay of the land, what types of CTE preparation programs are out there, how they're laid out, what are some partnerships.

07:46:55.377 --> 07:47:01.602
We've looked at what does a pathway look like from a student moving through.

07:47:02.182 --> 07:47:27.583
the different levels and then we also had a great session last time around data systems as board member Rucker had referred to as well and the lack of alignment or there are information out there that we really could do a lot more in making sure that we have data that is more cohesive aligned and will provide all the agencies more information that they need.

07:47:29.284 --> 07:47:34.168
So we are hoping to adopt some principles out of the work.

07:47:34.788 --> 07:47:40.592
And we're looking at some draft principles, we're hoping, by December, by our December meeting.

07:47:40.733 --> 07:47:57.025
And then from there, those principles will provide some guidance to us in how we will continue to work K-12 and the community colleges will work together in more cohesive pathways for our students to move into the workforce.

07:47:59.030 --> 07:48:00.695
Special Education, Sandoval.

07:48:02.482 --> 07:48:08.806
Before I address special education, I just want to follow up on the history of social science because I did attend some meetings.

07:48:08.866 --> 07:48:10.107
I just wanted to report back.

07:48:10.127 --> 07:48:10.628
Okay, good.

07:48:11.528 --> 07:48:22.195
So I observed some of the materials review sessions in late July, and I just wanted to acknowledge the commitment of the reviewers at the time and the care that they've invested in this process.

07:48:22.515 --> 07:48:30.140
And I also attended the public hearing on materials adoption on August 17th, and I heard testimony from more than 75 members of the public.

07:48:31.561 --> 07:48:33.122
I've got a lot to say.

07:48:33.302 --> 07:48:49.330
And some of the most compelling testimony was the youth voices, and particularly as they spoke about hostile climates on campus and the ignorance, unfortunately, that is still very much alive and well.

07:48:50.270 --> 07:48:59.335
And queer students, students of color still facing really just the residue of not having good information out there.

07:49:00.035 --> 07:49:01.556
So I needed to acknowledge that.

07:49:02.356 --> 07:49:24.044
And just the responsibility that we have to make sure that our materials are not only factually accurate, but that the images and the graphics associated that help tell the story are sensitively curing, which actually relates to your, this repository and these resources for teachers, so they have good information that's been vetted.

07:49:24.824 --> 07:49:27.305
And so I just wanted to make that point.

07:49:28.765 --> 07:49:32.849
And I think that it's really evolved in a positive way.

07:49:34.170 --> 07:49:37.693
And I look forward to more discoveries in our November meeting.

07:49:38.213 --> 07:49:42.397
But we still have some things to do to address the public's concerns for sure.

07:49:42.557 --> 07:49:49.623
And towards that end, the work that's happening with the frameworks already, the adopted history social science frameworks,

07:49:50.203 --> 07:50:00.814
On October 9th on Indigenous Peoples Day here at Sacramento State University for this year, this campus is convening a California Indian Curriculum Summit.

07:50:01.515 --> 07:50:06.119
And so the intention for this gathering is really to provide

07:50:07.020 --> 07:50:22.448
third and fourth grade teachers with some very carefully vetted, by California Indians, curricular resources, not only address the common core state standards, but the newly adopted history social science framework.

07:50:22.488 --> 07:50:23.509
So there are things happening.

07:50:23.989 --> 07:50:31.894
People in California taking leadership for really creating new curricular models and resources that will help teachers tremendously.

07:50:32.274 --> 07:50:36.396
So I just wanted to address that before I gave the special education report.

07:50:38.988 --> 07:50:50.192
I attended the Advisory Commission on Special Education and we heard a report on the success of trauma-informed care and the educational challenges in our juvenile justice systems.

07:50:50.772 --> 07:50:57.335
The student population among three facilities in the state is 600 youth in the juvenile justice system.

07:50:57.575 --> 07:51:00.856
Half of these students have not earned a high school diploma yet.

07:51:02.017 --> 07:51:03.878
So that's a big hurdle.

07:51:04.259 --> 07:51:09.144
And then 30% of the 600 students are eligible for special education services.

07:51:09.164 --> 07:51:12.187
So that's a very significant segment of that population.

07:51:12.207 --> 07:51:13.649
Of the 600, 21% are English learners.

07:51:16.992 --> 07:51:28.920
So we learned about evidence-based practices to address the trauma that these students, 90% of the students in our juvenile justice system report having survived at least one trauma.

07:51:29.961 --> 07:51:31.862
Many had multiple traumas to report.

07:51:32.422 --> 07:51:36.585
So that was a very important presentation for here.

07:51:37.406 --> 07:51:47.594
And then we also heard a report on the dyslexia guidelines to assist general and special education teachers and parents identify and assess pupils with dyslexia.

07:51:48.134 --> 07:51:53.818
And this really provides a starting point, the guidelines, which are published now on the CDE website.

07:51:54.599 --> 07:51:58.162
And it will hopefully provide guidance and support to our teachers.

07:51:59.525 --> 07:52:13.534
And then we heard from the California Department of Social Services on a more integrated approach to building systems of care for youth that involve education, mental health, public health, child welfare, and the justice system.

07:52:14.434 --> 07:52:19.197
And one ongoing challenge used to be the linkage between social services and education.

07:52:19.698 --> 07:52:22.159
So we still have, again, much to do there.

07:52:23.280 --> 07:52:27.683
But there are three anchors that were identified to this work, and that's an integrated training plan,

07:52:28.724 --> 07:52:32.808
integrated core practice model, and then interagency MOUs.

07:52:32.868 --> 07:52:38.755
And they're very specific, measurable milestones that work, and that is an ongoing process.

07:52:39.516 --> 07:52:43.580
And then we also heard an update on the competitive integrated employment blueprint.

07:52:44.581 --> 07:52:51.187
And that's ways to increase employment opportunities for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

07:52:51.868 --> 07:52:57.452
And that's a multi-agency effort between CDE, Department of Rehabilitation, and the Department of Developmental Services.

07:52:58.513 --> 07:53:03.698
And there's a goal to establish local partnerships, at least 13 in the short term,

07:53:04.338 --> 07:53:20.621
between LEAs, Department of Rehabilitation Districts, and regional centers in the next year, then there's a five-year goal to roll out more of these partnership agreements between 200 LEAs and their Department of Rehabilitation Districts and regional centers.

07:53:21.001 --> 07:53:29.783
And the goal, of course, is working for pay for at least minimum wage so that people have an equal opportunity to make a living wage.

07:53:31.294 --> 07:53:33.535
That was it for summer school for the arts.

07:53:33.655 --> 07:53:34.175
It's summer.

07:53:34.275 --> 07:53:35.636
So yes, it's summer.

07:53:35.656 --> 07:53:37.877
I'm delighted.

07:53:37.897 --> 07:53:48.741
Adrian Molina, who is an alum of the California State School, California State Summer School for the Arts, has written and co-directed Coco, which is a new Disney Pixar feature.

07:53:49.401 --> 07:53:55.406
about Miguel who is a boy who dreams of becoming a musician and he goes on this extraordinary fantastic journey.

07:53:55.867 --> 07:54:15.343
The filming in late November but the California State Summer School of the Arts Foundation is organizing a special pre-release screening at Pixar Animation Studios on November 6th and the proceeds will ensure that the school continues to provide the highest quality pre-professional training for emerging artists in California and the

07:54:15.663 --> 07:54:17.684
The list is really a who's who.

07:54:18.184 --> 07:54:20.606
Benjamin Bratt is one of the voices.

07:54:20.946 --> 07:54:24.107
And there are others, too, that are fantastic.

07:54:24.688 --> 07:54:30.310
And I also wanted to mention that the Visual and Performing Arts Standards revision is about to start.

07:54:30.851 --> 07:54:36.093
There's an online application for the Standards Advisory Committee that will be available this month.

07:54:36.393 --> 07:54:43.617
And the revisions will be based on the current National Core Arts Standards, which include the disciplines of dance, theater, music, and visual arts.

07:54:45.503 --> 07:54:46.424
Okay, good.

07:54:46.524 --> 07:54:47.545
That concludes that.

07:54:47.645 --> 07:54:50.828
And I have a very happy ending to this long day.

07:54:51.529 --> 07:54:55.333
That just now, you want to hear this Board Member Strauss.

07:54:55.873 --> 07:55:01.098
Board Member Klaus and Board Member Burr were confirmed by the California Senate for new terms, so.

07:55:07.445 --> 07:55:08.686
The Board is adjourned for today.
