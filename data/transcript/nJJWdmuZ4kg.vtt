WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Good morning, everyone.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.560
Seeing that board members are now, President Brooks, will you please call the roll to establish

00:12.560 --> 00:14.680
a quorum?

00:14.680 --> 00:15.680
Member Sun.

00:15.680 --> 00:16.680
Present.

00:16.680 --> 00:17.680
Vice President Strauss.

00:17.680 --> 00:18.680
Present.

00:18.680 --> 00:19.680
Member Rucker.

00:19.680 --> 00:20.680

00:34.680 --> 00:35.680
Member Bonacca.

00:35.680 --> 00:36.680
Present.

00:36.680 --> 00:37.680
Everyone's present.

00:37.680 --> 01:02.000
I hereby call the November 2021 meeting of the State Board of Education to order at

01:02.000 --> 01:05.880
8 31 a.m.

01:06.880 --> 01:11.040
I'd like to commence by saluting the flag and ask our student board member, Bonacca, will

01:11.040 --> 01:13.280
you please lead us to the Pledge of Allegiance?

01:13.280 --> 01:15.680
I'd love to.

01:15.680 --> 01:19.880
Can everyone please stand for the pledge?

01:19.880 --> 01:24.600
Ready, salute.

01:24.600 --> 01:30.520
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for

01:30.520 --> 01:39.600
which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

01:39.600 --> 01:45.440
Thank you.

01:45.440 --> 01:47.440
Thank you very much.

01:47.440 --> 01:55.680
I want to share as we begin the morning the bittersweet news that Pam Castleman has accepted

01:55.680 --> 02:00.480
a full-time position as associate faculty and coordinator of graduate research in the

02:00.480 --> 02:06.600
School of Education at Chesapeake University starting in January of 2022.

02:06.600 --> 02:11.480
In addition to supporting students conducting their master's research, she will help address

02:11.480 --> 02:16.680
the principal and teacher shortage by preparing the next generation of school leaders.

02:16.680 --> 02:21.040
She helps to focus her university research on her passion, which is the marriage of core

02:21.040 --> 02:23.560
academics with CTE.

02:23.560 --> 02:28.960
Pam began her work at the State Board of Education in 2017, and during that time she has been

02:28.960 --> 02:35.280
involved in numerous curriculum projects as well as CTE, and I want you to please join

02:35.280 --> 02:37.680
me in wishing her well.

02:37.680 --> 02:43.640
We appreciate all that she has done and look forward to this next chapter in her career

02:43.640 --> 02:46.240
in which she'll connect with us in a new way.

02:46.240 --> 02:50.120
Thank you, Pam.

02:50.120 --> 02:55.440
In terms of our own recruitment and selection in the State Board, we're seeking additional

02:55.440 --> 03:00.600
applications for two appointments to the Instructional Quality Commission from currently practicing

03:00.600 --> 03:07.560
teachers and or leaders with experience and expertise in mathematics, physical education,

03:07.560 --> 03:10.640
English language arts, English language development.

03:10.640 --> 03:16.680
As you know, the mathematics curriculum framework is coming through the process and will be

03:17.080 --> 03:22.320
followed by instructional materials adoption and recommendations, so that's a particularly

03:22.320 --> 03:24.560
pressing need.

03:24.560 --> 03:30.840
And applications will be screened based on the need for current upcoming IQC projects.

03:30.840 --> 03:35.520
The State Board is also seeking applications to fill one position on the Advisory Commission

03:35.520 --> 03:37.640
on Special Education.

03:37.640 --> 03:40.880
Preference will be given to applicants who are teachers or individuals affiliated with

03:40.880 --> 03:45.000
transition services or students with disabilities.

03:45.040 --> 03:51.320
The recruitment window for both the IQC and ACSE will be open from October 29th through

03:51.320 --> 03:54.360
December 1st, 2021.

03:54.360 --> 04:00.080
For more information, you can visit the SBE website under What's New.

04:00.080 --> 04:06.040
There are three items on the agenda that have agenda associated with them.

04:06.040 --> 04:11.440
Item one, the State Board of Education Screening Committee recommendations for appointments

04:11.520 --> 04:16.720
to the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools, California Practitioners Advisory Group, and

04:16.720 --> 04:19.200
the Instructional Quality Commission.

04:19.200 --> 04:25.520
Item two is the 2022-23 Student Board Member and the recommendation of three finalists

04:25.520 --> 04:29.320
for submission to the Governor for consideration and appointment.

04:29.320 --> 04:35.120
And item three is reports from the 2021 Student Advisory Board on Education.

04:35.120 --> 04:38.160
There are two public hearings on the agenda.

04:38.160 --> 04:45.000
Item eight, the 2021 Arts Education Adoption of K-8 Instructional Materials and Instructional

04:45.000 --> 04:47.320
Quality Commission recommendations.

04:47.320 --> 04:54.000
And item nine, the 2021 World Languages Adoption of K-8 Instructional Materials and Instructional

04:54.000 --> 04:57.120
Quality Commission recommendations.

04:57.120 --> 05:02.680
With respect to the consent calendar, the proposed waiver consent items are W-1 through

05:02.680 --> 05:09.400
W-11, and the proposed regular consent items are items 10 through 15.

05:09.400 --> 05:12.080
There are a couple of changes in the agenda.

05:12.080 --> 05:16.880
After item one, we will take up item four, the assessment contract, and then take up

05:16.880 --> 05:18.800
items two and three.

05:18.800 --> 05:25.720
And then we'll reopen item one for the State Superintendent's report when he arrives before

05:25.720 --> 05:29.280
resuming the agenda order with item five.

05:29.280 --> 05:34.560
And then later this afternoon after the regular consent vote, we will reopen item one to take

05:34.560 --> 05:39.540
up the SBE Screening Committee recommendations for appointments to the Advisory Committee

05:39.540 --> 05:44.800
on Charter Schools, California Practitioners Advisory Group, and the Instructional Quality

05:44.800 --> 05:45.800
Commission.

05:45.800 --> 05:50.160
At that time, we'll also take up action on the September minutes and receive the State

05:50.160 --> 05:53.520
Board Liaison Report.

05:53.520 --> 05:57.760
Members of the public wishing to call in for public comment should view the live stream

05:57.760 --> 06:03.320
of the meeting to know at what time public comment will occur for each item.

06:03.320 --> 06:07.800
Public comment may be provided by dialing the phone number, entering a participant access

06:07.800 --> 06:12.220
code, and then following each of the operator's prompts.

06:12.220 --> 06:15.480
Upon dialing in, callers will be added to a caller queue.

06:15.480 --> 06:20.040
The operator will notify callers when it is their turn to provide public comment.

06:20.040 --> 06:24.520
We'll also ask callers to please turn down the speaker volume of their computers if they

06:24.520 --> 06:29.520
are following the live webcast to avoid an echoing effect.

06:29.520 --> 06:33.680
Public comment will be limited to one minute for each speaker.

06:33.680 --> 06:38.440
And item 16 is the general public comment item, during which members of the public may

06:38.440 --> 06:44.680
provide comment on matters that are not specifically listed in the Board agenda.

06:44.680 --> 06:48.160
Board members, please mute your microphones when not speaking and keep your cameras on

06:48.160 --> 06:52.920
at all times, except during the scheduled breaks to ensure that we maintain a quorum

06:52.960 --> 06:55.080
throughout today's virtual meeting.

06:55.080 --> 06:59.640
For each item on the agenda, there will be an opportunity for you to raise your hands

06:59.640 --> 07:06.000
using the Zoom participant window if you'd like to ask a question or make a comment.

07:06.000 --> 07:14.600
And item one is our State Board priorities item, and I will give a brief report and then

07:14.600 --> 07:21.000
State Superintendent Tony Thurman will arrive in person shortly and later in the agenda

07:21.000 --> 07:23.920
will give his report.

07:23.920 --> 07:31.360
So at our last board meeting in September, I spoke about the successful efforts that

07:31.360 --> 07:37.460
we had undertaken to open schools safely in the midst of the Delta variant surge.

07:37.460 --> 07:42.240
The amazing efforts of our state's educators who have acted with such courage and determination

07:42.240 --> 07:48.840
and resilience, along with our focus on supporting schools with testing, vaccination supports,

07:48.840 --> 07:53.880
and universal masking have made us the safest state in the country for most of this intervening

07:53.880 --> 07:59.040
period with declining cases throughout most of the fall and one of the lowest rates of

07:59.040 --> 08:02.680
school closure due to outbreaks in the country.

08:02.680 --> 08:07.280
In fact, while California has 12 percent of the students in the country, we've had fewer

08:07.280 --> 08:12.040
than one percent of the nation's schools closures.

08:12.040 --> 08:16.680
Now as the weather is turning colder and more of our activities go inside, it is critically

08:16.680 --> 08:21.120
important that we continue our vigilance to end this pandemic.

08:21.120 --> 08:26.560
Case rates have begun to tick up again nationally and in California, almost entirely among the

08:26.560 --> 08:32.080
unvaccinated population, and we cannot afford to take our foot off the gas.

08:32.080 --> 08:38.400
With more than 75 percent of all Californians at least partially vaccinated and 83 percent

08:38.400 --> 08:44.120
of our 12 to 17 year olds vaccinated, we are making good progress at getting to the moment

08:44.120 --> 08:47.880
when we can get put this pandemic behind us.

08:47.880 --> 08:54.440
Yesterday CDC advisors recommended the Pfizer vaccine for children between ages 5 and 11

08:54.440 --> 09:00.340
and within hours of this vote, the CDC director signed off on the unanimous recommendation.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.760
This is exciting news.

09:02.760 --> 09:08.560
We're now awaiting the Western States Scientific Safety Review workgroup to weigh in and it's

09:08.560 --> 09:13.720
possible that children could start to be vaccinated by as soon as tomorrow.

09:13.720 --> 09:20.360
I'm hearing from many people that they are planning birthday vaccinations for their children.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.000
What a great present.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.940
And I personally hope that when my grandson turns five on September 6th, he will be able

09:27.940 --> 09:31.800
to get his birthday vaccination as well.

09:31.800 --> 09:36.760
As you know, California has been leading the nation in work to educate and engage families

09:36.760 --> 09:42.720
to provide accurate information about COVID to make vaccines as accessible as possible.

09:42.720 --> 09:47.860
There have been more than 3,000 school-based clinics to help get the vaccines to staff

09:47.860 --> 09:49.280
and families.

09:49.280 --> 09:52.940
We've offered districts funding to sponsor vaccine clinics.

09:52.940 --> 09:57.480
We've brokered partnerships with pharmacies and medical clinics, as well as after school

09:57.480 --> 10:03.080
programs, including a partnership between the Sierra Health Foundation and the Alliance

10:03.080 --> 10:09.280
for Boys and Girls Clubs to do 84 pop-up clinics statewide that are upcoming.

10:09.280 --> 10:13.600
We've worked with pediatricians to be sure they have vaccines on hand and more is planned

10:13.600 --> 10:15.080
for the coming months.

10:15.080 --> 10:20.520
If we can stay focused on mitigation measures in schools and vaccinations for all eligible

10:20.520 --> 10:24.640
Californians, we will reach the light at the end of this tunnel.

10:24.640 --> 10:32.400
And I just want to encourage everyone to stay focused, persevere, and keep our foot on the

10:32.400 --> 10:36.800
gas to get to that goal.

10:36.800 --> 10:41.440
In another major challenge, there are also some signs of progress, which I hope our education

10:41.440 --> 10:46.280
system here in California will contribute to in some major ways.

10:46.280 --> 10:51.280
This week, the United Nations Climate Conference has been convening in Scotland, with historic

10:51.280 --> 10:57.700
agreements being forged to cut methane emissions and stop deforestation and a renewed commitment

10:57.700 --> 11:02.560
on the part of the United States and many other countries to seriously address climate

11:02.560 --> 11:03.560
change.

11:03.560 --> 11:07.520
There is much more to do, and all of us need to play a part.

11:07.520 --> 11:11.640
In our state, we know well the dangers of climate change, and we experience them increasingly

11:11.640 --> 11:13.160
each year.

11:13.160 --> 11:18.400
In my first president's report in 2019, I acknowledged the one-year anniversary of both

11:18.400 --> 11:24.200
the Camp Fire in Paradise and Woolsey Fire in Ventura County, and I noted that six of

11:24.200 --> 11:31.360
the ten most destructive fires in California's history had occurred since October 2017.

11:31.360 --> 11:37.200
Here we are two years later, and now eight of the ten most destructive fires in California

11:37.200 --> 11:42.760
history have occurred since October 2017, including this summer's devastating Dixie

11:42.760 --> 11:44.640
Fire.

11:44.640 --> 11:48.960
Children who are growing up in California have experienced far too many days of hazardous

11:48.960 --> 11:55.160
air, evacuation orders, and in too many cases, loss of homes and even loved ones.

11:55.160 --> 12:00.040
The wildfires are only one impact of climate change in California.

12:00.040 --> 12:04.840
The drought that is deepening is another one, and the wild storm that dropped what

12:04.840 --> 12:10.960
meteorologists called a cyclone bomb on California and our neighboring states just a week ago

12:10.960 --> 12:12.760
is yet another.

12:12.760 --> 12:18.280
Our children are aware of these dangers and want to be part of the solution.

12:18.280 --> 12:23.120
When I gave that first report, the board took time to honor a group of energetic and impassioned

12:23.120 --> 12:29.680
Sonoma County middle school students who formed schools for climate action to urge and empower

12:29.680 --> 12:34.840
educators, students, and elected officials to speak up about climate change and to take

12:34.840 --> 12:38.960
all the steps we can at the state and local level.

12:38.960 --> 12:43.680
In addition to what our governor and legislature have done to set emission standards, incentives

12:43.680 --> 12:48.920
for solar power, and development of green technologies, schools have a very large role

12:48.920 --> 12:54.160
to play, both in the greening of campuses and the greening of the curriculum.

12:54.160 --> 12:59.120
I learned more about the possibilities and the role that we can play through my membership

12:59.120 --> 13:06.000
on the K-12 Climate Action Commission, sponsored by the Espen Institute, a bipartisan commission

13:06.000 --> 13:11.600
co-sponsored by former New Jersey Governor Christie Todd Whitman, a Republican, and former

13:11.600 --> 13:16.640
U.S. Secretary of Education John King, a Democrat, who convened others across party lines to

13:16.640 --> 13:21.640
consider what schools can do to arrest climate change.

13:21.640 --> 13:28.120
A little-known fact is that the nation's 480,000 school buses are the largest transportation

13:28.120 --> 13:30.360
fleet in the country.

13:30.360 --> 13:35.640
Moving to electric buses would be a transformational contribution to clean air, and Stockton Unified

13:35.640 --> 13:42.080
District has partnered with companies to transition to electric school buses through grants from

13:42.080 --> 13:46.880
the California Air Resources Board, the California Energy Commission, rebates from the local

13:46.880 --> 13:52.360
utility company, the district has built charging stations, acquired its first set of electric

13:52.360 --> 13:59.240
buses, and supporting more districts in making plans, accessing funding and building needed

13:59.240 --> 14:05.840
charging infrastructure could help our schools transition their school bus fleet to electric.

14:05.840 --> 14:09.760
Stockton also helps students promote energy efficiency within their schools through the

14:09.760 --> 14:12.600
Student Energy Patrol Program.

14:12.600 --> 14:17.840
When he spoke to the commission, the district's energy specialist, Gilbert Rosas, noted that

14:17.840 --> 14:24.240
the district is on track to save $22 million over the next 10 years through energy conservation,

14:24.240 --> 14:27.760
solar panels, and solar battery storage at schools.

14:27.760 --> 14:32.760
Students were part of the process of auditing the system and coming up with some of the

14:32.760 --> 14:38.040
strategies that the board was able later to adopt.

14:38.040 --> 14:43.040
In Santa Barbara Unified, the district has prepared schools to serve as community hubs

14:43.120 --> 14:48.120
in the event of power outages and extreme weather after experiencing a mudslide after

14:48.120 --> 14:53.560
a wildfire in 2018 that shut down the city for two and a half weeks and prevented students

14:53.560 --> 14:58.920
from getting to school, community and district leaders transformed the school buildings into

14:58.920 --> 15:04.440
solar microgrids that can use solar energy to maintain core functions in the event of

15:04.440 --> 15:08.160
power outages.

15:08.160 --> 15:13.640
The state and a number of districts are tackling another key issue associated with food production

15:13.640 --> 15:14.840
and waste.

15:14.840 --> 15:19.280
In addition to the farm to table incentive for schools initiated by the governor and

15:19.280 --> 15:23.280
the first partner, districts are taking up this mission.

15:23.280 --> 15:28.880
Oakland Unified has a sustainability manager who focuses on reducing food waste, creating

15:28.880 --> 15:33.040
a food share program at every school and increasing compost programs.

15:33.120 --> 15:38.920
San Diego Unified has a love food not waste program that takes food that's been prepared

15:38.920 --> 15:44.640
but not taken by students and makes it available for local hunger relief organizations.

15:44.640 --> 15:50.480
In the last few years, the program rescued more than 500,000 pounds of food from schools

15:50.480 --> 15:55.480
and eliminated 275,000 pounds of greenhouse gas emissions.

15:55.480 --> 16:03.000
I'm not sure if everyone understands the relationship between food preparation and

16:03.000 --> 16:06.200
disposal and greenhouse gas emissions.

16:06.200 --> 16:11.080
These are just a few examples of climate action ongoing at our local levels, supported by

16:11.080 --> 16:16.240
state resources like the California Air Resources Board grant funding to help increase access

16:16.240 --> 16:22.640
to electric school buses, Proposition 39's K-12 program, which provided five years of

16:22.640 --> 16:27.920
funding to increase energy efficiency and clean energy use in schools and help California

16:27.920 --> 16:36.840
achieve one certified, six verified, and 72 emerging net zero energy schools by 2019.

16:36.840 --> 16:40.280
And there are many student led actions to raise awareness.

16:40.280 --> 16:45.280
Just two months ago, high school students in San Diego County marched in downtown Chula

16:45.280 --> 16:50.480
Vista in San Diego to demand policies that would reduce carbon emissions.

16:50.480 --> 16:55.240
To deepen students' understanding of the issues, California state science standards

16:55.680 --> 17:00.040
include teaching about sources and solutions to climate change through the next generation

17:00.040 --> 17:05.920
science standards and two CTE pathways that explicitly address clean energy.

17:05.920 --> 17:10.780
We're also working to integrate environmental principles and concepts into the entire curriculum.

17:10.780 --> 17:16.240
So you'll see guidance on climate change instruction in the language arts and history social science

17:16.240 --> 17:20.000
curriculum frameworks, as well as the science framework.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.120
The state recently provided funding to San Mateo County to develop open access climate

17:25.120 --> 17:30.360
change and environmental justice curricula for all grades that are aligned to the concepts.

17:30.360 --> 17:36.960
We urge educators and local boards to be aware of and to use these curriculum resources,

17:36.960 --> 17:44.720
as well as to consider greening strategies as they make investments in infrastructure

17:44.720 --> 17:47.360
buses transportation.

17:47.360 --> 17:52.040
Looking at all of these existing successes, we have the opportunity to be a national leader

17:52.040 --> 17:57.720
and help support schools to become models for climate action, to reduce the footprint

17:57.720 --> 18:04.480
of this very large public sector, and to prepare students to lead a more sustainable future

18:04.480 --> 18:07.680
and succeed in the clean economy.

18:07.680 --> 18:13.040
And while we are working at the state level to expand these opportunities, educators and

18:13.040 --> 18:18.240
school board leaders at the local level can also ask themselves about whether their districts

18:18.240 --> 18:25.120
have a policy to ensure that school infrastructure, renovations, retrofits, systems replacements

18:25.120 --> 18:29.720
will support healthy sustainable learning environments, and we'll have more opportunities

18:29.720 --> 18:34.600
to ask those questions and to spend those resources when the infrastructure bill gets

18:34.600 --> 18:40.840
passed in the next few days and supports that kind of work throughout the country.

18:40.840 --> 18:47.480
We can ask ourselves about transportation and how to transition school bus fleets.

18:47.480 --> 18:54.960
We could ask ourselves about food and sustainable food use and composting and how we are using

18:54.960 --> 19:00.960
existing curricula and developing more ways for students to participate in evaluating

19:00.960 --> 19:05.080
and contributing towards sustainability in our schools.

19:05.080 --> 19:10.400
This is an important moment as more federal and state resources will be coming to support

19:10.400 --> 19:15.720
these questions to consider how we can, in our various roles, support our schools in

19:15.720 --> 19:21.600
providing a safe and healthy environment now and for our students' lifetimes.

19:21.600 --> 19:28.360
You all know how fragile mental health for our children has been over this last year,

19:28.360 --> 19:36.640
and these are factors that play into their view of their future and their mental health

19:36.680 --> 19:43.680
and capacity for hope and optimism as well as for a strong and bright future.

19:43.680 --> 19:52.320
So I wanted to raise these issues for us this month as we continue our task both to make

19:52.320 --> 19:59.560
our schools safe places and enable our students to move forward in productive ways in school

19:59.560 --> 20:02.080
and in their lives.

20:02.120 --> 20:09.440
And with that, I'm going to return to the agenda and take up Item 4.

20:09.440 --> 20:15.120
So we're jumping ahead to Item 4, which is the California Assessment of Student Performance

20:15.120 --> 20:20.360
and Progress and the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California.

20:20.360 --> 20:25.480
This is for approval of the proposed contract with Educational Testing Service for the

20:25.480 --> 20:33.480
administration of the CASP and the LPAC Assessments for California, and the CDE recommends that

20:33.480 --> 20:40.160
we approve this proposed contract and authorize CDE staff to make technical edits to the documents

20:40.160 --> 20:47.040
as needed prior to its execution, and the item will be presented by Cheryl Cotton and

20:47.040 --> 20:49.160
Mal Vang of the department.

20:49.160 --> 20:50.560
Cheryl, please begin.

20:56.320 --> 21:02.000
To Superintendent Thurmond, President Darling-Hammond, Vice President Strauss, and esteemed board members.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.600
I'm Cheryl Cotton, Deputy Superintendent of Instruction, Measurement, and Administration branch.

21:06.600 --> 21:13.080
I'll be co-presenting again with Mal Vang, Director of Assessment Development and Administration Division.

21:13.080 --> 21:18.640
We'll be presenting Item 4 as an action item seeking approval on proposed assessment contract

21:18.640 --> 21:22.720
with Educational Testing Service, or ETS.

21:25.480 --> 21:35.840
Today I will provide background information on the procurement process that led us to

21:35.840 --> 21:39.600
the proposed contract and budget being shared with you today.

21:39.600 --> 21:45.680
Mal Vang will share the recommended, I'm sorry, Mal Vang will share the recommendation being

21:45.680 --> 21:50.160
brought to you for approval and go over a high-level summary of the contract scope of

21:50.160 --> 21:51.600
work and budget.

21:55.600 --> 22:02.240
On April 20, 2020, the CDE released the California Assessment System Request for Qualifications,

22:02.240 --> 22:09.120
or RFQ, as a four-stage process to procure its next assessment contract for five administrations

22:09.120 --> 22:14.640
of the California Assessment System, the CASP and the LPAC, which is projected to begin

22:14.640 --> 22:23.640
July 1, 2020, I'm sorry, July 1, 2022, and continue through December 31, 2027.

22:23.800 --> 22:29.760
In June 2020, an evaluation team composed of staff from different divisions of the CDE

22:29.760 --> 22:35.600
and staff from local educational agencies, or LEAs, located in regions across the state,

22:35.600 --> 22:39.520
met to score the RFQ Stage 1 submissions.

22:39.520 --> 22:44.600
Two potential contractors successfully met the evaluation criteria to progress to Stage

22:44.600 --> 22:47.320
2 of the RFQ.

22:48.000 --> 22:54.800
In early August 2020, the CDE provided the California Assessment System RFQ Stage 2 mandatory

22:54.800 --> 23:00.960
demonstrations criteria to the two potential contractors who passed Stage 1.

23:00.960 --> 23:06.320
Using an evaluation process similar to Stage 1, the evaluation team composed of staff from

23:06.320 --> 23:12.160
different divisions of CDE and staff from LEAs from different regions across the state

23:12.200 --> 23:18.000
met in November 2020 to score the RFQ Stage 2 submissions.

23:18.000 --> 23:24.080
The two potential contractors that passed both Stages 1 and 2 moved forward to Stage

23:24.080 --> 23:32.520
3, were Educational Testing Service, or ETS, and National Computer Systems, NCS, Pearson,

23:32.520 --> 23:33.520
Inc.

23:33.520 --> 23:40.920
At its January 2021 meeting, the California State Board of Education, or SBE, authorized

23:40.960 --> 23:47.560
the CDE to request of Stage 3 a formal written submission from the potential contractors

23:47.560 --> 23:53.800
containing a proposed scope of work, a draft proposed budget, and a transition plan.

23:53.800 --> 23:58.880
The CDE received approval from the SBE to include the following goals and priorities

23:58.880 --> 24:03.320
in the Stage 3 draft scope of work from the potential contractors.

24:03.320 --> 24:04.720
1.

24:04.720 --> 24:10.120
To enhance the development and administration of high quality assessments of the California

24:10.120 --> 24:18.280
assessment system, i.e. summative, interim, and formative assessments, through the 2022-2027

24:18.280 --> 24:19.480
school years.

24:19.480 --> 24:20.560
2.

24:20.560 --> 24:26.840
To continue to improve the robust assessment system to ensure efficient, effective, and

24:26.840 --> 24:32.680
accurate results, with enhancements to support multiple administration modes.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.160
And 3.

24:34.160 --> 24:39.840
Explore and advance technology solutions that meet system capacity, performance, and usability

24:39.840 --> 24:42.960
to the greatest extent possible.

24:42.960 --> 24:51.760
On February 5, 2021, the CDE provided the California Assessment System RFQ Stage 3 formal

24:51.760 --> 24:57.520
written submission criteria to ETS and NCS Pearson.

24:57.520 --> 25:02.440
The formal written submission requirements included a proposed scope of work, a draft

25:02.440 --> 25:06.000
proposed budget, and a transition plan.

25:06.040 --> 25:10.760
The formal written submissions were received by May 3, 2021.

25:10.760 --> 25:17.800
As was done for Stages 1 and 2, the evaluation team met to score the RFQ Stage 3 submissions.

25:17.800 --> 25:22.800
First, the evaluation team rated each proposal for pass or fail on whether the submission

25:22.800 --> 25:26.280
met the RFQ Stage 3 criteria.

25:26.280 --> 25:31.800
Then the evaluation team scored the technical proposal for each potential contractor.

25:31.800 --> 25:38.200
During that step, the evaluation team scored the budget proposal for each potential contractor.

25:38.200 --> 25:44.440
After the RFQ Stage 3 submissions were scored, the evaluation team added the total scores

25:44.440 --> 25:50.120
for Stages 1, 2, and 3 to reach an overall technical score.

25:50.120 --> 25:56.120
To conclude the RFQ Stage 3, the evaluation team took each potential contractor's overall

25:56.200 --> 26:02.920
technical score and overall budget score and combined them to get an overall submission score.

26:02.920 --> 26:08.040
The potential contractors were then ranked on the basis of the outcome of this process,

26:08.040 --> 26:12.480
as was presented to the SBE in July 2021.

26:12.480 --> 26:16.600
ETS was the highest ranked potential contractor.

26:16.600 --> 26:25.040
At the July 2021 SBE meeting, the CDE received approval to begin Stage 4 negotiations with ETS.

26:25.080 --> 26:31.680
Representatives from the CDE, the SBE, and the Department of Finance held negotiation

26:31.680 --> 26:38.720
meetings with ETS in August, September, and October 2021, which culminated in a proposed

26:38.720 --> 26:48.280
contract, CN 220002, including the negotiated scope of work, the budget, supporting documents,

26:48.280 --> 26:52.720
and provisional items, I'm sorry, provisional terms and conditions.

26:52.720 --> 26:56.400
In that, you would see in Attachment 1-9.

26:56.400 --> 27:01.440
Mal will now cover the outcome of these negotiations in her portion of this presentation.

27:01.440 --> 27:02.400
Thank you, Mal.

27:13.200 --> 27:16.400
Sorry, gotta adjust my height here.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.400
Give me a minute.

27:23.680 --> 27:25.680
Thank you, Cheryl.

27:25.680 --> 27:32.080
As Cheryl mentioned, I'm Bao Vang, Director of the Assessment, Development, and Administration Division.

27:32.080 --> 27:34.880
Thank you for having me today.

27:34.880 --> 27:38.000
The recommendation is as follows.

27:38.000 --> 27:45.360
The CDE recommends that the State Board of Education, or SBE, approve the proposed contract

27:45.360 --> 27:50.720
with Educational Testing Service, or ETS, for the administration of the California Assessment

27:50.800 --> 27:56.320
of Student Performance and Progress, or CASP, and the English Language Proficiency

27:56.320 --> 28:02.240
Assessments for California, or LPAC, collectively known as the California Assessment System,

28:02.800 --> 28:08.400
and authorize CDE and SBE staff to make technical edits to the contract documents

28:08.400 --> 28:11.760
as needed prior to the execution of the contract.

28:12.400 --> 28:17.920
So, to set the context for the new contract, I will highlight some key information about

28:17.920 --> 28:23.120
the California Assessment System, which operates year-round with minimal downtime.

28:23.920 --> 28:35.600
So, it serves all 6.2 million of our students in the K-12 system, about 250,000 educators,

28:36.000 --> 28:42.960
our students in the K-12 system, about 250,000 educators access the system,

28:43.520 --> 28:49.280
and at about all of our 2,000 local educational agencies.

28:49.920 --> 28:57.920
It really delivers about 200 plus separate test titles, being administered about 20 million tests

28:58.480 --> 29:05.280
administered separately, and about 11 million scores reported year-round with online testing.

29:05.600 --> 29:17.280
This slide provides the estimated number of test takers across all of the assessment programs

29:18.960 --> 29:23.120
with the estimated number of test takers in the last column.

29:23.680 --> 29:27.760
And what we have in terms of these assessments is the Smarter Balanced Interims for

29:28.400 --> 29:35.520
English Language Arts, Literacy, and English and Math, or ELA and Math, excuse me.

29:35.520 --> 29:42.880
And this is really available to all 6.2 million students, even though it may be aligned to grades

29:42.880 --> 29:48.080
3 through 8 and 11 standards. Then we have the summative assessments, the Smarter Balanced

29:48.080 --> 29:54.160
summative assessments for ELA and Math, and that's available for grades 3 through 8 and 11.

29:55.120 --> 30:01.440
And then 3.2 million students access those assessments. Then we have the California

30:01.440 --> 30:08.480
Alternate Assessments, or CAAs, for ELA and Math. Again, in those similar grades of the same grades

30:08.480 --> 30:16.880
of 3 through 8 and 11, about 39,000 students take those assessments. And then the California

30:16.880 --> 30:23.440
Science Test is administered in grades 5, 8, and high school, once in high school, and about 1.4

30:23.440 --> 30:29.840
million students access that test. And then our California Alternate Assessments for Science,

30:29.840 --> 30:38.160
again in those same grades, grades 5, 8, and once in high school, about 16,500 students access that.

30:38.160 --> 30:44.320
We do have a Spanish assessment, California Spanish assessment, and it is estimated that

30:44.320 --> 30:50.800
about 40,000 students would be taking that test. And then we have summative LPAC, and that's

30:51.200 --> 30:57.200
available for K through 12. About 1.1 million students access that on an annual basis.

30:58.000 --> 31:05.280
Our initial LPAC, that is an assessment for new students to our state or the country,

31:06.000 --> 31:11.760
and has a language other than English, and about 200,000 students access that on an annual basis.

31:12.640 --> 31:21.120
We are operationalizing our summative and initial alternate LPAC in the current year,

31:21.120 --> 31:29.600
and we'll continue to offer that in future years. So going back to the, so to start off with in terms

31:29.600 --> 31:37.360
of the negotiated contract, I will explain how we are continuing the development administration

31:37.360 --> 31:41.600
and scoring and reporting of the current assessments that I've just mentioned.

31:42.320 --> 31:51.040
And all of these assessments are covered in this new contract. So having said that,

31:51.040 --> 31:55.680
since I've already mentioned all the assessments, let's just go on that in terms of

31:56.880 --> 32:02.960
the services for the assessments. In addition, the contract will also continue to do the reporting

32:02.960 --> 32:07.920
for all the assessments, including Lexile and quantum measures for the Smarter Balanced

32:07.920 --> 32:11.600
ELA and Mathematics, summative and interim assessments.

32:15.600 --> 32:22.080
And also, in addition, we will provide growth model reporting using the SBE

32:22.800 --> 32:29.280
approved methodology. While this list is not exhaustive, it provides a high-level summary

32:29.280 --> 32:33.280
of the continuity of the services for the California assessment system.

32:33.920 --> 32:40.320
And then on the next slides, I will share the expansion of services and innovations in the new

32:40.320 --> 32:50.640
contract. So the negotiated process has also produced a proposed contract that includes

32:50.640 --> 32:56.800
the needs expansion of services and innovations. For example, we're going to expand the California

32:56.800 --> 33:02.720
Spanish assessment to include speaking and extended writing. This includes the contractor

33:02.720 --> 33:09.280
scoring the extended writing. We are in the process of, we will be envisioning, developing,

33:09.280 --> 33:16.160
and providing interim assessments for the California Science Test or CAST in the LPAC.

33:17.120 --> 33:23.360
And then we are also enhancing customer care because we want to make sure that we do specific

33:23.360 --> 33:28.720
outreach to our educators and administrators and LEA coordinators to support them in their

33:28.720 --> 33:36.400
implementation of this contract and the programs. And then continuing to improve accessibility

33:37.120 --> 33:44.320
or expanding and improving accessibility and integration of assessment data into our state

33:44.320 --> 34:02.720
or CDEs and the state data systems. Sorry, furthermore, this contract includes piloting

34:02.720 --> 34:10.240
and scaling new assessment types and features. As you know, the future is, in terms of future

34:10.240 --> 34:16.480
assessment innovations, there's a lot to explore. And some of these research-based strategies are,

34:18.080 --> 34:23.440
for example, continuing implementation of the assessment innovations that we are beginning

34:23.440 --> 34:30.480
this year with our Smarter Balanced ELA and math study. And then improving,

34:33.520 --> 34:38.480
another example is improving accessibility of test questions and performance tasks.

34:39.200 --> 34:43.600
And investigating new technologies that support different ways to assess the standards.

34:45.120 --> 34:51.920
Another thing, another expansion is conducting special studies to support the validity of the

34:51.920 --> 34:59.120
assessment system. And examples of that is conducting a validation study to support

34:59.120 --> 35:06.000
reclassification using the alternate LPAC and continuing longitudinal analyses on the impact

35:06.000 --> 35:13.760
of the COVID pandemic. And also exploring the remote testing, test administration options and

35:13.760 --> 35:23.120
score comparability studies. And then furthermore, using research-based strategies to consider

35:23.120 --> 35:30.960
augmentation of our CASP and LPAC student score reports to increase parent and guardian engagement

35:30.960 --> 35:35.520
and to provide more information for them about how to support their students.

35:36.960 --> 35:45.120
And another very important negotiated component is that we will envision, develop and provide

35:45.120 --> 35:51.200
a multi-step approach to assessment innovations for embedding performance tasks in learning,

35:51.200 --> 35:57.440
for the California Science test or CASP, with input from our interest holders,

35:58.080 --> 36:04.800
our partners and approval from the State Board of Education or SBE at various and key

36:04.800 --> 36:11.840
stages of the development. So adding all this to the contract allows us to explore future

36:11.840 --> 36:18.080
assessment innovations and work with our interest holders and the SBE to conceptualize innovative

36:18.800 --> 36:21.120
strategies throughout the life of this contract.

36:21.680 --> 36:28.480
So all this work does not come at a cost, which I will cover in this slide. The budget is broken

36:28.480 --> 36:38.080
down by fiscal year here with total costs for each role in the last column. So these costs

36:38.080 --> 36:44.480
cover the five administrations that Cheryl referred to earlier, as well as the transition cost in the

36:44.640 --> 36:51.040
last year of the contract. So during the July 2021 SBE meeting, we shared the results of the Stage

36:51.040 --> 36:58.240
3 costs. ETS's cost for this task, outlined in Stage 3, is reflected in that first role.

37:02.640 --> 37:10.800
And then in Stage 4, the negotiations included the

37:11.760 --> 37:21.920
continued reporting of the lexile and quantile measures for ELA math in the second role. That

37:21.920 --> 37:26.880
component was not in the Stage 3 requirements, so it had to be negotiated in.

37:28.640 --> 37:38.240
And then furthermore, to extend the SBE's goals of evolving the assessments to the next level,

37:39.200 --> 37:44.160
the negotiations included conceptualizing assessment innovations for CAS, as I mentioned,

37:44.720 --> 37:52.160
and the cost is shown in the third role with strategic opportunities at various stages for

37:52.160 --> 38:05.600
SBE approval. And then the overall budget will be $449,870,786 in total.

38:05.600 --> 38:12.800
And at this point, I'd like to stop and see if there are any clarifying questions.

38:25.440 --> 38:29.360
Just double-checking to make sure there are not any hands up. I think you can continue.

38:29.920 --> 38:38.800
Okay, so here we are back at the CDE recommendation. Again, the California Department

38:38.800 --> 38:44.160
of Education recommends that the California State Board of Education approve the proposed

38:44.160 --> 38:49.360
contract with Educational Testing Service for the administration of the California Assessment

38:49.920 --> 38:53.520
of Student Performance and Progress and the English Language Proficiency

38:53.520 --> 38:58.240
Assessments for California, collectively known as the California Assessment System,

38:58.800 --> 39:03.200
and authorize CDE and SBE staff to make technical edits to the

39:03.200 --> 39:07.440
contract documents as needed prior to the execution of the contract.

39:11.600 --> 39:18.240
Okay. Should you need to reach our programs?

39:18.240 --> 39:29.840
For LPAC, send your questions to ELPAC at cde.ca.gov, and for CAS, send questions to

39:29.840 --> 39:38.320
caaspp at cde.ca.gov. These are program questions. And you could continue to follow us on Twitter

39:38.320 --> 39:45.760
at CDE assessments, and we are providing the assessment spotlight link for should you want

39:45.760 --> 39:59.120
to be a part of our listserv. Subscribe to caaspp at mlist.cde.ca.gov. And I'll turn this over

39:59.760 --> 40:07.040
back to you, Board President. Thank you so much for that and very informative

40:08.080 --> 40:13.920
briefing. And I'm going to call attention now to the public comment slide so that we can open

40:13.920 --> 40:19.360
the phone line for public comment queue. Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this

40:19.360 --> 40:24.400
item can do so by calling the phone number and using the access code provided on the slide that

40:24.400 --> 40:29.600
is shown now. And while we're waiting for members of the public to call in, I want to ask Member

40:29.600 --> 40:35.680
Son if she has any initial comments before I make my comments, and then I'll ask Board Members

40:35.680 --> 40:40.960
for any clarifying questions before we go to public comment, following which we'll get into

40:40.960 --> 40:49.520
discussion and a vote. Member Son. Thank you. Yeah, I want to thank the CDE staff for this,

40:50.080 --> 40:57.360
what must be, I think, a year-long process now of going through this multi-stage procurement process

40:57.920 --> 41:03.840
and gone through a lot of conversations I know and hard negotiations where we have arrived.

41:04.800 --> 41:11.440
Where I'm most excited about this is what was outlined around envisioning and developing

41:12.400 --> 41:17.840
innovative approaches to assessment. It was really important that we just don't do,

41:17.840 --> 41:23.360
that we entered into this next stage of our California assessments, not with

41:24.400 --> 41:31.280
doing the same old, that we're keeping up with research and innovations in how we assess how

41:31.360 --> 41:39.680
students are doing and beyond just kind of the same template we've been using. So I'm very

41:39.680 --> 41:45.520
excited that we have this opportunity in this next phase, in this next contract to

41:47.200 --> 41:55.200
expand how we do assessments in California. And I'll just add on that, you know, Mal and her

41:55.200 --> 42:00.800
team have done extraordinary work on this very complicated process, the very intense

42:01.840 --> 42:08.960
process as well. And we've been very pleased with the ways in which Educational Testing

42:08.960 --> 42:16.640
Service has responded with willingness to adventure with us as we may need to evolve

42:16.640 --> 42:24.720
our assessments to be as supportive as possible to teaching and learning. So we're enthusiastic

42:24.720 --> 42:30.720
about the next stages. Are there any public comments at this? Well, first, let me see if

42:30.720 --> 42:39.280
there's any clarifying questions before we go to public comment. Not seeing any. And so

42:41.120 --> 42:44.640
with that, are there any members of the public calling in?

42:45.520 --> 42:53.040
Yes, currently we have four members of the public. This is for item four,

42:53.040 --> 42:57.840
first caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

43:06.640 --> 43:10.480
Caller, we are unable to hear you. Control booth.

43:14.640 --> 43:20.480
Hello. Yes, we can can barely hear you, caller. Could you possibly turn your volume up?

43:23.040 --> 43:32.960
Hello, can you hear me? Just barely, caller. Could I get you to call back in and we will

43:32.960 --> 43:40.240
pick you up again? All right, I will do some. Thank you. Thank you. Next,

43:40.240 --> 43:44.560
caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

43:47.360 --> 43:51.600
Hello, my name is Lorraine Richards. I'm a classroom teacher representing the California

43:51.600 --> 43:56.960
Teachers Association. CTA appreciates the work of the California Department of Education and the

43:56.960 --> 44:03.600
State Board of Education in evaluating the state's assessment contract. On page 48 of attachment two,

44:03.600 --> 44:09.280
it is mentioned that the hourly rate for scores is $20 per hour for California educators

44:09.280 --> 44:15.600
and $13 per hour for other educators. Given that this is a half billion dollar contract for ETS,

44:16.240 --> 44:22.960
CTA would like to recommend that the State Board of Education request that ETS raise the hourly

44:22.960 --> 44:28.720
rate for educators so that it can be at least comparable with their contracted hourly rates.

44:29.520 --> 44:34.640
We have asked a lot for educators throughout this pandemic and it only seems fair to provide

44:34.640 --> 44:40.160
equitable compensation for this important work. Thank you very much. Thank you, caller. Next,

44:40.160 --> 44:44.560
caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

44:47.920 --> 44:52.800
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond and board. This is Liz Guillen with Public Advocates for

44:52.800 --> 44:58.640
the Equity Coalition. We're in support of this item. We really appreciate the inclusion of the

44:58.640 --> 45:04.080
upgrading of the California Spanish assessment with the addition of the speaking and extended

45:04.080 --> 45:09.600
writing components. These components will give our schools and parents a much more complete profile

45:09.600 --> 45:14.800
of a student's developing academic proficiency in Spanish and they could also serve as a tool

45:14.800 --> 45:20.560
for eligibility for pathway and seal of by literacy awards and hopefully inform our

45:20.560 --> 45:26.480
accountability system. We request that the writing component be comparable to the CASP ELA

45:26.480 --> 45:32.640
assessment in rigor and scope. We note that the development of LPAC interim assessments

45:32.640 --> 45:37.200
will be very valuable allowing schools to measure English language proficiency growth

45:37.200 --> 45:42.240
during the school year to better target instruction and identify needs for additional

45:42.240 --> 45:49.440
support. Thank you. Thank you. Next, caller, thank you so much for calling back.

45:49.440 --> 45:53.760
Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

45:53.760 --> 46:08.320
I am Marta Hernandez representing Californians Together and we are in support of CDE's recommendation

46:09.040 --> 46:14.560
to approve the proposed contract and budget with ETS for the administration of the California

46:14.560 --> 46:20.640
assessment system. We appreciate very much the upgrading of the California Spanish assessment

46:20.640 --> 46:25.600
to include speaking and extended writing components which will give our schools and parents

46:25.600 --> 46:31.120
a much more complete profile of a student's developing academic proficiency in Spanish

46:31.120 --> 46:39.200
could serve as a tool for eligibility and hopefully inform our accountability system.

46:39.200 --> 46:43.440
We are hopeful that the blueprint and design of the extended writing component will be of the same

46:43.440 --> 46:50.240
rigor and content as the ELA CASP and again I echo what others have said about the LPAC interim

46:50.240 --> 46:56.880
assessments. They will be very, very valuable to allow schools to measure growth and better

46:56.880 --> 47:02.320
target instruction and identify needs for additional support. Thank you. Thank you.

47:03.200 --> 47:08.160
Next, caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

47:10.800 --> 47:16.800
Good morning. Martha Zaragoza Diaz representing the California Association for Bilingual Education.

47:17.520 --> 47:24.400
CABE supports the approval by the board of item four. We are very pleased with the upgrading of

47:24.400 --> 47:30.320
the California Spanish assessment with the addition of the speaking and extended writing components

47:30.320 --> 47:36.880
as well as considering augmenting the CASP and LPAC student score reports to increase

47:37.600 --> 47:44.000
parent and guardian engagement. It is our hope that the writing components will be comparable

47:44.000 --> 47:50.000
to the CASP ELA assessment in rigor and scope. Thank you. Thank you.

47:52.400 --> 48:00.160
Callers, if you can turn your volume all the way up we could hear you just a little bit better.

48:00.160 --> 48:05.040
Next, caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

48:07.120 --> 48:13.440
Okay, that person just disconnected so thank you. This concludes public comment for item number four.

48:14.000 --> 48:24.240
Thank you very much. And at this point, we're open for board discussion. Board members,

48:24.240 --> 48:30.320
remember to raise your hand in the participant panel of Zoom if you have a question or comment.

48:30.320 --> 48:36.240
And Patricia Rucker, please start us off and we'll be followed by Vice President Strauss.

48:37.760 --> 48:43.120
Very much, Board President Hammond. First of all, I do want to make sure I congratulate and

48:43.120 --> 48:49.440
thank the department staff for their due diligence, but also the exhaustive process

48:49.440 --> 48:57.120
that they put in place to not only vet and review the intent of the vendors, but also to create a

48:57.120 --> 49:04.560
very transparent and public process to help us understand not only how we came to create

49:04.560 --> 49:10.320
and approve this relationship with the vendor recommended, but the rigor of the application

49:10.320 --> 49:16.080
process so that we know we can be satisfied not only with the scope of the work that will be

49:16.080 --> 49:22.160
developed, but with the opportunity to broaden the conversation about assessment. California

49:22.160 --> 49:28.960
continues to process and purchase and contract for not just paper and pencil assessment,

49:28.960 --> 49:36.320
but a system of practices for assessment and testing that opens our conversation to broader

49:36.320 --> 49:42.000
policy. And so I preface my comment, and it's more common than a question,

49:42.000 --> 49:48.880
for how this actually also, this contract also extends the scope of the charge for this board

49:48.880 --> 49:55.920
and for the department. I'd like to encourage the board and the department to revisit the language

49:55.920 --> 50:03.920
in this document to look at how we have expressed our expectations for metrics and growth targets.

50:03.920 --> 50:09.840
While the vendor can only set aspirational goals related to closing the achievement gap,

50:09.840 --> 50:16.880
it's the work of this board and this department to provide the guidance, support, and direction

50:16.880 --> 50:23.840
to districts on how they should be using these outcomes and these metrics to do that work and

50:23.840 --> 50:30.560
address planning for school achievement. For example, on page 25, under measuring and reporting,

50:31.120 --> 50:39.920
it says the results only encourage districts to set metrics that would close gaps. The current laws

50:39.920 --> 50:47.120
don't mandate this, but the intent of the LCFF should at least allow us, either on the board or

50:47.120 --> 50:55.920
the department, to at least suggest that districts should use this data to set goals and targets that

50:55.920 --> 51:01.040
would close the achievement gaps. And I know that's a fine point about, that's separate and

51:01.040 --> 51:06.240
distinct from what we're approving here, but I just think we should pay attention to the

51:06.240 --> 51:11.760
danger in compartmentalizing, approving the contract, and then the work we do on approving

51:11.760 --> 51:18.000
and developing the LCFF. They are integral and connected, and I think that the approval of this

51:18.000 --> 51:24.160
contract also has some implications for the further work we're doing on developing the LCAP.

51:24.240 --> 51:29.600
So I do want to make sure we continue that conversation and continue thinking about how

51:29.600 --> 51:36.240
we identify student subgroups and research-based standards aligned to practices that to close

51:36.240 --> 51:40.960
achievement gaps. I think it's an important conversation, and while we're charging this

51:40.960 --> 51:47.600
assessment contractor merely with the responsibility to help us explore this concept and explore

51:47.600 --> 51:53.120
these ideas and the furtherance of developing our assessment system, I think that the language in

51:53.120 --> 51:59.360
this contract has some implications for work we're already undertaking to approve and update

51:59.360 --> 52:04.000
the LCFF template and the guidance that we're currently giving districts. Thank you very much.

52:05.760 --> 52:10.880
Thank you. And Member Strauss, you're next in the queue, and then Member Escovedo.

52:11.520 --> 52:17.520
Yeah, so I want to again follow up with Member Rucker's comments and really thank the department

52:17.520 --> 52:22.960
for the thorough process and the clarity, and as you explained it today, of all the steps we went

52:22.960 --> 52:29.440
through, I actually just really want to make some comments about how pleased I am with the effort to

52:29.440 --> 52:35.680
move forward in our assessment practices so that this contract includes innovation, includes some

52:35.680 --> 52:41.600
validation studies to continue to look at our practices, some expansions of the practice of

52:41.600 --> 52:48.000
assessment, and I think what we know is it's not just the year-end time when we do our assessments,

52:48.000 --> 52:52.880
but the interim assessments that provide so much feedback and also help teachers with their

52:53.840 --> 52:59.120
matching of alignment of their classroom practices to the standards that we assess

52:59.120 --> 53:05.840
at the state level. So again, I feel that this is the next five years, it really sets an evolution

53:05.840 --> 53:11.440
and continued improvement and growth, and so I appreciate the components of the assessment

53:11.440 --> 53:16.720
contract and the practices, and I look forward to the continued improvement and implementation.

53:16.720 --> 53:22.160
Appreciate the comments of our interest holders who spoke on the phone comments today,

53:22.800 --> 53:27.600
and that we have good support for the efforts moving forward in assessment,

53:27.600 --> 53:32.960
which is obviously an important essential part of our instructional program. Thank you very much.

53:34.720 --> 53:36.160
Thank you, and Member Escobedo.

53:36.800 --> 53:42.800
Yes, I want to appreciate the amount of work and the expediency that now districts and parents are

53:42.800 --> 53:49.120
receiving this data. It's really, really critical, and I appreciate the outreach to parents, and

53:49.120 --> 53:58.160
because getting the data and then how to use the data and implementing it is just as important as

53:58.160 --> 54:05.120
the quality of the assessment. So really appreciate that outreach that you indicated to parents and

54:05.120 --> 54:12.560
and to staff as well. Just a point that hopefully as technologies and language recognition

54:12.640 --> 54:21.840
improves, you know, dual immersion is growing quickly in California, but also encompasses other

54:21.840 --> 54:28.400
languages. Spanish, as you well know, is the most predominant, but Mandarin and Tagalog are

54:28.400 --> 54:36.720
increasing. So hopefully in the future, we may be looking at assessing other languages besides

54:36.720 --> 54:44.080
Spanish as well, but really, really proud of the stance of California expanding the

54:45.280 --> 54:48.320
Spanish assessment and hopefully beyond.

54:49.920 --> 54:57.600
Terrific. I don't see any other hands up, and so at this point, I wonder if I could get a motion.

55:00.240 --> 55:03.920
I am very happy to move CDE's recommendation.

55:03.920 --> 55:06.000
And a second.

55:08.080 --> 55:14.480
I'll second. Thank you very much. We'll hold a roll call vote. Brooks, can you call the roll?

55:15.440 --> 55:16.160
Member Sun.

55:18.080 --> 55:20.080
Aye. Vice President Strauss.

55:21.120 --> 55:22.720
Yes. Member Rucker.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.440
Yes. Member Rodriguez.

55:27.280 --> 55:29.520
Yes. Member Petillo-Brownson.

55:30.480 --> 55:32.560
Yes. Member McQuillan.

55:32.560 --> 55:35.760
Yes. Member Glover-Woods.

55:38.400 --> 55:40.320
Yes. Member Escobedo.

55:41.600 --> 55:43.840
Yes. President Darlene Hammond.

55:45.040 --> 55:46.800
Yes. Member Burr.

55:47.680 --> 55:49.680
Aye. Member Bonacca.

55:51.840 --> 55:54.560
Aye. Motion passes unanimously.

55:54.560 --> 56:03.600
Terrific. Thank you, Cheryl and Mao. And we'll move on to agenda item number two.

56:04.560 --> 56:11.200
Item two is regarding the 2022-23 State Board of Education student member recommendation of

56:11.200 --> 56:15.120
finalists for submission to the governor for consideration and appointment.

56:16.000 --> 56:20.800
The State Board screening committee recommends that the State Board approve the three finalists

56:20.800 --> 56:27.280
for the position of 2022-23 SBE student member as identified in the item addendum.

56:27.920 --> 56:32.240
The approved finalist will be forwarded to the governor for his consideration and appointment

56:32.240 --> 56:38.880
as the 2022-23 State Board student member. This item will be presented by screening committee chair,

56:38.880 --> 56:41.680
Vice President Strauss. Please begin.

56:42.560 --> 56:49.840
It gives me great pleasure to present this item. This is actually one of the highlights of our

56:49.840 --> 56:57.520
state board work in November. We've worked very, very hard. We met, the screening committee met on

56:57.520 --> 57:04.720
Monday, October 18th. We reviewed 37 applications that were submitted for consideration. These

57:04.720 --> 57:11.760
students will be part of the recommendation for the board member for the next school year, the

57:11.840 --> 57:22.160
2022-23 student board member. So we selected 12 semi-finalists. So the semi-finalist then attended

57:22.160 --> 57:27.840
the 2021 Student Advisory Board on Education, better known as SBE. We're going to hear from

57:27.840 --> 57:33.920
these students in a minute. You're going to be so amazed and so hopeful for the future when you

57:33.920 --> 57:39.440
listen to what our students have to tell us about things we should be considering. The conference

57:39.440 --> 57:45.120
began on October 30th where the student delegates listened to presentations by all 12 semi-finalists

57:45.120 --> 57:50.800
and then they voted to give us six candidates. So on Monday this week, on November 1st, we

57:50.800 --> 57:58.160
interviewed the six candidates and with a huge challenge we identified three finalists. That's

57:58.160 --> 58:02.160
actually required by legislation. We actually wanted to identify more but we are required to

58:02.160 --> 58:07.920
narrow it to three. If the board approves these names will be submitted to the governor's office

58:07.920 --> 58:12.800
for review and consideration and then the governor will appoint one as the student board member for

58:12.800 --> 58:17.920
2022-23. So first on behalf of the screening committee and the state board, we wish to thank

58:17.920 --> 58:23.120
all the students who made the effort to apply and would like to encourage them to continue to offer

58:23.120 --> 58:28.640
their impressive abilities to their local, regional, and state activities. So the students who are

58:28.640 --> 58:33.920

59:27.920 --> 59:34.160
We also identified semi-finalists for the student board member for 22-23 and I want to introduce

59:34.160 --> 59:40.000
those. Dylan Choi from Chaparral High School within the Temecula Valley Unified School District

59:40.000 --> 59:45.840

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:21.760
So now this is the best part. We're going to ask each of the students and I'll call on you

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:27.680
because I can see you on the screen if that's okay and we're going to have you introduce yourself

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:32.080
and tell everybody, the audience who's watching and hopefully your families as well,

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:37.920
where you come from and actually what the board should know is many of these students serve as

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:42.800
student board members in their own school district so it is just my pleasure to introduce them and

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:48.960
I'm going to call on each student and have you unmute and introduce yourself to the public and

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:54.800
then our board president will be making a couple of comments before we go on the recommendation.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:01.600

a pleasure to be here with our incredible student leaders. My name is Esther Kim. I'm a student from

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:47.680

on education so I'm not a top 12 semifinalist this year but I was last year so it's really,

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:13.280
really amazing to see all the students here today. So I know Michelle, you're going to be

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:16.640
part of the next part of the process but would you like to introduce yourself at this time?

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:23.440
Hello everyone. My name is Michelle. I'm not sure why it says Michelle Kim Kim but my name is Michelle

go next? Yeah, of course. Hello everyone. It's such a pleasure to be here and I've learned so much from

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:48.080

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:53.440
Fremont Unified School District within Alameda County. I'm currently serving as a student board

01:03:53.440 --> 01:04:00.400
representative and it's so great to be here. So thank you. I just have to, so we're going to ask

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:06.240
the public if they wish to provide comment on the item they can do so by calling in on the telephone

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:10.720
and access code number that'll be shown on the screen in a minute. But while we're waiting for

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:17.360
that I'm going to turn it to our board members to first our president Darling Hammond and then to our

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:22.160
screening committee members who may want to make a comment about the interview and selection process.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:29.440
So member Darling Hammond, would you like to make a comment? Oh, I'm so glad to have the opportunity

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:36.320
to congratulate these students. All that you've accomplished and will accomplish, you know,

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:42.880
for your communities and for us within the state, it's an exhilarating moment. We really appreciate

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:49.840
you in both this learning process and in the work that you're doing in your schools. So

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:57.760
big congratulations. We're looking forward to hearing more from all of you. So I'm going to

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:03.520
call on our screening committee members first who participated in this amazing process. This actually

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:09.040
was a real highlight and we're going to start with our student board member Rana Banaka who

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:13.440
was incredibly helpful and valuable in this process. Rana, I'm going to turn it to you first.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:21.040
Thank you. Well, first and foremost, I think I speak for the entire screening committee when I

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:27.760
say this was an incredibly difficult decision because all of the candidates were so talented

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:33.680
and so accomplished. Personally, this was one of the hardest decisions of my life to make because

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:40.080
it was just such an amazing group of students. And I have full confidence that all of these

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:45.360
students are not only going to be the future leaders of our state but also the future leaders

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:50.000
of our nation. Once more, I want to commend all of these students for all of the hard work that

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:56.960
they put into this process. Not only did they have to give speeches and participate in interviews and

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:03.840
answer plenty of delegate questions but they also had to be a delegate at the SAVE conference and

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:09.040
they were making proposals all the while going through this really tough process. So I want to

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:15.520
commend all of these students. They're truly incredible and I have full confidence that the

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:20.960
next student board member is going to do an amazing job. So next I'm going to call on member

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:27.360
McQuillen who's the liaison to the SAVE and was part of, is going to help with the next item that

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:32.000
you're going to hear about. So I'm going to turn it to member McQuillen next. I just want to

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:38.720
congratulate all of you. It was a challenging process for both sides of the table but you were

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:45.360
all fantastic and very difficult decision to make but I just want to congratulate all of you. You

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:51.360
know, our future is in good hands with all of you as our leaders in the future. I just,

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:58.640
I learned so much throughout the day from all of you and just want to say thank you and congratulate

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:06.560
all of you. Thank you. Member Glover-Wiz, I'll turn to you next. Thank you so much. I just would like

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:13.360
to underscore what member McQuillen said. Our future is definitely in good hands. This was

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:19.840
the most phenomenal group of scholars that we had an opportunity to meet through their applications

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:27.200
and also through the interview process. We have young people who are entrepreneurs,

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:35.840
who are advocates in so many important areas for our state as well as our nation and just to again

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:41.520
echo what has already been said, it was quite the difficult process. I think if we did not have

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:46.720
that strict guidance on what we needed to do as far as selections, everyone would be selected

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:53.920
because everyone who applied as well as those who were semi-finalists and finalists just did such a

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:59.360
phenomenal job. So quite excited. Congratulations to all of you. It's so good to see those of you

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:05.360
on the screen again and looking forward to just hearing more about the wonderful things you'll be

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:11.920
doing as you move forward in your educational career and in your life. So Member Sung is the

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:17.280
other member of our screening committee so I have to ask you to make a few comments so that everyone

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:21.520
understands what an impactful experience it was to interview all these students.

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:28.400
Absolutely. As Vice President-General said, this is really the highlight of the year for me on

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:34.480
the serving on the state board is to go through and talk with these wonderful students. Look at

01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:41.600
these powerful young women. It was amazing and I think we commented over and over again that

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:51.600
these students should be 28 and 26, not 16 and 17 and 18. So you guys just were wonderful. It was

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:58.480
such a difficult decision. I think we deliberated almost longer than we had time for the interview.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:05.280
Thank you all for your participation and I just want to commend you all for

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:10.480
the application process and going through this very rigorous process.

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:16.800
Thank you. So let's put up the slide for the public comment and

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:19.920
I don't know if we have any public comments on this recommendation.

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:30.880
There are no public comments at this time so I would like a motion then to approve the state

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:36.000
board screening committee's recommendation for the finalists for the next student board member for

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:43.680
22-23. I still move. Do I have a second? I second.

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:52.160
Okay, let's see. Is either a member Escobedo? I think you got the second. I'm not sure but

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:58.400
I'll give that, we'll give it to you. So okay, so Executive Director Allen, would you take the

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:10.640
roll call vote, please? Member Sun? Aye. Vice President Strauss? Yes. Member Rucker? Yes. Member

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:21.920
Rodriguez? Yes. Member Petillo-Brownson? Yes and congrats to all of you. Member McQuillan? Yes.

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:33.680
Member Glover Woods? Yes. Member Escobedo? Yes. President Darlene Hammond? Yes. Member Burr?

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:40.320
Aye. Member Bonacca? Aye. Passes unanimously. Congratulations.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:47.840
Terrific. Thank you so much Vice President Strauss, all the members of the screening committee

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.720
and to all the students who took the time to apply and participate in this process.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.520
We're going to move on to item three and I'm going to pass the gavel to Vice President Strauss

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:07.920
for this next item. Thank you. So right now we're going to take up the item regarding the 2021

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:13.120
advisory board on education conference. This item will be presented by the student representatives

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:19.600
who participated in the 2021 student advisory board on education, the SABI annual conference.

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:26.080
This item has an addendum which is the 2021 SABI conference report. So let me just say again,

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:33.760
the students, things that students recommend to us at board meetings every November sometimes end

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:39.040
up in legislation like a student member on the instructional quality commission. The students

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:43.600
have incredible voices which you're going to hear now and at this time I'm going to ask

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:48.800
board member McQuillen and student board member Bonacca as this year's liaisons if they have any

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:54.880
comments to share given that they participated in the SABI conference earlier this week. Then after

01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:00.880
their liaisons then we'll hear the presenters. So member McQuillen I'll call on you first.

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:10.160
Right, thank you. I would really ask our board to pay attention to these students. I learned so much

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:15.600
from working with them. I got to spend the afternoon with them this week at their conference and

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:22.480
helping to listen and prep them for the presentation and give feedback on these very

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:29.680
good presentations and I learned so much and it was fantastic. It was my pleasure to be a part of

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:36.720
it. You'll notice the topics they've chosen are very near and dear to our hearts and what we've

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:43.920
been working on these past 18 months through the pandemic. Diversity, equity and inclusion,

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:52.720
post high school preparation, student wellness, civic engagement, equitable education and

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:59.440
socioeconomic support. Very important topics to us all and I just want to congratulate all the

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:07.280
students for their work and it was fantastic. So thank you. Thank you. Member Bonacca do you

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:13.920
want to make any comments before the presentations? Yeah I just want to take a second to commend all

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:20.720
of the hard work and effort put in by every single delegate, every researcher, counselor and staff

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:27.040
member that were involved in making these proposals. I was able to see it firsthand this

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:32.400
past weekend at the conference and they never failed to impress me with their passion and

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:38.640
dedication to advocacy. Let's not forget that these students spent their precious weekend,

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:44.400
their Halloween weekend at that to create these proposals and I think that says a lot about their

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:50.560
character and just how determined and dedicated they are to improving schools not only for

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:54.800
themselves and their peers but also for all of the six million students in our state.

01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:00.640
So again I just want to thank everyone involved in the SABE conference for their commitment to

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:06.960
ensuring that schools are equitable and instructional quality is ensured in our schools.

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:13.360
So at this time we have various presenters for the item. Each presenter will be introduced by

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.720
Stephanie Hu. We met Stephanie. She's the educational policy director of the California

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:24.800
Association of Student Councils, CASC and we'll have a brief introduction by Michelle Kim,

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:28.960
this year's state president of CASC. So I'm going to turn it over to Michelle and Stephanie

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:34.960
and would ask you to please begin. Thank you. Thank you so much. So good morning. My name is

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:40.480
Michelle Kim and I serve as the state president for the California Association of Student Councils

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:45.680
and I'm a senior at Portola High from the Irvine Unified School District. Two Superintendent Tony

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:50.880
Thurmond, President Darling Hammond, Vice President Strauss and esteemed members of the board,

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:55.440
I am honored and elated to introduce CASC proposals today with the support of our

01:14:55.440 --> 01:15:01.520
incredible delegates and Director Stephanie Hu. I'm sure CASC already holds a dear place in all

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:06.800
of our hearts but as a refresher CASC has had the privilege to present proposals to the board since

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:13.120
1963 and has been instilling leadership and advocacy values in students since its establishment

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:18.640
in 1947 by the California Department of Education and the Association of California School

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:24.880
Administrators. As the primary beneficiaries of the education system and as youth in a generation

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:30.080
whose motivation for the improvement and advancement of public education seems to never end,

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:34.480
the students of CASC would like to extend our warmest gratitude to the board for continuing

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:40.000
to champion student voice through the Student Advisory Board on Education. We would especially

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.560
like to extend our thanks for keeping student perspective and wellness at the front of difficult

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:50.240
decisions especially after the pandemic's impact on our communities. Actions such as expanding

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:54.960
flexibility with school districts by continuing to use the shortened CASC test blueprints and

01:15:54.960 --> 01:16:00.720
developing the ethnic studies model curriculum shows students and CASC delegates that the board

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:04.640
and Department of Education continues to prioritize youth before everything else.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.880
This conference is significant for various reasons but I'd like to commend 12 exceptional

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:15.680
students who have served both CASC and their respective communities this weekend. To the

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:21.280
student board member semi-finalists, thank you for your contributions to our education system

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:26.000
and to our current student board member Rana Bananta, thank you for facilitating and mentoring

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:31.840
each of our semi-finalists as they progress through the SPM process. Before I pass the

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:37.120
virtual stage onto Stephanie, I'd like to take some time to recognize our amazing panelists

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:42.480
member Jim McKillen, Dennis Myers, Jonathan Peterson, and Sean Tenenbaum, as well as our

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:48.160
experienced consultants Margaret Ruiz and Hilva Chan. Finally, I'd like to send another thanks

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:53.600
to our extraordinary CASC State Council for all the hard work we've put in behind the scenes

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:59.920
and now Stephanie and our speakers. Thank you so much for that introduction, Michelle. Good

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:04.720
morning and thank you to the esteemed members of the board for allowing this amazing opportunity

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:10.240
once again. My name is Stephanie Hu and I am a senior at Tesora High School in the Capistrano

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:16.000
Unified School District, the education policy for the California Association of Student Councils,

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:23.440
the director of the Student Advisory Board on Education Conference 2021, or SAIP. Since 1963,

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:28.800
students from all of California have critiqued, assessed, and evaluate the state of their public

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:34.000
education and school systems at SAIP. During a normal year, we would all be in Sacramento

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:39.680
right now and the delegation of students would be sitting behind me, filling every available seat

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:46.320
and dress in their business professional attire. But today is different. Today, I sit before you

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:51.280
in front of a computer screen. As with the majority of everyday tasks and events, the

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:57.040
COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to adapt. This year's conference, too, took place virtually,

01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:02.320
with each student connecting from their own home. It has been an absolute honor witnessing the

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:07.520
growth of our 60 delegates over the past three days. Their passion for their education, their

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:12.960
willingness to be flexible, and their desire to actively work for change are so evident,

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:18.960
even from a computer screen. As many students begin their transition from distance learning

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:23.600
to in-person learning, we are increasingly reminded of the critical perspectives of the

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:30.240
student voice. With COVID-19 and this transition amplifying the faults in our education system,

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:34.400
student feedback within education has never before been of greater consequence.

01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:40.720
Because we are the ones who experience a California education system, the ones undergoing this

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:45.200
transition in learning, and the ones who wake up early in the morning to attend school,

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:49.840
every single proposal presented today was created entirely by students.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:55.520
With this in mind, this year's delegates have had complete control of the topics presented to you.

01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:02.000
Delegates debated, voted, and decided on six topics that truly embody what the delegation

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:08.320
views to be areas of concern in the California education system. These include diversity,

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:14.160
equity, and inclusion, post-high school preparedness, student wellness, civic engagement,

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:20.080
equitable education, and last but not least, socioeconomic support. Over the course of three

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:25.120
days, they took it upon themselves to compress all of our different perspectives, ideas, passions,

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:31.280
wants, and needs into six thorough proposals. I am confident that as the Student Advisory Board

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:37.280
on Education presents a proposal to combat the issues within and concerning our education system,

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:41.200
the members of the State Board of Education will be hearing the most pressing concerns

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:46.800
of the best student representatives of California. Our first presentation will be on the topic of

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:51.360
diversity, equity, and inclusion presented by Kavya Suresh. Thank you.

01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:00.080
Good morning Superintendent Thurmond, Board President Darling-Hammond,

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:05.280
Vice President Strauss, and esteemed board members. My name is Kavya Suresh and I am a

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:09.520
sophomore attending San Marcos Senior High School in the Santa Barbara Unified School District.

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:15.760
On behalf of the Student Advisory Board on Education, the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:19.920
Group recommends that the State Board of Education collaborates with the California

01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:25.520
Department of Education to create and recommend a framework for diversity, equity, and inclusion

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:30.240
professional development training for all employees of the California education system.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:36.240
My first experience discussing my identity was in my English ethnic studies class in ninth grade.

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:42.240
Until that class, I had no idea how to describe my experience in the California education system.

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:47.920
I didn't know what to call it when teachers would pause before reading my name out loud and announce

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:55.520
it's too complicated so who is K-A-V-Y-A in front of the whole entire class. At the age of five,

01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:00.800
being told I don't really belong here and my English will never be good enough by my teachers

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:05.680
and other school staff damaged my self-esteem and enabled my peers to be racist and xenophobic

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:10.880
without consequences. Though my ethnic studies class is one of the most valuable classes I've

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:15.600
ever taken, it could not reverse the years I had spent questioning the validity of my identity.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:20.640
But we cannot continue waiting until students reach high school to teach them that their

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:25.280
intersectional identities are valid and beautiful. The important conversation about

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:31.600
anti-discrimination must start earlier. While there has been significant process in diversity,

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:37.280
equity, and inclusion, such as the passing of AB 101 regarding ethnic studies, these actions

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:42.400
are primarily relevant to high school students, meaning that the 68% of the California students

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:46.720
in elementary and middle schools remain without any instruction on important topics of identity.

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:52.560
A 2016 Stanford study found that a one-time intervention to help teachers and students

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:57.280
empathize with each other halved the number of suspensions at five diverse California middle

01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:01.840
schools, and it significantly helped students who had previously been suspended to feel more

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:07.200
connected at their school. It's critical that we provide these necessary tools for all educators

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:12.320
to practice anti-discrimination, especially in early education, to promote empathetic educator

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:17.920
student relationships. Therefore, the Student Advisory Board on Education advises that the

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:22.640
State Board of Education work alongside the California Department of Education to create a

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:29.600
framework for DEI-centered professional development training for all California K-12 faculty,

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:34.960
staff, and board members. This comprehensive framework will further be made available to

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:39.600
all local education sites to be adapted on a district level and complement measures the

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:45.040
state has already taken, encompassing important topics such as racism, sexism, transphobia,

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:51.040
ableism, and religious discrimination. To ensure the impacts of all school faculty and staff

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:55.920
contribute to a positive school environment, we must provide educators the necessary training

01:22:55.920 --> 01:23:01.200
to handle critical student issues surrounding DEI in California schools. Introducing topics

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:05.600
like identity to students from elementary school will help them build a better relationship with

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:11.680
their peers, trusted adults, and themselves. By encouraging educators to reimagine their

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:16.640
instructional practices and actively combat discrimination, we can empower marginalized

01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:22.080
students to be advocates for their own education. As we continue to make revolutionary change in

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:27.440
our education system in resistance to oppression, we must train educators to properly facilitate

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:32.480
conversations surrounding identity starting in primary education. Through our solution,

01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:37.600
I hope that stories like mine do not need to be repeated. I hope that every child gets their

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:41.920
preferred name read aloud correctly, that every child is able to proudly speak their native

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:46.400
language, and that every child develops a strong connection with their identity from an early age.

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:51.840
It is our greatest hope that you consider this proposal an opportunity to promote the development

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:56.720
of a more inclusive education system for the students of today and leaders of tomorrow.

01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:00.400
Thank you for your time and consideration, and we welcome any feedback.

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:13.680
So I think what we're going to do is take a comment because we have six different topics. So

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:17.680
on this topic of diversity, equity, and inclusion, do we have any board

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:23.680
comments or questions before we go to the next one? And I'll start with Board Member Bonacca.

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:30.960
Well, first and foremost, I just want to thank you for creating this comprehensive proposal and

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:36.000
for all the work that you and your team put in throughout SAVE to create it. I really love the

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.240
fact that you're focusing on this issue through the lens of professional development for school

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:45.440
staff because they have such a significant role on setting the tone in the classroom and really

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:51.360
ensuring that all students feel included. I can personally still remember the days in elementary

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:57.680
school when my peers would call me a terrorist and what they saw as jokes. And I remember when

01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:02.000
I reported this to my teacher, the best case scenario was that she would give them a light

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.640
warning and the worst case was she told me that they were just kidding and that I shouldn't take

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:12.480
it too seriously. But I remember that in neither scenario did she explain to them what they said

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:18.560
was wrong. And the more I've talked to students of color and marginalized groups, the more I realize

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:24.960
that this is essentially a universal experience that so many students have and it's truly unfortunate

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:31.680
to see. And that's why I think it's so important to approach this through the lens of professional

01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:37.920
development because it's utterly important to see that all school staff are trained on how to

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:43.920
foster diversity and inclusion in our classrooms. And I can just say this from the perspective of

01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:49.040
our district. We recently had a presentation from a researcher who's been studying our district.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:55.200
His name is Dr. Aquanafua and he actually did something very similar. He researched the effects

01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:00.000
of a teacher professional development training program which aimed to promote equity in schools

01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:05.920
and every single outcome was improved after this program. So I know this is just one district but

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:10.160
it definitely gives me hope for this proposal. Again, thank you so much for all the hard work

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:17.520
that you put into it. Thank you board member Menaka. Member Glover-Woods. Thank you. I'd like

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:25.840
to also just thank everyone who worked so diligently on this proposal. It is such a critical one. As we

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:33.200
think about our steps in California into a society where everyone's lived experiences are

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:40.240
not only recognized but respected and valued where everyone in the diversity and identities of

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:47.360
all those who make up our great state again are respected and valued. A critical aspect of that

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:54.080
is in providing all of the educators and all of those who touch students with the professional

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:59.840
development and training and understanding respecting and valuing the lived experiences of

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:06.240
all who live in our state. So I just again thank all of you for this very timely proposal. It

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:14.240
definitely is a next step in our work to move forward so that no one has to experience some of

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:20.320
the experiences that many of you shared just a while ago. Thank you so much for this.

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:28.320
Thank you member Glover-Woods. Member Rucker. Thank you very much. I'm so pleased to be able to

01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:36.480
meet all the students on this panel. As you pointed out last year we were not able to meet

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:42.720
in a face-to-face meeting. We were virtual and the same is true this year. If we were in the room

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:48.000
together I would have asked all of you to stand so that you could be recognized. I do appreciate

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:53.600
that we get a chance to see all of you and I also want to congratulate you for taking on and

01:27:53.600 --> 01:28:00.320
choosing to tackle a very tough topic because this has very deep personal meaning for so many

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:07.440
students and your recommendation is coming at a time where legislators and school leaders

01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:13.200
and other states are making connections about issues of diversity to conversations about

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:19.760
critical race theory or even seeing legislators outlawing the use of words like diversity

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:26.160
in education conversations at schools. So for you all to take this step and to be out front and so

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:32.240
forward thinking in your proposal is very important particularly at this time and I really do want to

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:38.480
congratulate you not only for the innovation but for the bravery that is required to be willing to

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:45.040
have this conversation and to be willing to be the face of that conversation. I personally in my

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:51.280
own work as a student as a teacher and then sitting on this panel there's always the means

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:57.440
about African-American women as angry black women that any woman who chooses to be assertive there

01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:02.720
must be something wrong with you. For you all to take this step and to make these assertions

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:07.680
not only so intelligently but with such sophistication is not only a hallmark of

01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:16.080
what your leadership skills are but also a fantastic note and representation not only

01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:21.200
for the young women that you are representing on this panel but for all of the students whether

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:27.280
they are students who are students of color or not who could benefit from the work and the

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:33.520
initiative that you're recommending. So thank you so very much for this conversation and Kavya

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:39.680
I just want to tell you you did a fantastic job thank you very much. So thank you member

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:48.000
Rucker member Rodriguez. Yes hello I want to thank you for such an eloquent presentation

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:56.560
and I think that your beautiful words encapsulated so much pain students go

01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:00.480
through when they don't feel like they're included in school. Myself included I got a

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:07.840
little teary as I was listening to your story and touching and this is very powerful and necessary

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:12.880
work because we want to make sure that all of our students feel like they belong that they're

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:22.640
included and that their sensitivity and receptivity reception with the adult in the room right that is

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:32.000
managing the the inclusion and for you to to bring out the statement is so important and so timely so

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:39.440
I last last year I geeked out a little too much listening to you all so I'm gonna I'm gonna tone

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:47.680
back a little bit but thank you. So just so you know we are really we have five more items that

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:54.320
are going to be equally as engaging and for those of you in the meeting just so you know we had the

01:30:54.320 --> 01:31:01.040
a denim is attached to the item with the full report with all the specifics. I know our students

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:07.120
are so articulate but they also wrote that well as it's also effectively written as well so it's a

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:12.240
document I think all of us can look forward to to referring to and using going forward so at this

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:18.080
time we're going to hear topic two post high school preparedness presented by Mina Li.

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:26.240
Good morning esteemed board members my name is Mina Li and I am a senior attending John Marshall

01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:31.520
Senior High School in Los Angeles Unified School District. I am here to speak on behalf of the

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:36.960
students of California who struggle with the lack of post high school preparedness. The Student

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:42.400
Advisory Board on Education has identified that students do not have easy access to the counselor

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:48.800
resources their school offers. We propose that on-site high school counselors are equipped with a

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:53.520
digital post high school readiness handbook approved by the California State Board of Education.

01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:59.440
Each year hundreds of thousands of California students like myself are faced with the

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:04.400
predicament of what to do after high school. Notably most students are not aware of the many

01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:09.520
routes they can take after high school. There seems to be only two clear options go to college

01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:15.280
or don't go to college. While schools do provide counselors to help students there are often not

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:20.400
enough counselors to support everyone. Thus most are not properly counseled on deciding what they

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:25.440
will do after high school. For example at Bettman High School of Tustin Unified School District in

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:31.040
Irvine many students are unaware of the on-campus college and career resources. At Santiago High

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:35.680
School of Corona Norco Unified School District students are frustrated that counselors are not

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:40.080
able to provide the necessary resources and guidance for college application process.

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:45.840
Not only that at my school of John Marshall High School in Los Angeles Unified School District

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:49.840
career pathways are not widely promoted to students leaving those who are interested in

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:55.600
certain work fields with no support or resources provided by the school. Many of my friends are

01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:00.880
interested in a career pathway post-graduation but could not find the resources being promoted

01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:06.640
on campus which left them with no adult guidance at the beginning of the school year. Thankfully

01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:11.600
our advisor teacher has been aiding them through the process. This shouldn't be happening. My

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:17.120
friends just like any other students in California deserve to have an adult support regardless what

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:22.560
path they choose to take. Counselors possessing and providing these resources and information

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:28.000
is vital for students. While counselors have access to resources this information is not enough

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.600
to help all students. For example there's little material surrounding topics such as interviewing,

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:38.160
resume building, and job training leaving students with no proper support or education.

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:44.240
These issues can further divide the racial and socioeconomic gaps within the school system.

01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:48.400
For example students of higher income are able to afford private college preparatory classes

01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:53.440
and counselors. However those who cannot afford these luxuries like myself and my peers are left

01:33:53.440 --> 01:34:00.160
to fend for ourselves. To address these critical problems we strongly recommend that the California

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:05.120
State Board of Education to administer the creation of a digital handbook via the California

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:09.600
Department of Education. One that focuses on counselors rather than student conduct.

01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:14.480
This digital handbook created by the California Department of Education shall not only be

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:18.960
distributed and directly introduced to counselors as part of their training

01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:22.720
but shall also be accessible on the SBE website for the public to view.

01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:27.520
Local school district boards will also be encouraged to utilize this resource via email

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:32.320
and other means of outreach. Topics in the handbook will include but are not limited to

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:36.400
guidelines for counselors on detailed office hours and school-wide meetings that counselors

01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:40.320
can set up to ultimately help students make a rational and well-educated decision.

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:46.960
Educational partners such as students, counselors, administrators, and CTE industry workers will

01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:52.000
contribute to the development of the handbook to ensure that it contains relevant and well-rounded

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:57.440
information on how counselors can guide their students. Every high school counselor in California

01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:01.680
should be strongly recommended by the state and local board alike to use this resource to help

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:07.520
students in choosing a post-secondary school path that will set them up for success. The implementation

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:12.000
of the digital handbook is critical as existing counseling practices regarding post-secondary

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.040
education is less than adequate. On average, California schools hold a student to counselor

01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:23.680
ratio of more than 600 to 1 respectively while the American Counselors Association recommends

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:29.760
a ratio of 250 to 1. The limited one-to-one interaction between students and counselors

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:35.840
is apparent and thus counselors must have reliable easy to access resources at their disposal.

01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:43.040
We urge the state board to adopt this proposal. Counselors must know how to properly support and

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:47.760
communicate the resources available to students as they discern their post-high school path in

01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:54.480
order for our students, for my peers, for myself to be well prepared. With this digital handbook,

01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:58.640
students will not only feel empowered to make educated decisions about their future,

01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:03.680
but will also be motivated to educate themselves with the different paths that await them post

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:07.120
graduation. Thank you for your time and consideration.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:16.560
Mina, thank you so much. I will open it up for board comments starting with our student

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:24.000
board member, Manaka. Go ahead, please. Again, I want to thank you for this well

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:29.440
researched proposal. I really love the fact that you focus on the population of students who

01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:35.040
aren't planning on attending college, because what I've observed as a student is that we place

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:43.920
such an emphasis on college, college, college students who aren't planning to go to college.

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:50.000
That's simply not just a bad thing that they're not going to college. I think it's somewhat

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.560
villainized in some students' eyes. If students want to go into a career that doesn't involve

01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:59.120
college, then there's no need and they need to be educated about the alternate pathways.

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:04.800
For those students who aren't planning to attend college, they really don't need those counselors

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:10.160
telling them how to get into college. They really do need counselors who can help them navigate

01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:16.080
post high school life and inform them about all the different steps that they can take to pursue

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:22.240
their ideal careers. I just want to underscore the fact that the pitfall of not emphasizing this

01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:29.680
education enough is that the students who do plan to choose an alternate pathway that isn't

01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:37.280
college don't have enough information to make well informed and good decisions moving forward.

01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:42.320
They might end up with neither a college degree nor a career, which is not a great situation to

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:47.040
be in. I think this is a really great way of supporting those students who choose to pursue

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:52.160
these alternate pathways. Again, I want to thank everyone involved in creating this proposal.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.200
Thank you. Member McQuillan.

01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:05.680
Great presentation, Mina. Great job. I just think this topic is so important. Speaking as a

01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:12.480
PPS credentialed person, my training was many years ago, well over 20 years ago.

01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:19.520
A digitized handbook to standardize some of the model practices would be fantastic for

01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:26.320
California schools. Great recommendation. Thank you for presenting this. Thank you very much.

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:33.120
Okay. I'm going to see if we have any other board comments. Again, we have

01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:39.680
four more, so stay tuned. Here's our next one. We're going to hear about student wellness,

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:49.760
and that's going to be presented by Alicia del Toro. COVID-19 has been a time of loss

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:56.160
for all of us. Many of us as students have had to navigate our education while facing traumatizing

01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:01.440
personal hardships. I think this is best demonstrated by the experiences of my good friend

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:06.400
whose father is a doctor. There have been periods in the past year where you could not see him for

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:12.640
weeks at a time. Worrying about his father's safety, his own academics, and an unsure future

01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:18.560
understandably pushed him into a terrible mental state. Although coming back to campus had its own

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:24.880
struggles, he was finally able to return to a safe place, the wellness center. It was so important

01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:30.480
for him to have someone to listen to his story and provide support. I can say with confidence

01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:34.400
that a wellness center saved his life and the lives of many others.

01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:41.120
Good morning, esteemed board members. My name is Alicia del Toro, and I am a sophomore at St.

01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:56.080
Francis High School. We recognize that the state has already made efforts to strengthen the mental

01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:03.680
well-being of students, as well as the implementation of various task forces. However,

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:08.640
in my experience, mental health has still deteriorated within my high school as well

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:15.040
as many others across California as we return to in-person education. Recent statistics show

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:21.120
that 32% of students who were not receiving mental health support feel that they are now needed,

01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:28.000
and over half of California students need mental health support. In addition, 23% of students have

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.880
rated their mental wellness at a three or less on a scale of one to ten post-pandemic, which

01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:38.240
requires immediate attention. Upon further investigation into the wellness of the student

01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:43.920
body across the state, the most recurring vocabulary used to describe one's mental state

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:49.520
were words such as lonely, overwhelming, and anxious. In my own friend group, I've heard jokes

01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:53.840
about serious mental health consequences, including suicide, on a frequent basis.

01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:59.760
As a student in the current education system, it is heartbreaking to see my peers share these

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:06.000
feelings. As opposed to the current state we are in, K-12 schools should strive to foster an

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.880
environment that destigmatizes mental health, while providing students with access to resources

01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:16.160
and facilities that support their well-being. The overall wellness of students should rise

01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:20.800
by addressing issues present in both school and home environments, while actively encouraging open

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:26.720
communication and trust between teachers, parents, and students. Students should be able to feel that

01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:32.160
their well-being is prioritized in the education system. My counselor group and I dove into the

01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:38.400
question of, why is this not the case? We concluded that this is due to a lack of prioritization of

01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:42.640
mental health in schools, which has led to a lack of awareness within parents, students,

01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:49.440
and administrators. As a result, seeking help for mental health is stigmatized in schools all over

01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:54.720
California, where many students think they can only receive help for severe mental health illnesses.

01:41:55.600 --> 01:42:00.800
Thus, in direct relation to the issue at hand, the Student Advisory Board on Education strongly

01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:05.840
recommends that districts implement and customize a blueprint for wellness centers that provide

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:11.200
professional help, education, and overall support for student mental health. We recommend that

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:15.600
schools utilize pre-existing resources and blueprints from the Community Preventative

01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:20.640
Services Task Force, California School-Based Health Alliance, etc., that will outline the basic

01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:26.000
functions and organization of a wellness center, including lounge areas or rooms for relaxation,

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.160
readily available counselors, snacks, medical supplies, and music functions.

01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:35.840
The center itself will vary based on different districts, but the goal is to provide an area

01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:41.840
of safety and comfort for all students. Although student well-being will never be in a perfect

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:46.640
state, wellness centers take a step in the right direction by helping students across California

01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:52.160
reach a healthy state of mind. By establishing wellness centers, we are setting up a tangible

01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:56.880
pillar of support for all students, ensuring that no student feels alone in their struggles.

01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:02.640
In my high school, the wellness center is a popular hub that many students turn to when

01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:07.360
feeling stressed or need advice from a mental health professional. There have been multiple

01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:11.680
cases where a friend was having a mental health crisis, but they were able to visit the wellness

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:17.360
center, collect themselves, and return to class. Had the center not been an option, they would have

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:24.080
had to leave school and miss out on their education. Due to the long-term implications of the pandemic

01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:30.000
on mental health, it is a necessity, not a luxury, for schools to provide student wellness centers

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:36.000
as a designated safe space students can turn to and receive adequate support, ultimately allowing

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.480
for students to reach their maximum potential. Thank you for your time. I will now open the

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:48.080
floor to any feedback. Thank you so much, Alicia. I'm going to turn the comments over first to

01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:56.640
member Escobedo for his comments. I just want to say how I applaud you, Alicia. The mental health

01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:03.360
not only is the stigma, but also the access to services. Our board will be looking at this

01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:11.760
community school concept, and hopefully this could really push forward the whole aspect of

01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:22.640
minimizing the stigma and having immediate access for students and adults who are suffering from

01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:28.880
mental health issues. Thank you for bringing this to the forefront. Thank you, member Escobedo.

01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:36.160
Member McQuillen. Good job, Alicia. I really appreciated your presentation. Fantastic.

01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:42.960
For bringing this topic to our attention, we know some schools have wellness centers, others are

01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:49.280
just starting out, and some have not even begun to do it. Thank you for bringing this important

01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:56.800
topic to our attention. The wellness of our students coming out of the pandemic is so important

01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:02.240
in order to get to the reading, writing, and arithmetic. We know mental health is so important,

01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:09.440
so thank you and great presentation. I'm going to turn it over, and I apologize to Stephanie

01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:14.400
Hu and Michelle Kim, who are our liaisons, to introduce the next one. I apologize.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.160
Our next presenter will be Jennifer Tran on civic engagement.

01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:33.760
Good morning, President Darling-Hampton and esteemed board members. My name is Jennifer Tran.

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:38.720
I'm a senior at Bolsa Grande High School in the Garden Grove Unified School District.

01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:43.520
I'm here to present to you the student advisory board's education civic engagement proposal.

01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:49.600
I am not speaking to you today as just another student, but as a first-generation student,

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:55.600
as a minority student, and as a student living below the California poverty level. Statistically,

01:45:55.600 --> 01:46:00.800
immigrants, lower socioeconomic status, and minority children are considerably less likely

01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:05.760
to grow up into informed and engaged citizens. Historically, these groups have significantly

01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:10.640
lower voter turnout and community participation rates as adults. These differences can be

01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:15.600
drastic, with voter turnout rates for higher-income citizens almost doubling that of lower-income

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:20.720
citizens. All the odds, all the statistics say that I shouldn't be here right now,

01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:27.920
in front of you, civically engaged, and trying to better our education system. But I am. How is this

01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:33.520
possible? It's because I was able to find the necessary resources through networking, friends,

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:39.120
and honestly mindless internet scrolling to find my voice in the system early on. My civic

01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:45.760
participation today will undoubtedly translate to a bright future of civic engagement. A 2019 study

01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:51.600
by the University of California Los Angeles shows that student civic engagement breeds citizen

01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:57.680
civic engagement. By encouraging students to be aware, knowledgeable, and especially engaged in

01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:03.120
systems of power as young adults, we can almost completely eliminate the disparity in participation

01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:07.840
of marginalized groups. In the past, through programs such as the Seal of Civic Engagement

01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:12.560
and the Civic Learning Award, the State Board has recognized civic engagement as an important

01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:19.040
factor of a quality education. But many of these programs are just simply not accessible to all

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:24.160
students. We must acknowledge the ever-growing achievement gap when it comes to opportunities

01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:29.680
in or even knowledge about civic engagement. In many of these marginalized groups, there's a

01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:35.520
misunderstanding of what civic engagement is and what it pertains to. Being a district student

01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:40.640
board member myself and consistently engaging in systems of power around me, I realized that

01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:46.080
civic engagement can be something as simple as working on a student advisory board or being in

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:52.160
a voter registration drive. However, some students may unintentionally politicize civic engagement,

01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:58.320
causing them and others to stray away from it due to the stigmatization. That is why we need to reach

01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:04.560
into these groups, redefine civic engagement as an everyday action, and redefine the student role

01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:10.640
not as subjects but as collaborators and stakeholders within our own education. We, the

01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:15.680
Student Advisory Board on Education, recommend that the State Board of Education implement an

01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:21.600
additional seventh goal regarding civic engagement within the equity section of the Quality Schooling

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:27.920
Framework. We recommend this seventh goal read. Goal seven, quality schools will provide equitable

01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:32.960
access to civic engagement opportunities and applicable civic education to all students.

01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:38.480
High quality schools recognize the need for equitable access to civic engagement opportunities

01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:44.000
and applicable civic education, understanding that is a key aspect of people education and

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:50.080
post-high school civic preparedness. In fulfilling this goal, LEAs ensure that students have accessible

01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:55.600
avenues to participate in civic engagement, including but not limited to school site councils,

01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:01.120
voter registration, district board meetings, and advocacy training. Reward students who demonstrate

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:06.480
excellence in civics education and participation and understanding of the United States Constitution,

01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:11.600
the California Constitution, and the democratic system of government and equip students for a

01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:18.880
lifetime of civic engagement. We hope the solution can act as a stepping stone, creating a ripple

01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:23.760
effect for the statewide recognition of civic engagement as it sets a concrete goal for districts

01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:28.640
regarding civic engagement, encouraging LEAs to promote and record present levels of student

01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:34.960
involvement. Despite its simplicity, its fundamentality is ever-present. Civic engagement

01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:40.080
must become a priority and a goal for districts. I know from firsthand experience that civic

01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:45.680
engagement not only encourages academic success and extracurricular involvement, but also prepares

01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:51.520
students to be lifelong active and informed constituents. This is especially important for

01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:56.240
lower socioeconomic status students, such as myself, who may struggle with school because of

01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:01.760
that lack of connection to their community. This additional goal in the quality schooling framework

01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:07.200
reaches out to schools, reaches out to districts, and really portrays and emphasizes the importance

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:12.960
of civic engagement within a quality education, laying out the base for a future of total immersed

01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:18.400
student civic engagement. We must remember that we are not just teaching the students of today,

01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:23.920
but raising the citizens, the voters, and the constituents of tomorrow, and thus must make their

01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:30.080
participation and knowledge of the system they live ever so presently in a priority and an aspect

01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:37.600
of a true quality education. Thank you. Thank you, Jennifer. So we'll turn to board member

01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:46.480
comments. So we'll start with member Bonica. Well, first I want to thank you and your team

01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:52.320
for creating this detailed proposal. Just in terms of the technical parts, I really love how

01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:58.880
you approach the implementation of civic education and civic engagement through adding a goal in the

01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:03.280
quality schooling framework. I think that's quite a unique way of approaching it, and I also love

01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:08.800
that you give a lot of flexibility to LEAs to determine how they want to implement it in the

01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:15.120
way that they see best fit. But just in general, I think civic education and civic engagement

01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:21.920
is so important to students and the wider community because it not only informs decision makers and

01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:28.240
policy makers on student perspectives, but I think it also really empowers students to stand up for

01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:33.360
themselves and others, and that's not just in, you know, politics and policy, but just in every

01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:38.320
other aspect of their life. Really, it teaches them how to stand up for what they believe in,

01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:43.920
and I think it just gives them confidence in themselves and in the systems that are affecting

01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:47.280
them. So again, I want to thank you for this proposal. I think it's really great.

01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:50.960
Ronna, thank you so much. Member Escobedo, you have your hand up?

01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:59.200
Sorry, I forgot to take mine down last time.

01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:06.560
Okay. Okay. Do we have any other board member comments on civic engagement? Member McQuillin.

01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:13.920
Great job, Jennifer. I appreciated this presentation so much. You know, it's made

01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:18.720
me think about all the different ways that different groups can be civically involved,

01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:24.400
you know, and for tribal members throughout California, it's very different to be involved

01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:29.840
in your tribal government or your ceremonies and giving back that way to the community and

01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:36.720
being involved that way. So I really appreciate this presentation. Thank you. Thank you, Member

01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:42.720
McQuillin. So seeing no more hands, I'm going to turn it back to Stephanie and Michelle for the

01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:50.000
introduction for the next item. Next presenter will be Lynda Nong on equitable education.

01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:58.800
Good morning, esteemed members of California Board of Education. I'm going to be quite open here.

01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:04.000
I'm a person that zones out a lot. I found myself zoning out during the lecture in my AP United

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:09.600
States history class, and when I eventually returned to Earth, I realized that I have just

01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:13.920
missed an important topic and I'm forced to rely on my peers to catch me up to speed.

01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:19.360
It is not that I don't care about school. I love being able to learn alongside my peers,

01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:23.760
but when the information being taught does not connect to me or allows for engagement,

01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:29.520
it is hard for me and so many other students to stay focused. My name is Lynda Nong and I'm a

01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:34.080
junior at Portola High School in the Irvine Unified School District in Orange County.

01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:38.800
I am honored to be representing the California Association of Student Councils and promote

01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:44.720
equitable education within California. It is apparent now more than ever that not all students

01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:50.640
in California are receiving an equitable quality of education. Many students are disengaged with

01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:55.840
their curriculum since it often does not connect to them personally or it does not feed their

01:53:55.840 --> 01:54:00.960
learning needs. For example, at Portola High School, there is very little required reading

01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:05.760
written by authors of colors in the English curriculum. Additionally, some students struggle

01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:11.360
to sit through hours of lectures because they experience ADHD symptoms that go ill-advised and

01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:17.360
unaddressed. In these cases, students' learning needs are often voiced but not properly acted upon

01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:22.720
by school's faculty. Additionally, many schools have poor communication between students and

01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:28.480
counselors, making the course selection process very inconvenient. This situation leads to a

01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:34.160
general dissatisfaction among students regarding their academic future. We also notice the trends

01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:38.560
of students being uncomfortable with taking surveys that ask for student feedback because

01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:43.280
their personal information is collected or that they're not aware that the results are anonymous

01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:49.440
and this deters the students from providing their honest opinions. In light of these concerns,

01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:53.840
we recommend that the California Department of Education provide a blueprint called Race in

01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:58.720
School Equity or RISE for short, which function as a general guideline that champions a more

01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:04.960
equitable education in the California schooling system. Considering that there is no one-size-fits-all

01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:09.680
solutions, local school districts are given the ability to implement RISE as they see fit.

01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:14.080
Once approved, the RISE blueprint will be shared with all California school districts

01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:18.800
through usual distribution methods, providing them with resources to improve their existing systems.

01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:24.800
A core part of our vision for RISE is outlining tangible and feasible practices that can be easily

01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:29.280
integrated with existing curriculums. The California Department of Education will take

01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:34.720
into account of the voices and opinions of students, teachers, administrators, and parents

01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:40.160
from various cultures, races, genders, language abilities, disabilities, socioeconomic statuses,

01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:44.960
and academic proficiencies to create this blueprint. This blueprint recommends professional

01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:49.200
development courses for teachers that allow students to choose multiple forms of learning

01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:53.920
and promote more frequent and accessible means of communication with faculty and students,

01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:58.800
catering to our students' preferences. For example, allowing anonymous forms of communication

01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:04.000
between students and administrators will allow for more honest feedback. Additionally, this blueprint

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:08.480
will peel red districts with survey templates that gather data and voices from the students.

01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:13.760
By accommodating the learning needs of all student groups, these students will have a chance

01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:18.400
to receive information more equitably and comprehensively. This will translate into an

01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:23.200
increased student motivation to engage with the school curriculum, making the overall learning

01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:28.080
environment more inclusive and effective. By improving communication, schools will better

01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:33.680
understand student needs and opinions, which will ultimately enhance productivity. We believe that

01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:38.560
all students deserve equitable educational opportunities holistically by having a class

01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:44.000
and setting curriculum that best suits them. Students should feel and be supported by the

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.960
school staff through the use of diverse teaching methods and efficient methods of communication.

01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:54.000
Thank you for your time. Thank you so much for that presentation.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.960
I'm going to first call on Member Darling-Hammond for comments.

01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:03.440
President Darling-Hammond? Yeah, I have to get myself off of mute.

01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:08.960
It's always the challenge, right? First, I just want to say I've been enjoying all of the

01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:16.000
presentations and really appreciate all of the great thinking from, you know, civic engagement to

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:21.040
diversity, equity, and inclusion, and all of the other topics. This one is near and dear to my

01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:26.960
heart because I'm an educational researcher when I'm not sitting at the state board table, and I

01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:32.080
just want to say that I think your recommendations are very thoughtful, and they're really rooted in

01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:39.120
a lot of research on both how people learn and how, you know, effective teaching unfolds. So

01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:45.920
I think you're on very solid ground, and your examples are very telling and very much rooted

01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:50.960
in what we know from the science and the research on learning, development, and teaching. So I

01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:57.120
appreciate you raising this, and I think that, you know, to the degree that we've got a lot of

01:57:57.840 --> 01:58:02.720
additional resources finding their way to the field for professional development, as you called

01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:07.840
for, and how we shape that, I think, should be informed by the thinking that you presented. So

01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:12.000
thank you very much. Thank you, President Darling-Hammond. Member Rucker.

01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:21.520
Thank you very much. I hadn't commented on the previous couple of presentations, but I'm glad

01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:27.520
to follow our board president in commenting on this because not only is the topic you raised

01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:33.200
about student support and paying attention to student learning needs important, but it's also

01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:40.160
very, very prescient. With California doing an annual healthy student survey,

01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:48.560
a lot of the recommendations you made also, to me, has impact and even informed some decisions

01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:54.640
about the kinds of items or questions that are included for students in the survey. Because while

01:58:54.640 --> 01:59:00.240
we make a lot of assumptions about what students do and how students make decisions about school

01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:05.680
and coursework and even the relationship they have with their parents and supporting them through

01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:13.760
school, there are some critical relationships at the school campus that really do not get full

01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:20.000
consideration in the kinds of school planning we are currently doing to improve student support for

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:25.680
our school. So I really appreciate not only the thoughtfulness for your recommendation, but the

01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:31.600
attention to this particular topic that doesn't always get the full consideration for school

01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:36.960
planning and school improvement that we really should have. And while we may not be able to act

01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:43.600
on it for a separate item, we'll be looking at content item five and updating the LCAP template.

01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:50.160
I think our future conversations about student support and student support services will really

01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:56.160
be informed by your recommendations. So Ms. Nong, I do really want to thank you and appreciate

01:59:56.160 --> 02:00:02.240
your ideas and your very, very important recommendations in this report. And thank

02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:11.360
your team as well. Member McQuillin. Great presentation, Linda. Good work. I agree with

02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:17.360
what's been said so far and the feedback. And I remember some of the feedback in our prep for this

02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:23.520
that some of the training you're talking about is involved in teacher preparation programs now,

02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:28.560
but we know so many of our professionals have been out of their training for a few years,

02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:34.160
so we need to make sure that this professional development is incorporated to all districts

02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:40.560
currently. So again, thank you for your presentation and great work.

02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:46.080
Thank you. Stephanie and Michelle, I'll turn it over to you for our final item.

02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:53.280
Our final presentation will be on the topic of socioeconomic support presented by Audrey Hong.

02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:59.680
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond and esteemed board members. My name is Audrey

02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:04.480
Hong and I'm a junior attending Beckman High School in the Tustin Unified School District.

02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:08.400
On behalf of the Student Advisory Board of Education, we strongly recommend the State

02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:13.360
Board of Education develop a plan for local education agencies to better communicate to

02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:18.800
both students and parents about accessible resources. As a student from Beckman High

02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:23.840
School, I'm not always exposed to the struggles of socioeconomic setbacks on a daily basis.

02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:29.200
Growing up on this bubble led me to be unable to identify the countless struggles

02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:35.120
experienced by students of low socioeconomic status. This all changed when I partnered with

02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:39.920
Skyview three years ago. Skyview is a public school in Anaheim that serves homeless families

02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:44.800
throughout Orange County. My many experiences with this organization, from cleaning the resource

02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:50.000
center to partaking in reading workshops with special needs students, my eyes are truly open.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:54.960
I was able to connect with these students and I felt their passion for their education and how

02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:59.600
they have fought through countless socioeconomic setbacks that the education system predisposed

02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:05.520
into. When discussing educational issues with nine students from different and diverse areas

02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:10.560
in California, exposed the disproportionate struggles students of low socioeconomic

02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:15.760
backgrounds face. I'm sure all of you are aware that schools lack adequate methods of relaying

02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:21.520
information on accessible resources such as scholarship opportunities, job opportunities,

02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:26.080
or peer tutoring to help students of all socioeconomic backgrounds, especially students

02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:31.120
coming from low-income families. At Northwood High School in Irvine, a student wanted a Chinese

02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:37.040
dictionary for the PSDT but was unable to access it. In Solano County, a student wanted to join

02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:41.760
extracurriculars such as cheer but was unable to join because they could not afford the gear.

02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:46.800
In Lincoln High School in San Joaquin County, a student was unable to buy the textbook and felt

02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:52.240
too uncomfortable to ask the teacher for accommodations. Many students throughout California

02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:57.840
are unable to pay for the AP exams that they want to take, afford private tutoring, or even spend

02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:02.960
adequate time on schoolwork as they carry the additional responsibility of financially supporting

02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:08.880
their family. This sets different students on different tracks for success from the very beginning.

02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:14.080
We do not believe that it's the school's resources that are causing these issues,

02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:18.400
but the lack of awareness of the free and equitable resources that our schools have been

02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:24.080
given to students. We are not proposing to create new resources or implementations in California

02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:29.360
schools, but to recommend the State Board of Education to develop a plan for local education

02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:34.720
agencies to better communicate to both students and parents about these accessible resources.

02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:39.200
This framework is geared towards all students in K-12 to help them navigate their education

02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:44.640
through free and equitable resources and therefore shaping a more independent generation of the

02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:50.720
future. This implementation of this communication plan by the California Department of Education

02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:55.120
will not only ensure that students are aware of these opportunities, but will acknowledge

02:03:55.120 --> 02:04:00.160
and respond to students' concerns and struggles. The communication plan would provide various ways

02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:04.560
to promote opportunities for students that give districts options to what would work best for

02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:10.640
the student population, ensuring better awareness of opportunities given to students. We are wanting

02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:15.280
to improve the evident achievement gap in California education. The California Assessment of

02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:20.080
Student Performance and Progress revealed that nearly two-thirds of students from low-income

02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:24.720
families did not meet grade-level standards, while one-third of students not within the low

02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:31.040
income category exceeded standards. As these findings show, it is critical to ensure that

02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:36.720
one's income does not determine their quality of education. Our proposal will ensure that all

02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:42.560
students have access to educational resources including scholarship opportunities, job resumes,

02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:49.040
tutoring services, and financial support. Today, I'm speaking on behalf of that student who's unable

02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:54.560
to access free tutoring, for that student who's working every day after school to support their

02:04:54.560 --> 02:05:00.080
family, and for those students that I met at Skyview who are not conscious of their limitless

02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:05.600
potential that they hold. As we, the students, are the primary partners of our education,

02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:10.800
it is crucial that all students are given the tools to succeed. And for these reasons, in order

02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:16.240
to better communicate to both students and parents, we recommend the State Board of Education develop

02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:22.400
a plan for local education agencies regarding accessible resources. I hope that the State of

02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:27.520
California can open the way towards an education system that gives equal opportunity for all

02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:33.120
students, regardless of their socioeconomic status or their identity. Thank you for your time and I

02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:41.520
welcome any feedback. Thank you so much, Audrey. I have to say I so appreciate all the students

02:05:42.080 --> 02:05:47.760
making this a personal connection to their own personal experience, giving us specifics from

02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:53.760
their own school and district experiences, and then adding resources and research that they did

02:05:53.760 --> 02:06:00.080
to support the proposal. So I just think it is so articulate and well prepared and I just so appreciate

02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:06.240
listening to it. With that, I'm going to call on board member Banaka first. Please go ahead with

02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:13.200
your comments. Thank you. And again, I just wanted to thank you all for creating this really

02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:19.680
comprehensive proposal. I know coming from a school where a vast or rather an overwhelming

02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:25.040
majority of students are socioeconomically disadvantaged, I have personally seen the

02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:32.000
extent to which socioeconomic status affects academic success. And I think that most of this

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:38.240
is really it boils down to a discrepancy between the resources and opportunities that wealthy and

02:06:38.240 --> 02:06:44.000
not wealthy students utilize. And the reason why I think this is such a great proposal is because

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:50.000
many students simply aren't aware of the resources that are already in place. And that doesn't do

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:55.920
anyone any good if no one knows what resources are already in place, because then they'll never get

02:06:55.920 --> 02:07:01.360
used to their fullest ability. So I really like the way that you approach this issue. And I again

02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:04.400
want to commend you for all the hard work and effort that you put into this proposal.

02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:07.920
Thank you for your comments. President Darling-Hammond.

02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:15.440
I also want to thank you for the proposal and just note that we've been on a path in California

02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:22.960
toward trying to invest more equitably in schools through the more progressive formula for funding

02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:30.480
from local control funding formula and the recent allocations of funds for recovery from the

02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:34.560
pandemic from both the federal and state governments. And I think your comments

02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:43.920
really put a fine point on how those resources should be spent to really most effectively

02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:52.400
support students who deserve and require the kind of supports that other families

02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:59.920
can sometimes purchase from disposable income. So I think you've raised some really excellent

02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:05.360
points. And we're actually in a position to take advantage of that kind of advice

02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:11.520
as we think about how to allocate these new resources. Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:20.400
Member McQuillen. Great presentation, Audrey, and a great topic. You know, it reminds me of

02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:29.120
all the channels we need to make sure we're using to get the word out to families that resources

02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:34.320
do exist. You know, there are alternative channels that need to be exercised. You know,

02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:41.040
not all of our families have good stable internet. You know, there's embarrassment to consider

02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:46.320
of students and families who don't ask. And then what you brought up, there are other things

02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:53.600
happening for families where maybe the student has become the caretaker. So you brought up so

02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:58.400
many good points that we need to be reminded of throughout California. So thank you for your

02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:04.800
presentation. Great topic. Thank you, Member McQuillen. Member Rucker. Well, thank you very

02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:13.120
much for your comments and your report on this very sensitive topic. And I agree with everything

02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:20.400
our board president and my colleague, Jim McQuillen, stated about this issue. My entire teaching

02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:25.920
career, I worked in a low wealth district. Low wealth because that was the size of the budget

02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:31.600
in that district. When I started teaching, my salary was $9,000 a year. And that wasn't back

02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:38.000
in 1940. It was in the latter part of the 20th century. That's still a long time ago, but that's

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:43.280
beside the point. But also it was a low wealth district because the majority of students

02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:51.280
came from families that received some form of public assistance or even were in foster care.

02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:58.480
So the issues and conditions for student learning and the issues and conditions that I worked in as

02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:06.000
a teacher were not unknown. And surprisingly, they have not changed really over time. But while it's

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:13.280
not unknown, I have to say I have never heard the issues and those conditions so eloquently

02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:22.640
addressed as you did today without politicizing the disparity in economic opportunity and resource

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:30.560
equity issues that low wealth schools and the students that attend them have. So not only do

02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:38.000
I appreciate the way that you framed the issue, but also how you very clearly articulated the very

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:44.240
specific examples of what the impacts are and what's not being considered and planning how to

02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:50.720
support and provide resources to these families without embarrassing students, without requiring

02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:55.920
students and their families to respond or have to ask, you know, why do you need to have people ask

02:10:55.920 --> 02:11:00.480
for something when we already know what the circumstances are that they are dealing with?

02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:06.560
So I do appreciate not only the report that your team put together, but the way you framed how the

02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:12.720
recommendations can actually be successfully implemented as a function of doing their LCAP

02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:18.560
planning for any school side of school district where these issues are not only clear and apparent,

02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:24.560
but are actually the norm, not the exception. I also appreciate your sensitivity and your attention

02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:30.320
to the privilege that you've been able to enjoy and why you're concerned personally about why this

02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:35.280
should make a difference for everyone. I was actually moved emotionally when you made that

02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:39.280
point. So thank you so very much and congratulations on a job well done.

02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:47.440
So thank you very much for your comments, Member Rucker. I really appreciated that and I know the

02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:53.200
students do as well. Do we have any other board member comments before we go to public comment?

02:11:56.400 --> 02:12:02.240
Stephanie and Michelle, do you have any comments that you want to share as the coordinators?

02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:07.760
Yes, I would just like to once again thank the esteemed board members for listening to our

02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:14.240
proposals from this year's SAIP Conference and for providing such valuable feedback and support. I

02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:19.120
sincerely, sincerely hope that very shortly we can turn these ideas that started in Zoom breakout

02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:24.240
rooms into actions implemented by you, the SAIP Board of Education. Thank you again.

02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:30.480
Well, I have to say to the students, the energy they put in over Halloween weekend

02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:38.000
weekend and I know they spend days and nights and hours writing and drafting the presentation.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:44.240
We're going to now stop for public comment on item three. The call-in number is on the slide,

02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:57.680
712-770-4991. There's an access code 396-1805. So we will now turn over to public comment.

02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:04.960
So please turn your volume of your computer down and when it's your turn, then operator will

02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:11.040
announce that it's your time to speak. Do we have any public comments for this item?

02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:19.600
We do not have public comment for item three. So Pam, do you say there are no public comments?

02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:27.200
There are no public comments for item three. Okay, thank you so much. So we'll go back to

02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:36.000
board members for final comments on this. If there are any. Member McQuillan.

02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:43.200
I just want to congratulate all the students, you know, and I learned so much from all of you.

02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:50.160
You know, this is what it's all about, you know, the work that we do to serve you, the students,

02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:54.720
and you're the voice for the California students. I'm just so pleased with all the

02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:59.680
presentations. So thank you. Thank you very much. And UROCs would say walk thou,

02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:03.840
walk thou, and that's a heartfelt thank you in the UROC language.

02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:14.080
Member Banaka. Yeah, I would just like to echo Member McQuillan's remarks. I want to commend

02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:20.160
every single person that was involved in creating these proposals. As I said before,

02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:25.600
I got to see firsthand how much hard work and effort went into this. It's incredible and

02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:31.200
baffling, and I hope that everyone could see it at one point in their lives because before then,

02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:38.720
I had never seen so many students that were so dedicated and so hardworking, willing to spend

02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:43.520
their Halloween weekend, as I said before, their Halloween weekend, creating these proposals. So

02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:48.480
again, a big congratulations to all the students involved. Member Rodriguez.

02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:56.400
Also, I want to echo what's been said, and my hope is that you can look back in a few years and see

02:14:56.400 --> 02:15:04.560
how your dedicated leadership has created change, and I really appreciate your sensitivity,

02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:10.160
your compassion, your experiences, and especially your voice. Thank you so much.

02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:19.360
So I just want to comment that we had six amazing teams. So for all the students who are

02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:26.640
did this remotely on top of all their schoolwork and commitment, I want to thank our group one,

02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:33.920
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion. Amazing work. Great message. Again, this is on our addendum

02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:40.080
attached to the board agenda for the public to access for additional follow-up.

02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:46.080
Topic two was post high school preparedness. Topic three, student wellness.

02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:56.560
Topic four, civic engagement. Topic five, equitable education, and topic six, socioeconomic support.

02:15:57.280 --> 02:16:04.240
So relevant to the work we're talking about and all the connections to all the work in schools.

02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:10.800
Students, on behalf of the state board, we thank you so much for your time and commitment,

02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:17.360
and trust us that your message and specifics will carry forward into our work.

02:16:17.360 --> 02:16:25.440
So thank you very, very much. And with that, this does end our presentations

02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:36.400
for this item, and we will now take a 10-minute break. So it is 1045 on my clock, so we will

02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:43.520
come back at 1055. So thank you all very much. Board members, please turn off your cameras

02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:52.160
and your microphones. Thank you. Thank you all back, and we need to reestablish

02:16:52.160 --> 02:17:03.360
a quorum, so Brooks, please call the roll. Member Sun. Here. Vice President Stroud. Here.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.520
Member Rucker. Present. Member Rodriguez.

02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:27.920
I can see member Rodriguez. Member Petillo-Brownson. Here. Member McQuillan.

02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:40.800
Here. Member Glover-Woods. Here. Member Escobedo. Here. President Darling-Hammond. Here. Member Burr.

02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:47.040
Here. Member Bonacca. Here. We have a quorum.

02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:56.480
Terrific. At this point, I will reopen agenda item one and turn it over to the state superintendent

02:17:56.480 --> 02:18:10.320
to provide his report. Good morning, Madam President, Vice President, members of the board.

02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:16.240
Thank you for the opportunity to share with you just a few key highlights and to take any questions

02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:20.880
that you may have about a number of initiatives that are taking place at the Department of

02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:25.920
Education. Many of them you already know because I've seen many of you at many of the meetings,

02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:32.320
board liaisons and others present at the meetings. As I begin, I want to just recognize the moment

02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:37.040
in time where we are. Still probably the most difficult time that we'll experience in our

02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:42.000
lifetime, but our schools are open and we're keeping students safe and families safe and we're

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:48.320
doing all that we can to make sure that they can be safe and can learn. In that respect,

02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:54.960
I want to commend our students. I want to commend educators, family members, the entire

02:18:55.680 --> 02:19:03.040
community for being resilient and doing the things that we need to do to overcome

02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:10.000
what the coronavirus has presented to us. As I mentioned, our schools are open and have been

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:14.960
open and as I said at the last report in the last board meeting, I've had a chance to visit

02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:21.440
many many of our schools as they reopen. As you know, some schools have experienced challenges in

02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:28.480
how to deal with quarantine conditions and but overall our schools have found the way to stay

02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:34.640
open and stay safe and to do so at a rate is much higher than almost any other state. When it comes

02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:40.960
to school closures, school closures in California happen at about 1 12th the national rate and I

02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:48.400
emphasize that to say that what everyone is doing is working. Using vaccines, rapid COVID testing

02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:53.360
and all the things that social distancing, disinfecting our schools, every aspect of our

02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:58.480
school community is making this happen and so we're grateful for that. Obviously big things are

02:19:58.480 --> 02:20:04.480
happening around the questions of vaccines. By some October numbers, nearly 60 percent of

02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:10.560
California students between the ages of 12 and 17 have received a vaccine. We're pivoting our focus

02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:18.320
to more vaccines because the delta variant demands it. We have learned that that the delta variant

02:20:18.320 --> 02:20:23.280
is more resistant to many vaccines and so Californians are beginning to get their boosters.

02:20:23.280 --> 02:20:28.400
I had a chance to get my booster last week at a great event at La Clinica, I'm sorry, at Ultimed

02:20:29.680 --> 02:20:36.720
in Southgate and a chance to really say to the world let us lean into vaccines especially now

02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:43.120
that we have approvals for students between the ages of five and 17. And so we need to work to

02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:49.200
amplify the importance of vaccines and of course foreshadowing where we think the state will be

02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:56.240
heading with the vaccine requirement that will be for students. By my notes, we expect that in just

02:20:57.040 --> 02:21:04.560
in several months, students in grades seven through 12 by 2022, in July of 2022, will be

02:21:04.560 --> 02:21:11.920
required to have a vaccine and that shortly thereafter that grades K through six will have

02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:16.960
the opportunity to have a vaccine according to the requirement. And we look forward to working

02:21:16.960 --> 02:21:21.440
closely with everyone, every aspect of the governor's office, the state board of education,

02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:26.720
the department of public health, and school leaders on how that rollout will take place.

02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:30.880
We've had many conversations already with school leaders to hear their thoughts, their questions,

02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:35.120
their concerns about what a new mandate might look like. And we have some run-up time,

02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:40.080
we have some lead time to really work through what implementation might look like. I also want to

02:21:40.080 --> 02:21:45.520
commend our school communities that have been impacted by fire. As if the coronavirus challenges

02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:51.040
weren't enough, many of our communities have been impacted by fire. As if dealing with racial

02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:57.680
injustices was not enough, we have probably some 19 counties that have seen that they've been

02:21:57.680 --> 02:22:04.880
impacted by fire. I want to give a great shout out to our emergency services team that has worked

02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:09.040
with these school communities to get them resources, to connect the resources, to work

02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:14.240
through the requirements for FEMA, for other agencies that offer support, to work with the

02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:18.640
various offices like the Office of Emergency Services and others that have been providing

02:22:18.640 --> 02:22:25.600
support, and that who've worked with our CDE Foundation to raise a few dollars to provide

02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:32.720
gas cards and you know cards for food and hotel expenses and things of that nature.

02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:38.720
We know that it's a huge challenge, but again we want to commend those who are showing resiliency

02:22:38.720 --> 02:22:44.960
and finding ways to ensure that our students continue to learn. As we think about this shift

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:51.520
of approvals for young children between the ages of five and 11 to get a vaccine,

02:22:51.520 --> 02:22:56.960
we are accelerating our outreach efforts. Many of you know that I've been working with a group

02:22:57.680 --> 02:23:06.240
called Andele Que Esperas, hurry up why you wait, hurry up why wait. This is a statewide campaign

02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:12.320
that is reaching out to 4.5 million Latinos in the state to ensure that there's great outreach

02:23:12.320 --> 02:23:18.240
in English and in Spanish to support vaccine outreach. And so as I mentioned, four and a half

02:23:18.240 --> 02:23:26.640
million folks will be reached. Anyone can get information at 855.yaandele or andelequeesperas.com.

02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:32.160
It's been a great partnership with organizations like AltaMed and other federally qualified health

02:23:32.160 --> 02:23:37.280
clinics that are supporting vaccine outreach to some of the communities that are facing the

02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:42.160
highest level of risk for COVID infection. And so we hope to reach four and a half million folks

02:23:42.160 --> 02:23:47.920
throughout our state and to engage many many. I want to think aspirationally for a second.

02:23:47.920 --> 02:23:53.840
Many of you know that during the last weeks we have announced some new initiatives at the department

02:23:53.840 --> 02:24:00.000
that the state board has been a great partner in. We're excited to talk about an effort to

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:04.640
ensure that all students read by third grade and we've given ourselves a homework assignment to

02:24:04.640 --> 02:24:11.440
say that that should happen by 2026. And so with that we have a task force that will be making

02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:17.280
recommendations on how to get us to reading by third grade by 2026. And we've made a part of

02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:22.880
that strategy getting a million books in the hands of students who have need. Many have already come

02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:26.640
forward and made donations. Thank you to those who've heard our call for books. We'll continue to

02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:32.880
work with groups like First Five California on how to get book donations to support California

02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:38.240
students. For those who would like to support by making a donation, send us a note at state

02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:44.400
literacy campaign at cde.ca.gov. We're grateful for those of you who've already stepped up. And

02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:49.040
of course I want to thank Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond for being among those who will be helping us in

02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:54.240
leading this effort as one of our co-chairs of this task force on reading by third grade.

02:24:54.240 --> 02:25:00.160
I've also named a task force that is focused on supporting the needs of black students in our

02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:05.600
state. And as you all know, I'm deeply committed to supporting all of our students. But recognizing

02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:11.680
that gaps have not closed at the same rate as they have for other groups, that gaps for black

02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:16.400
students have not closed at the same rate, we are going to accelerate our efforts in supporting

02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:22.400
black students and be explicit about the need for addressing disproportionality, the impacts of

02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:28.160
systemic racism, the impacts of segregated schools, and the impacts of poverty and other

02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:32.720
conditions that affect the socioeconomic status of many of our students. And so this task force

02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:37.920
will also be making recommendations for how we will look at every single item where there's

02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:42.960
disproportionality affecting black students, whether that's graduation rates, chronic absenteeism,

02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:48.000
suspensions and expulsions, how do we provide more professional development and diversification

02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:53.440
of our school workforces to support them. I'm grateful that we also have board member Patil

02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:58.720
Bronson working closely with this task force and helping us as a member of the task force

02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:03.200
and helping us to move forward. Many have asked why. Why name these task forces now?

02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:06.960
If you take a look at the most robust state budget that I think we have seen for education

02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:12.800
and who knows how long, I feel as though we have the resources and we have the will to get this

02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:18.640
done. When you think about $4.3 billion for mental health, when you think about universal TK

02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:23.600
available for every four-year-old, universal meals for any hungry student, universal expanded

02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:30.160
learning, $10 million for anti-racism grants, you think about all these things linked together.

02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:34.800
There are many, many investments in the state budget that focus directly on professional

02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:43.600
development to support literacy. I was grateful to be with board member Burr about a week ago

02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:50.880
at CCEE where we had a robust discussion about grants that will be available for expanded learning

02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:57.920
with a focus on reading and math and science. All that to say that we have the resources

02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:05.120
that we need to move this forward. And certainly none more important than nearly $3 billion

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:10.960
in community schools investments. I know that that is scheduled to be discussed at a later

02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:16.960
point in this meeting. I just would be remiss to not recognize the important transformative effect

02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:21.680
that community schools can have, both on wraparound services for students as we try to

02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:26.720
recover from the trauma of the pandemic, but also to address issues around racial justice

02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:31.920
and social justice. These will be important resources. And you will hear in the days and

02:27:31.920 --> 02:27:37.040
weeks to come that I'll be appointing a steering committee that will speak to, you know, a broad

02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:42.800
representation of interests and how to guide the community school strategy. All of these things

02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:48.880
together, I believe, will help us to have a breakthrough in how we support black students,

02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:52.800
how we reach reading by third grade. I thank all the board members who have been in these

02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:58.720
conversations so far. Thank you, Board Member McQuillin, for joining the meetings that we've had

02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:04.800
with our American Indian Education Oversight Committee, really helping us to center our

02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:09.840
efforts to support our Native American students. It was an honor to give testimony in a specialized

02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:15.200
committee, a joint committee, through the Assembly Education and Select Committee on Native American

02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:21.040
interests and needs, and to continue to figure out how we change the narrative about reducing

02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:25.600
chronic absenteeism, about increasing graduation, about supporting Native American students,

02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:29.920
and about recasting what gets taught in our schools as it relates to Native American studies.

02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:35.840
We know that there is an opportunity for us to broaden what gets taught there. And again,

02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:40.320
thank you, Board Member McQuillin, for joining those meetings. Thank you, Board Members, for

02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:46.080
hearing these highlights. Thank you for your interest and your energy in supporting our students.

02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:50.160
Thank you to all of the staff at the California Department of Education,

02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:54.960
and all of the staff at the State Board of Education for continuing to do incredible work

02:28:54.960 --> 02:29:00.320
in these very, very difficult times. I just want to show my appreciation and acknowledgement for

02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:04.880
all of you. And then, Madam President, this concludes my report, and I'd be happy to take

02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:13.760
any questions that you and board members may have. Thank you very much. Seeing no hands raised,

02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:22.560
we'll go on to item number five, which is the Local Control and Accountability Plan template,

02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:27.680
the adoption of the revised Local Control and Accountability Plan template,

02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:32.480
and the template for the one-time supplement to the annual update to the 2021-22 Local Control

02:29:32.480 --> 02:29:37.600
and Accountability Plan. And the CDE recommends that we adopt the proposed revisions to the

02:29:37.600 --> 02:29:42.560
LCAP template and the proposed draft of the supplement template and instructions,

02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:47.040
and allow the CDE, in collaboration with State Board staff, to make any necessary

02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:51.600
typographical or formatting corrections as the documents are prepared for posting

02:29:52.160 --> 02:29:56.560
on the CDE website. And this item will be presented by Lindsay Ternetour

02:29:57.200 --> 02:30:01.120
and Josh Strong of the CDE. Lindsay, please begin.

02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:13.280
Good afternoon. Sorry. Let me get the height adjustment.

02:30:20.880 --> 02:30:27.120
All right. Good afternoon. Good morning. Sorry. Good morning still. President Darling-Hammond,

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Chief Deputy Nicely, members of the board, Executive Director Allen. It is my pleasure

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:36.400
to be here with all of you again today. My name is Lindsay Ternetour, and I'm the Director of the

02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:41.600
Student Achievement and Support Division. I am joined today again by my colleague, Joshua Strong,

02:30:41.600 --> 02:30:46.800
who is the Administrator of the Local Agency System Support Office, or LASSO, in the Student

02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:52.000
Achievement and Support Division. Josh and I are here to provide an update on the five proposed

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:58.720
revisions to the Local Control and Accountability Plan as prescribed by SB 98 and AB 130,

02:30:58.720 --> 02:31:04.240
which were introduced and discussed during the September 2021 SBE meeting. Specifically,

02:31:04.240 --> 02:31:08.640
we will revisit each of the five revisions and focus on the following three questions.

02:31:09.280 --> 02:31:14.160
Since the September SBE meeting, what have our educational partners been saying about the

02:31:14.160 --> 02:31:20.080
revisions? How is our educational partner input included in the proposed revisions of the templates

02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:25.040
and instructions? And how will the CDE support capacity building to implement the proposed

02:31:25.040 --> 02:31:30.800
revisions following the anticipated board adoption today? During the September State Board meeting,

02:31:30.800 --> 02:31:35.520
we heard the concerns and comments from all of you regarding the length and complexity of the LCAP.

02:31:36.160 --> 02:31:41.600
We have prepared for all of your consideration today a few areas that will help to reduce the

02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:48.320
length of the plan effective for the 22-23 LCAP. Finally, this presentation will conclude with an

02:31:48.320 --> 02:31:54.000
overview of the CDE's next steps for supporting all LEAs in implementing the new requirements to

02:31:54.000 --> 02:32:02.880
the LCAP following today's anticipated board action. Item five today is an action item,

02:32:02.880 --> 02:32:07.120
and therefore the CDE respectfully brings the following recommendation for your consideration.

02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:12.160
The CDE recommends that the State Board of Education adopt the proposed revisions to the

02:32:12.160 --> 02:32:18.000
LCAP template and the proposed draft of the 21-22 supplement template and instructions.

02:32:18.720 --> 02:32:25.360
In addition, the CDE recommends three additional revisions that are not in the template and that

02:32:25.360 --> 02:32:30.800
were discussed after we posted the template and instructions. The first is within the increased

02:32:30.800 --> 02:32:35.600
or improved services section of the template, the CDE recommends including the dollar amount

02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:42.400
associated with LCFF carryover in addition to the percentage. Within the instructions for the

02:32:42.400 --> 02:32:47.840
goals and actions section, the CDE recommends including a hyperlink to the list of LEAs that

02:32:47.840 --> 02:32:54.240
are required to include one or more required goals in the LCAP. And third, within the instructions for

02:32:54.240 --> 02:32:59.440
the increased or improved services section of the template, the CDE recommends that the reference to

02:32:59.440 --> 02:33:06.080
October 6 be replaced with the first Wednesday in October. The CDE also recommends that the State

02:33:06.080 --> 02:33:12.000
Board allow the CDE in collaboration with State Board staff to make any necessary typographical

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:17.120
or formatting corrections as the documents are prepared for posting on the CDE website.

02:33:20.320 --> 02:33:24.960
The next few slides will set the context before we dive into each of the recommended revisions

02:33:24.960 --> 02:33:31.760
in the LCAP template and instructions and the one-time supplement template to the annual update

02:33:31.760 --> 02:33:37.920
to the 21-22 LCAP. The slide displayed here provides an analysis of the CDE's engagement

02:33:37.920 --> 02:33:44.480
with the field since July of 2021. Approximately 1,000 individuals have participated in webinars,

02:33:44.480 --> 02:33:48.720
small group feedback sessions, statewide meetings, and submission of public comment.

02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:53.600
We want to thank our educational partners for their continued commitment of sharing their unique

02:33:53.600 --> 02:34:01.520
perspectives about the LCAP and the LCAP process. The proposed revised LCAP template and instructions

02:34:02.080 --> 02:34:07.280
along with the proposed draft of the template and instructions for the 21-22 supplement

02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:12.720
reflect the collaborative efforts of CDE and SBE staff, the LCAP advisory group,

02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:14.640
and educational partners throughout the state.

02:34:17.760 --> 02:34:23.040
This item has six attachments, so I want to provide a quick overview of what each attachment's purpose

02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:27.840
is. So attachment one provides a summary of the revisions to the LCAP template and

02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:33.440
instructions and the requirements for the 21-22 supplement along with a summary of educational

02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:39.280
partners feedback. Attachment two provides the current LCAP template and instructions that was

02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:45.520
adopted by the the state board at its January 2020 meeting. Attachment three provides the initial

02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:51.920
draft of the LCAP template and instructions as required by SB 98 and AB 130 that was presented

02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:59.440
to the state board during the September 2021 meeting. Attachment four provides the initial

02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:04.720
draft of the 21-22 supplement and instructions that also was presented to the state board during

02:35:04.720 --> 02:35:11.120
the September meeting. Attachment five provides the proposed final draft of the revisions to the

02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:17.680
LCAP template and instructions as required by SB 98 and AB 130 and attachment six provides the

02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:23.040
proposed final draft of the proposed 21-22 supplement template and instructions.

02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:26.400
So today we'll be mainly focusing on attachments five and six.

02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:32.960
The five revisions listed on this slide were presented during the September meeting and

02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:39.200
introduced to the field beginning in July of 2021. The five revisions are proposed revision to

02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:44.800
replace the term stakeholder throughout the LCAP template and instructions, requirement to include

02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:49.920
specific goals in the LCAP, a requirement to calculate carryover, a requirement to use

02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:54.240
concentration grant add-on for increased staffing, and a requirement to complete

02:35:54.240 --> 02:35:58.000
one-time supplement to the annual update to the 21-22 LCAP.

02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:05.760
During September state board meeting we walked through each of the five revisions by answering

02:36:05.760 --> 02:36:11.520
five big questions. Why is this revision being proposed? When does the requirement begin? Who

02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:17.040
will this impact? What do they need to do? And how will they do it? But for today's meeting we'll

02:36:17.040 --> 02:36:22.640
focus on answering three new questions regarding each of the five revisions. What have our educational

02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:27.920
partners been saying about these revisions? How is our educational partner input included

02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:33.920
in the proposed revisions? And most very importantly, how will CDE support capacity building

02:36:33.920 --> 02:36:39.600
to implement the proposed revisions? To remain mindful of the time and the very packed agenda

02:36:39.680 --> 02:36:45.040
today, we will present all five revisions before pausing for questions, public comment, and board

02:36:45.040 --> 02:36:55.120
discussion. At the September 2021 meeting, the board gave very clear direction to the CDE

02:36:55.120 --> 02:37:00.560
to provide recommendations that could reduce redundancy and simplify the LCAP to ensure that

02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:06.720
the plan is accessible to all interested parties. In response to this request, the CDE has made

02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:11.840
several revisions in the proposed final draft LCAP template and instructions which is posted

02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:18.960
as attachment five. These changes include whenever possible, new information required to be included

02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:24.240
in the LCAP template and action tables has been added in a way that limits the increase in size

02:37:24.240 --> 02:37:31.920
of the LCAP and reduces duplication of effort for LEAs. Also, the CDE proposes that the instructions

02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:37.280
requiring LEAs to copy and retain the increased storm proof services section for each of the

02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:41.680
three years in the LCAP cycle be removed as this will decrease the length of the plan.

02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:47.920
Removing this requirement will not impact transparency as education code requires LEAs

02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:53.200
to post any LCAP adopted by the local governing board or body of the LEA on their website.

02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:59.120
The reason that the CDE did not make broader sweeping changes to the LCAP template for this

02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:03.680
round of revisions is because we received feedback from many of our educational partners

02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:08.720
who requested that we wait until the next three year cycle to make additional changes to the

02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:13.520
LCAP. It is the shared perspective of our colleagues in the field that to change the

02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:18.960
LCAP template and instructions amidst the three year cycle would be overly burdensome for LEAs

02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:24.560
even if they were not also managing an ongoing pandemic. Therefore, the CDE would like to propose

02:38:24.560 --> 02:38:30.080
that we in collaboration with our educational partners continue to evaluate the LCAP template

02:38:30.080 --> 02:38:34.720
and instructions within the coming year to identify other areas in which the LCAP could

02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:41.200
potentially be streamlined for the next three year cycle beginning in 2024. And I just will mention

02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:46.480
you know we've already begun leading this conversation with our LEA partners. Just yesterday

02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:51.840
afternoon we we had a conversation with our county office education partners and discussed

02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:57.120
where we could streamline the LCAP. Also working with our our agencies and I think we have a list

02:38:57.120 --> 02:39:07.840
of about 12 places to start so far and to grow. All right so let's dive into the the five proposed

02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:12.880
revisions. So the first one that we will start with today is to replace the term stakeholder

02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:18.320
throughout the LCAP template and instructions. And the reason that we are bringing this proposal to

02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:23.440
all of you is because we received some feedback in speaking with some of our LEA partners

02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:28.560
that the term stakeholder is creating a barrier of participation for some of our community members

02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:33.360
particularly our Native American communities. Primarily because the term the current term

02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:37.760
does not acknowledge the fact that Native American tribes are sovereign nations with

02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:42.400
constitutionally protected rights and thus created a barrier to engagement.

02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:48.560
So the CDE created an online survey to ask members of the public what they thought the new term should

02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:55.360
be. The survey was live from October 4th through October 14th and it collected 647 responses.

02:39:56.320 --> 02:40:02.080
Respondents included administrators, educators, parents, or family members, school board members,

02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:08.000
researchers, advocates, students, and policy makers. Respondents ranked their preference

02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:13.920
of a new term from four options and also had a write-in option. The four options were educational

02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:20.640
partner, educational collaborator, educational community member, and interested parties. And

02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:24.880
the number one preference from the survey respondents across the majority of the roles

02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:32.480
was educational partner. So therefore the CDE is recommending that the term stakeholder be replaced

02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:36.480
with the term educational partner throughout the LCAP template and instructions.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:43.840
And the one-time supplement to the annual update to the 21-22 LCAP.

02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:51.360
As far as capacity building all divisions and branches throughout the California Department

02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:55.920
of Education are committed to equity. We are currently working on implementing the replacement

02:40:55.920 --> 02:41:03.760
of the term stakeholder with educational partner. You can see this outward facing through our local

02:41:03.760 --> 02:41:08.560
agency system support office who have already adopted the use of educational partners

02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:12.640
in their daily correspondence and during their professional development series or their Tuesday

02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:21.840
at two webinars. Okay, moving on to the second revision. The requirement to include specific

02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:29.200
goals in the LCAP. The reason for this requirement is that the legislative intention is twofold.

02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:34.960
One to ensure that LEAs are addressing the needs of consistently low performing student groups

02:41:34.960 --> 02:41:40.560
and two to ensure that higher performing LEAs are addressing the needs of low performing schools

02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:47.680
within that LEA. Feedback from statewide educational partners centered around the need

02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:52.480
for additional clarification related to the criteria for identifying LEAs that will be

02:41:52.480 --> 02:41:58.080
required to include a specific goal, clarity related to what the specific goals must include,

02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:02.320
and a desire to see the required goals identified as supporting the improvement

02:42:02.320 --> 02:42:05.440
of chronically low performing student groups and or schools.

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:12.880
In response to our educational partners requests you will see updates to the instructions on page

02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:19.040
24 of attachment 5. Specifically the instructions related to the required goals have been revised

02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:24.640
to provide greater specificity about what must be addressed within the required goals

02:42:24.720 --> 02:42:29.680
including identification of student groups or schools and metrics and actions specific

02:42:29.680 --> 02:42:35.520
to reach the student group or school. Instructions were added to the identified needs prompt within

02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:41.840
the plan summary of the LCAP requiring that LEAs identify if they are required to include a goal

02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:48.320
and the student groups or schools that led to this requirement. In October the CDS analysis

02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:54.080
measurement and accountability reporting division provided an information memo to the state board

02:42:54.080 --> 02:42:58.800
related to the identification of low performing student groups and low performing schools.

02:42:59.440 --> 02:43:06.080
The lists for the 22-23 LCAP have been posted on the CDE's local control funding formula webpage

02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:12.080
and will be updated annually. Additionally we have a recommendation for a revision that has come up

02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:18.880
since posting and that is the CDE would like to add the link to the list of the LEAs required to

02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:24.240
write the goals in the LCAP in the LCAP instructions which would be on page 24

02:43:24.240 --> 02:43:26.880
in the goals and actions section of attachment 5.

02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:35.920
Regarding capacity building the most important step in completing this requirement is knowing

02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:40.880
if you are required to complete the requirement so therefore the October memo submitted by our

02:43:40.880 --> 02:43:45.600
colleagues in the analysis measurement and accountability reporting division was the first

02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:51.360
notification to the field. The lists are posted on the CDE's LCFF webpage and will be updated

02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:56.560
annually each year that we have the data to update and the CDE will also include a link to the list

02:43:56.560 --> 02:44:03.280
in the LCAP template instructions. Also the CDE will be hosting a Tuesdays at 2 webinar on Tuesday

02:44:03.280 --> 02:44:10.640
January 13th 2022 to provide training for LEAs that must include a required goal in their 22-23

02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:16.240
LCAP. Through this training there are a couple of key messages that the CDE will be reinforcing

02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:21.680
to the field. A very important component of completing this section relies on LEAs understanding

02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:27.440
that while the data that has been used to identify the LEAs who are required to include specific

02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:36.080
goals in their LCAPs is based on 2017, 2018 and 2019 dashboard LEAs should use the most recently

02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:41.200
available data to assist in diagnosing and addressing student needs. This message aligns

02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:45.920
within the larger statewide system of supports efforts to build up LEAs local data literacy

02:44:45.920 --> 02:44:51.200
capacity. We will also be emphasizing the instructions that require these goals to

02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:57.440
include metrics, outcomes, actions and expenditures specific to addressing the needs of and improving

02:44:57.440 --> 02:45:02.560
outcomes for each of the student groups or schools whose performance outcomes triggered identification.

02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:11.040
And also finally well another emphasis point not finally in the explanation of why the LEA developed

02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:18.000
the goal they did there are two big areas that we will be highlighting that how actions and metrics

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:24.080
in the goal differ from previous efforts to improve and LEAs are also required to explain why

02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:30.480
the LEA believes actions metrics and expenditures included in this goal will help achieve the

02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:33.040
outcomes identified in the goal description.

02:45:36.880 --> 02:45:41.280
So before I turn it over to Josh to take us through the revisions related to the requirement

02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:46.960
to calculate carryover I want to provide some context to the history of how this requirement

02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:53.120
to calculate carryover came about and how we got to where we are today. In September of 2020

02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:58.880
Governor Newsom made a promise to address the issue raised by AB 1835 and the California State

02:45:58.880 --> 02:46:03.920
Auditor related to ensuring that our low-income English learner and foster youth students are

02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:10.480
being provided the level of services they are entitled to. In the 21-22 budget the administration

02:46:10.480 --> 02:46:15.600
followed through by proposing a statutory change that would ensure LEAs are both planning for

02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:20.480
and following through on actions and services that increase and improve services for students from

02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:25.520
low-income families English learners and foster youth while working within the increase and

02:46:25.520 --> 02:46:31.040
improve framework that was established during the inception of the LCFF and the LCFF expenditure

02:46:31.040 --> 02:46:37.440
regulations. In July of this year that proposal became law. The language not only represents a

02:46:37.440 --> 02:46:42.640
compromise struck between the administration and legislature but also responded to a critique of

02:46:42.640 --> 02:46:48.880
LCFF made by the California State Auditor. The passage of this statutory language and required

02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:54.400
work by the board this fall led to K through 12 education being recently removed from the

02:46:54.400 --> 02:47:00.240
auditor's high-risk list. We acknowledge that the steps to calculate carryover seem complex

02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:04.880
and technical but we know that it is worth it working through this complexity to achieve a

02:47:04.880 --> 02:47:10.080
clear and transparent accounting of how our unduplicated student groups are being served

02:47:10.080 --> 02:47:16.160
over and above the level of services provided to all students. So with that important background I

02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:20.800
will now turn it over to Josh to walk you through the improvements and changes to this piece of the

02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:28.800
LCAP. Thank you Lindsay. Good morning President Darling-Hammond, members of the board.

02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:35.360
As Lindsay mentioned my name is Joshua Strong. I'm the administrator of the local agency

02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:41.920
system support office here at the CDE. So in terms of the requirements to calculate

02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:48.800
carryover the feedback that we received from our educational partners requested additional

02:47:48.800 --> 02:47:56.400
a need for additional clarity within the LCAP instructions related to how LEAs would calculate

02:47:56.400 --> 02:48:02.480
the required percentage of planned qualitative improvements. That was one of the things that

02:48:02.480 --> 02:48:08.000
was touched on in the September presentation is the quantitative improvements and the

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:14.400
qualitative improvements. Additionally there was a desire for the calculations being performed

02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:22.160
within the action table to be provided within the instructions and clarification related to

02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:35.520
the carryover requirements. Next slide please. Thank you so in terms of how educational partner

02:48:35.520 --> 02:48:43.520
input was included within the template there's been a revision to the contributing actions annual

02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:50.560
updates table which more closely aligns with the statutory requirements and in addition to this

02:48:51.120 --> 02:49:01.440
within the LCFF carryover table which is on page 15 of attachment 5 there's an alignment of the

02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:13.440
LCFF carryover percentage to the LEA's estimated actual LCFF funding as opposed to the projected

02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:22.240
LCFF funding. This not only holds LEAs accountable for the funding that they have received through

02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:30.240
the year but it also has the added benefit of ensuring that LEAs that have experienced or are

02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:36.160
experiencing a declining enrollment are not held responsible to carryover funding that they didn't

02:49:36.160 --> 02:49:43.840
actually receive during the school year. In addition to this we provided specific instructions

02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:50.400
related to the required calculations and included an example of how an LEA might calculate the

02:49:50.400 --> 02:49:59.040
required percentage of planned qualitative improvement. The instructions provide the required

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:07.040
to provide the required calculations really provide transparency for the field in terms of

02:50:07.040 --> 02:50:14.960
how this would be done. The example provides LEAs with one method of how they might determine

02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:26.240
the proportional percentage without locking an LEA into a single formulaic response seeking to

02:50:26.240 --> 02:50:34.800
strike that balance between ensuring that LEAs are meeting the requirement but also have flexibility

02:50:35.680 --> 02:50:43.600
that was been part of the hallmark of of LCFF. And then third the revision of the increased or

02:50:43.600 --> 02:50:49.520
improved services section we're recommending provide the projected percentage to increase

02:50:49.520 --> 02:50:54.720
or improve services for the coming school year the proportional LCFF carryover percentage

02:50:55.680 --> 02:51:01.040
that will be calculated and the total percentage to increase or improve services which would be the

02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:10.000
combination of the projected percentage for the coming year plus the LCFF carryover percentage

02:51:10.720 --> 02:51:16.960
that would be the total LCFF increased or improved services percentage that the LEA would

02:51:17.520 --> 02:51:26.720
be required to demonstrate that it's meeting in the coming LCAP year. As previously noted

02:51:26.720 --> 02:51:32.640
we're also recommending that the dollar amount associated with the LCFF carryover be included

02:51:32.640 --> 02:51:41.520
in addition to the carryover percentage. So if we can move to the next slide how is it that the

02:51:41.520 --> 02:51:47.680
department's going to be supporting LEAs in building capacity related to these new requirements.

02:51:48.400 --> 02:51:56.640
We're going to be providing training webinars two specifically related to the new increased or

02:51:56.640 --> 02:52:03.760
improved services requirements and how those calculations work. Those will be those are

02:52:03.760 --> 02:52:09.840
scheduled for December 14th and December 16th. That's also going to touch on the carryover

02:52:09.840 --> 02:52:16.880
requirements. In addition the CDE will collaborate with county offices of education and other

02:52:16.880 --> 02:52:24.560
educational partners in terms of building out trainings and partnering in communicating with

02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:31.840
the field. The CDE is also going to hold regular office hours during the spring of 2022 to support

02:52:31.840 --> 02:52:39.360
LEAs in development of the 22-23 LCAP and we're we continue to be available to support LEAs

02:52:39.360 --> 02:52:52.640
through the LCFF inbox email account. Moving on to the required use of the concentration grant add-on

02:52:55.920 --> 02:53:00.320
what did we hear from our educational partners if we could move to the next slide.

02:53:01.520 --> 02:53:08.720
Thank you. So educational partners had a recommend there were a number of recommendations

02:53:08.720 --> 02:53:17.280
and proposals of tables to help more clearly report the staff to student ratios at each of the

02:53:17.280 --> 02:53:22.560
school at the school sites related to this requirement. There were also requests for

02:53:22.560 --> 02:53:30.320
additional guidance or instructions in for how LEAs would handle a situation where the amount of

02:53:30.320 --> 02:53:37.760
the additional concentration grant add-on that additional 15 percent is not sufficient to provide

02:53:37.760 --> 02:53:45.680
additional staff or in an instance where an LEA doesn't have comparison schools from which to

02:53:45.680 --> 02:53:53.440
describe how it's using the additional concentration grant add-on. So specifically an example of that

02:53:53.440 --> 02:54:05.680
would be an LEA in which all of the schools within that LEA are serving above or have schools

02:54:06.480 --> 02:54:12.560
that are serving above 55 percent enrollment of low-income English learner and foster youth

02:54:12.560 --> 02:54:20.880
students. How is it that they are implementing this requirement and then in addition we we've

02:54:20.880 --> 02:54:25.600
had requests for additional clarification is how to determine the staff to student ratios

02:54:26.880 --> 02:54:34.880
in terms of how those will be those will be used. So how does this show up then within the template

02:54:35.920 --> 02:54:42.160
The

02:54:44.560 --> 02:54:51.680
table that would there's been a table that's been included to enable LEAs to identify the staff to

02:54:51.680 --> 02:55:01.120
student ratios as applicable to the LEA. It allows the LEA flexibility depending on what type of LEA

02:55:01.120 --> 02:55:07.200
it is whether it's a k-12 elementary high school district whether it's a single school district

02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:16.480
etc. The instructions for the prompt have also been revised to address instances where the amount

02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:22.880
of the additional concentration grant add-on is not sufficient to provide additional staff

02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:30.720
to address instances where the LEA doesn't have comparison schools and how to determine the

02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:36.560
staff to student ratios that will be used in identifying the required staff to student ratios.

02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:47.840
Again the why of this requirement and the reason behind doing this is to ensure that those LEAs

02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:57.200
that are receiving this additional 15 percent concentration grant are using that in order to

02:55:57.200 --> 02:56:04.000
provide direct services to students at schools where students that are low income English

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:11.280
learner or foster youth make up 55 percent or more of the student body and so we think that

02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:18.720
these additional components within the template and within the instructions are going to allow

02:56:18.720 --> 02:56:24.720
LEAs to communicate this how they're meeting this requirement how it is that they're

02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:32.960
they're implementing this in a way that provides flexibility based on the local context of the LEA

02:56:32.960 --> 02:56:41.040
but also does so in a way that that is clear and understandable to the LEA's community.

02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:50.320
So how is the CDE going to help support LEAs in terms of implementation of this new requirement

02:56:51.040 --> 02:56:56.800
as previously noted where we have a number of webinars that are coming up specifically

02:56:56.800 --> 02:57:01.760
December 14th and 16th related to the increased or improved services requirements

02:57:02.640 --> 02:57:10.320
that also will include this additional concentration grant add-on again the regularly

02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:18.800
scheduled office hours and supporting LEAs through questions responses to questions received through

02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:25.760
the LCFF email account and so at this point I'll turn it back over to Lindsay

02:57:25.760 --> 02:57:31.920
to discuss the one-time supplement to the annual update to the 2021-22 LCAP.

02:57:33.680 --> 02:57:40.480
Thank you so much Josh. So the reason for the requirement to for LEAs to complete the

02:57:40.480 --> 02:57:46.160
one-time supplement to the annual update to the 21-22 LCAP is to provide local governing

02:57:46.160 --> 02:57:51.360
boards or bodies parents families and other educational partners with additional information

02:57:51.360 --> 02:57:56.000
related to the additional funds provided to LEAs in the 21-22 school year.

02:57:56.000 --> 02:58:01.040
As we all know the 21-22 budget act increased educational funding throughout our state at

02:58:01.040 --> 02:58:06.560
historic rate. The one-time supplement will give LEAs an opportunity to share their story of how

02:58:06.560 --> 02:58:12.320
they are using the funds received through the 21-22 budget act and federal emergency relief funds

02:58:12.320 --> 02:58:16.880
mainly the ESSER funds in a manner that is consistent with other applicable plans

02:58:16.880 --> 02:58:23.760
and in alignment with their 21-22 LCAPs. Feedback from statewide educational partners

02:58:23.760 --> 02:58:28.560
requested clarification related to the report that is required to be provided to the local

02:58:28.560 --> 02:58:35.600
local governing board or body of the LEA on or before February 28, 2022. Also a need for

02:58:35.600 --> 02:58:40.160
additional guidance as to the meaning of the phrase funds provided through the budget act of

02:58:40.400 --> 02:58:44.640
2021 that were not included in the LCAP and what the requirement entails.

02:58:46.240 --> 02:58:51.600
In response to this feedback the instructions for the 21-22 supplement have been revised to provide

02:58:51.600 --> 02:58:56.480
additional specificity related to the reporting requirement and these can be found in attachment

02:58:56.480 --> 02:59:03.120
six. Additional information has also been provided in the instructions to clarify the meaning of the

02:59:03.120 --> 02:59:08.480
phrase funds provided through the budget act of 2021 that were not included in the LCAP and the

02:59:08.480 --> 02:59:15.040
intent for this requirement and specifically we highlight the instructions highlight that LEAs

02:59:15.040 --> 02:59:20.320
have flexibility in deciding what funds are included in the LCAP and to what extent those

02:59:20.320 --> 02:59:25.600
funds are included. If the LEA received funding through the budget act of 21 that it would have

02:59:25.600 --> 02:59:31.200
typically included within its LCAP the funds provided in the budget act of 21 that were not

02:59:31.200 --> 02:59:37.200
included in the LCAP and provided description of how the LEA has engaged its educational partners

02:59:37.200 --> 02:59:43.600
on the use of funds. The instructions also clarify the reporting requirement for LEAs and

02:59:43.600 --> 02:59:49.280
provide LEAs flexibility to refer to other planning documents to reduce duplication of effort.

02:59:53.440 --> 02:59:58.640
Regarding CDE capacity building and support the CDE will be hosting a Tuesdays at Two webinar

02:59:58.640 --> 03:00:04.080
series on Tuesday November 9th at 2 to provide training related to the one-time supplement to

03:00:04.080 --> 03:00:09.760
the annual update to the 21-22 LCAP and the related requirement to provide a report to the

03:00:09.760 --> 03:00:16.480
local governing border body of the local educational agency on or before February 28th of 2022.

03:00:17.040 --> 03:00:21.600
The CDE will hold regularly scheduled office hours throughout the spring of 2022 to support

03:00:21.600 --> 03:00:27.360
LEAs in development of the 22-23 LCAP and the CDE will continue to support LEAs by responding

03:00:27.360 --> 03:00:31.600
to questions received through the LCFF at CDE email account.

03:00:35.120 --> 03:00:41.200
So we just want to acknowledge that there are a lot of changes and this is a year of constant

03:00:41.200 --> 03:00:47.840
changes and we know that more changes are burdensome for all of our LEAs and so that is why we are very

03:00:47.840 --> 03:00:53.040
committed to leading a really strong technical assistance period after board action today.

03:00:53.040 --> 03:00:59.440
To start we have 11 scheduled webinars between November 9th and January 18th with more to come

03:00:59.440 --> 03:01:06.400
based on LEA and the field needs and requests. We will continue to add more Tuesdays at Two

03:01:06.400 --> 03:01:11.360
in response and we also thank our partners especially CECESA who generously invite us

03:01:11.360 --> 03:01:17.040
in to listen, present, calibrate, and collaborate with our county office of education partners

03:01:17.040 --> 03:01:21.920
and we will also be continuing to present updates to state and federal program directors meetings,

03:01:21.920 --> 03:01:28.880
the bilingual coordinators network just to name a few. Also LASSO will continue to offer office hours

03:01:28.880 --> 03:01:34.480
and we are very excited to announce that in the LASSO team we are adding one additional consultant

03:01:34.480 --> 03:01:41.360
to help support all of you in the field and also we are working on releasing the guidance

03:01:41.360 --> 03:01:46.320
documents created in collaboration with the Region 15 Comprehensive Center at West Ed.

03:01:46.320 --> 03:01:51.280
These sections specifically will focus on well-written LCAP sections and will be inclusive

03:01:51.280 --> 03:01:58.320
of all new requirements. We will also have guidance on how to use local more than state data as metrics

03:01:58.320 --> 03:02:03.840
in the LCAP and also support in timely posting of additional guidance documents to accompany

03:02:03.840 --> 03:02:12.640
our Tuesday at Two webinar series. So many more things to come and with that I will pause and

03:02:12.640 --> 03:02:14.560
turn it back over to you President Darling-Hammond.

03:02:18.480 --> 03:02:26.160
Thank you very much for that very thorough report. We really appreciate it. I was myself

03:02:26.160 --> 03:02:31.840
particularly excited about the dozen suggestions you have for streamlining already

03:02:31.840 --> 03:02:39.280
lining up. I want to ask that we have the public comment slide up and I want to

03:02:39.280 --> 03:02:46.400
begin to get the public comment queue going. Members of the public wishing to provide comment

03:02:46.400 --> 03:02:51.440
on this item can do so by calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the

03:02:51.440 --> 03:02:56.320
slide that is shown now and while we're waiting for members of the public to call in I want to

03:02:56.320 --> 03:03:01.760
ask Vice President Strauss and Member Burr as our accountability liaisons if they have any initial

03:03:01.760 --> 03:03:07.840
comments and then if we have any clarifying comments from board members we'll take those.

03:03:07.840 --> 03:03:15.360
We'll hold substantive discussion until after the public comment. So Vice President Strauss.

03:03:16.640 --> 03:03:22.160
So thank you President Darling-Hammond. So Lindsay and Josh thank you so much for a really clear

03:03:23.040 --> 03:03:29.520
succinct presentation really outlining all the changes that are happening and why we need to do

03:03:29.520 --> 03:03:37.280
it and also what lies ahead. I just so appreciate feedback from our local LEA saying wait till the

03:03:37.280 --> 03:03:43.040
next three year cycle don't change it in the middle now but that our LEAs are already suggesting

03:03:43.040 --> 03:03:49.440
and requesting things like charts and explanations and guidance. So I think the feedback for local

03:03:49.440 --> 03:03:57.440
LEAs continue to make this process better and we understand that the items today that are changes

03:03:57.440 --> 03:04:02.640
are required from new statutory language with the new carryover requirements and that there

03:04:02.720 --> 03:04:08.880
reflects a compromise that's taken shape over the last couple years. Secondly that the change the

03:04:08.880 --> 03:04:16.400
template that we're considering focuses on the actions and services that increase and improve

03:04:16.400 --> 03:04:21.680
services for students from low-income families English learners and foster youth. This will

03:04:21.680 --> 03:04:26.720
really help LEAs realize one of the fundamental goals of the local control funding formula

03:04:26.800 --> 03:04:33.520
and I just appreciate again that the feedback from the local LEAs is supporting these recommendations

03:04:33.520 --> 03:04:38.400
and again I look forward to the continued streamline efforts that President Darling-Hammond

03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:43.680
talked about and the changes in the next three year cycle because I think we all realize that

03:04:43.680 --> 03:04:49.120
while we've improved the template and the questions and the prompts it has gotten too long and there's

03:04:49.120 --> 03:04:54.240
a lot of redundancies. So I would support your plans and Lindsay I know you said you have several

03:04:54.240 --> 03:04:58.400
steps already planned and I know we're looking forward to that. So with that I'll turn it over

03:04:58.400 --> 03:05:05.440
to Member Burr. Thank you. Thank you Eileen. So I'll just associate myself with Eileen's

03:05:05.440 --> 03:05:11.920
gratitude and appreciation. It's so clear the level of solicitation of feedback that you've

03:05:11.920 --> 03:05:17.840
taken from all of our educational partners on what is not an easy task by any sense of the word.

03:05:18.480 --> 03:05:25.520
I just I do want to ask one clarifying question to either Lindsay or Josh just so that we know

03:05:25.520 --> 03:05:32.720
what's on the agenda for LEAs going forward. As I understand what's being proposed here

03:05:32.720 --> 03:05:42.720
there will be a supplement that's required for years 2020 and 2021 and that that has

03:05:42.720 --> 03:05:50.560
I'm sorry 2021-22 and that has to be completed by February 28th of 22. Just want to clarify that

03:05:50.560 --> 03:05:57.680
and the second thing is the revision of the current template and that is for the 2022-23

03:05:57.680 --> 03:06:03.200
school year so that any proposed changes wouldn't happen until after that. So if you could just

03:06:03.200 --> 03:06:10.320
clarify kind of the timing and people can have a sense of what the scope of work will be before

03:06:10.320 --> 03:06:18.160
LEAs if we adopt this item. I would appreciate that. Sure so the thank you for that question

03:06:18.160 --> 03:06:26.320
clarifying question Member Burr. So for the February 28th 2022 requirement LEAs must complete

03:06:26.320 --> 03:06:33.040
the one-time supplement to the annual update to the 21-22 LCAP. This is a template and it is

03:06:33.040 --> 03:06:40.000
attachment six. This template once adopted by the board anticipated today will be posted on the CDE

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:46.240
website and our Tuesday at 2 this coming Tuesday on November 9th will walk LEAs through that final

03:06:46.240 --> 03:06:52.560
template and the requirements for that presentation to their board. Another important note about this

03:06:52.560 --> 03:06:58.480
one-time supplement is that it does not need to be submitted after February 28th. It will be included

03:06:58.480 --> 03:07:05.040
in the 22-23 LCAP for the typical review and approval cycle when that happens this summer.

03:07:05.680 --> 03:07:12.400
Regarding the LCAP template update and revisions that is attachment five and all of those

03:07:12.400 --> 03:07:18.320
anticipated revisions once approved today will be posted and prepared and those revisions will be

03:07:18.320 --> 03:07:26.640
implemented as LEAs complete their 2022-23 LCAP. Does that clarify your question Member Burr?

03:07:26.640 --> 03:07:33.280
And just and when is the 22-23 LCAP just for everybody's edification when does that have

03:07:33.280 --> 03:07:43.760
to be completed? Completed oh by by it must be reviewed and adopted by July 1st of 2022.

03:07:44.800 --> 03:07:45.760
Okay thank you.

03:07:48.960 --> 03:07:55.200
All right I do not see any hands raised for further clarification at this time

03:07:56.160 --> 03:08:02.960
and I do know that we have 15 or more callers in the queue so I think maybe we'll go to public

03:08:03.040 --> 03:08:08.400
comment and then we'll come back for board discussion and further questions that board

03:08:08.400 --> 03:08:16.880
members may have. That's correct we do have 15 callers for item five. Caller please state

03:08:16.880 --> 03:08:20.160
your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:08:23.760 --> 03:08:28.880
SBE members my name is Michael Juba and I'm a classroom teacher representing the California

03:08:28.880 --> 03:08:35.840
Teachers Association. CTA is part of a coalition of labor and education management organizations

03:08:35.840 --> 03:08:41.840
that submitted a letter on the LCAP template. We urge the board to consider the recommendations

03:08:41.840 --> 03:08:47.840
outlined in the coalition letter and reinforce that the LCAP should be a strategic planning

03:08:47.840 --> 03:08:52.960
document. Any efforts to further evolve the LCAP into a compliance document

03:08:53.760 --> 03:08:59.680
disregarded. We appreciate that the template provides examples on how LEAs can increase

03:08:59.680 --> 03:09:04.880
or improve services for unduplicated students either qualitatively or quantitatively.

03:09:05.520 --> 03:09:09.360
We also urge the board to simplify the template as much as possible

03:09:09.920 --> 03:09:17.280
and not include additional requirements beyond the current law. 2021-22 school year well underway

03:09:17.280 --> 03:09:22.320
the pandemic continues to place substantial stress on students families teachers and

03:09:22.320 --> 03:09:29.520
administrators. Thank you. Thank you caller. Next caller please state your name and affiliation

03:09:29.520 --> 03:09:39.520
for the record. Your time starts now. Thank you for allowing my comments. I'm Pete Ahern president

03:09:39.520 --> 03:09:43.600
of the California Association of Science Educators. I want to thank President Darling

03:09:43.600 --> 03:09:47.520
Hammond in her opening comments today for highlighting the importance of the next generation

03:09:47.520 --> 03:09:52.240
science standards in helping educate California students about the science of climate change.

03:09:52.240 --> 03:09:56.880
However we have just released results of a statewide survey of teachers showing that NGSS

03:09:56.880 --> 03:10:01.040
implementation was never completed and has stalled. There are deep inequities in the

03:10:01.040 --> 03:10:06.160
implementation of NGSS. Most teachers do not yet have NGSS aligned instructional materials

03:10:06.160 --> 03:10:10.960
and have not had adequate professional learning to address the needs of consistently low performing

03:10:10.960 --> 03:10:15.760
student subgroups. What does this have to do with the LCAP template? Since districts set LCAP

03:10:15.760 --> 03:10:20.880
priorities based on the dashboard and science isn't on the dashboard NGSS implementation gets

03:10:20.880 --> 03:10:25.600
ignored. The LCAP template is a three-year plan but districts won't be seeing CAS results on the

03:10:25.600 --> 03:10:31.040
dashboard until 2023 which means they won't plan for science. As currently formatted the template

03:10:31.040 --> 03:10:36.800
does not adequately support the implementation of NGSS. We would suggest that we could have an icon

03:10:36.800 --> 03:10:41.920
on the dashboard that says CAS results coming in 2023. This would indicate the district that

03:10:41.920 --> 03:10:49.040
they need to support NGSS. Next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:10:49.040 --> 03:10:58.240
Your time starts now. Good morning Carlos Machado with the California School Boards Association.

03:10:58.240 --> 03:11:03.920
We support the templates uh templates proposed for adoption today. These templates balance the

03:11:03.920 --> 03:11:11.360
new statutory requirements with valid concerns about how the already lengthy LCAP is received

03:11:11.360 --> 03:11:17.200
locally. Approving the templates will help ensure these documents continue to be useful

03:11:17.920 --> 03:11:23.200
to our school communities and spur involvement by local educational partners in their development.

03:11:23.200 --> 03:11:27.040
We thank the board and its staff for their work on these templates and ask the board to

03:11:27.040 --> 03:11:32.960
approve the templates as drafted. Thank you. Thank you caller. Next caller please state your

03:11:32.960 --> 03:11:42.240
name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now. Good morning LeAngela Reed on behalf

03:11:42.240 --> 03:11:47.200
of the Small School Districts Association. Thank you Dr. Downingham and members of the board for

03:11:47.200 --> 03:11:54.640
hearing our testimony. SSDA supports the revised LCAP and one-time supplement. I want to thank

03:11:54.640 --> 03:11:59.920
the staff for their interaction with us for hearing our concerns and and for meeting in

03:11:59.920 --> 03:12:05.920
attempting to to you know help us to make us be part of the process. We also want to thank you

03:12:05.920 --> 03:12:10.880
and the other state board members for your ongoing recognition of the difficulties and uncertainties

03:12:10.880 --> 03:12:16.400
schools and districts continue to face. Our districts our small districts face difficulties

03:12:16.400 --> 03:12:21.200
that while not unique are certainly amplified. Our staffing shortages are more severe because

03:12:21.200 --> 03:12:25.520
it can be difficult to recruit in our areas. Our attendance and enrollment fluctuations are more

03:12:25.520 --> 03:12:30.800
pronounced because of our small numbers and that confounds our ability to plan appropriately.

03:12:30.800 --> 03:12:35.680
I say this not to complain but to give you to illustrate our environment however we are

03:12:35.680 --> 03:12:40.720
committed to the accountability system created and believe in it. We are integral parts of our

03:12:40.720 --> 03:12:45.040
communities and with generations attending the same school. We don't just know our students.

03:12:45.040 --> 03:12:51.040
Thank you. We know their families. Thank you caller. Your time's up. Next caller please state

03:12:51.040 --> 03:12:55.040
your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:12:58.560 --> 03:13:03.360
Honorable state board members I am Sylvia Hodge assistant director at LMU Center for Equity for

03:13:03.360 --> 03:13:08.080
English learners. I offer these comments to advocate for changes to the measuring and reporting

03:13:08.080 --> 03:13:13.920
results section of the LCAP template. Currently LEAs are encouraged to identify metrics for specific

03:13:13.920 --> 03:13:19.520
student subgroups to narrow gap. Instead language should be amended to state LEAs should identify

03:13:19.520 --> 03:13:24.240
metrics for specific student subgroups. Three previous studies by the center reflected that

03:13:24.240 --> 03:13:29.600
district LCAP exhibited minimal mention of metrics and analysis of English learner outcomes.

03:13:29.600 --> 03:13:33.840
We are currently conducting an additional study with a sample of statewide district LCAP.

03:13:33.840 --> 03:13:39.120
Unfortunately preliminary findings reflect similar trends in the absence of identifying metrics

03:13:39.120 --> 03:13:45.360
and analysis to support English learners. A 2021 brief case research partnership study showed that

03:13:45.360 --> 03:13:50.080
English learners were the student group most affected by the pandemic. Therefore we recommend

03:13:50.080 --> 03:13:56.560
that the state board of education require that specific metrics for English learners be included

03:13:56.560 --> 03:14:01.280
in the LCAP template to support this vulnerable student subgroup. Thank you for your time.

03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:06.640
Thank you caller. Next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:14:06.640 --> 03:14:08.080
Your time starts now.

03:14:08.080 --> 03:14:17.200
Good morning Andrea Ball on behalf of two groups. First the Central Valley Education Coalition.

03:14:17.840 --> 03:14:24.640
Over 100 LEAs serving over 400,000 pupils and the California Association of Suburban School

03:14:24.640 --> 03:14:29.840
Districts. Large districts across the state support the recommendations of the CDE,

03:14:30.400 --> 03:14:35.200
request the state board adopt these revisions to the LCAP template and the one-time supplement.

03:14:35.840 --> 03:14:41.520
We are firmly in support of the LCAP and the accountability system and think these proposed

03:14:41.520 --> 03:14:48.720
changes will do much to balance out the statutory requirements and as well as allow these to be

03:14:48.720 --> 03:14:54.800
meaningful documents for the community. Thank you. Thank you caller. Next caller please state

03:14:54.800 --> 03:14:58.160
your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:14:58.160 --> 03:15:04.720
Honorable board members,

03:15:04.720 --> 03:15:10.960
Shelly Spiegel-Coleman, California Together. We urge you to revisit the language and expectation

03:15:10.960 --> 03:15:16.080
for inclusion of metrics and growth targets to establish goals to close achievement gaps

03:15:16.080 --> 03:15:22.720
beyond DA districts and CSI school. Reflecting on Superintendent Slurman's comments today about

03:15:22.720 --> 03:15:27.600
closing gaps and board member Rucker's comments about language to set expectations,

03:15:28.160 --> 03:15:33.760
we call your attention to page 25 of attachment 5. The language under measuring and reporting

03:15:33.760 --> 03:15:39.520
results only encourages districts to set metrics that would close gaps. We believe the equity

03:15:39.520 --> 03:15:45.920
attempts of LCFF allows us at least to suggest that districts should set these targets. At the

03:15:45.920 --> 03:15:51.440
September board meeting several of you expressed the need to name student subgroups, research-based

03:15:51.440 --> 03:15:56.880
standards-aligned practices. Reading LCAP with the Center for Equity for English Learner for

03:15:56.880 --> 03:16:02.480
four years, this is an area that needs direction, not just encouragement. Please vote to change the

03:16:02.480 --> 03:16:09.120
word encourage to should in the template. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller please state your

03:16:09.120 --> 03:16:20.480
name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now. My name is Lexi Lopez from EdVoice.

03:16:21.040 --> 03:16:26.320
We along with the Alliance for Students remain very concerned that beyond the calculation itself,

03:16:26.320 --> 03:16:32.160
the proposed template is vague with respect to what LEAs must report on specific expenditures

03:16:32.160 --> 03:16:38.720
and actions supported with unspent carryover funding in an ensuing year. EdVoice urges the

03:16:38.720 --> 03:16:44.320
board to direct CDE staff to develop explicit instructions with examples in the template that

03:16:44.320 --> 03:16:51.840
aligns with AB 130 to ensure unused LCFF carryover funds are additive and expended to benefit

03:16:51.840 --> 03:16:58.320
targeted students. In addition, EdVoice recommends that the board ensure districts report by school

03:16:58.320 --> 03:17:04.880
the staff positions supported by the 1.1 billion in targeted additional concentration grant funding

03:17:04.880 --> 03:17:10.240
to ensure staffing levels at schools with a higher concentration of unduplicated students have

03:17:10.240 --> 03:17:16.240
improved. Thank you. Thank you caller. Next caller please state your name and affiliation

03:17:16.240 --> 03:17:24.400
for the record. Your time starts now. Sarah Botches at the California Association of School Business

03:17:24.400 --> 03:17:29.120
Officials in support of the template proposed for adoption today. We're very appreciative of the

03:17:29.120 --> 03:17:34.720
support of the staff as well as the state board members. Thank you for hearing us out. We've we're

03:17:34.800 --> 03:17:41.360
very appreciative of the conversation taking place today. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller,

03:17:50.400 --> 03:17:55.200
Hello, Leimani Aguinaldo on behalf of the Association of California School Administrators

03:17:55.200 --> 03:18:00.560
and our organization supports the draft templates as proposed. In light of the challenges faced by

03:18:00.560 --> 03:18:05.680
LEAs at this time, we appreciate the attention paid to streamlining the templates and ensuring

03:18:05.680 --> 03:18:10.720
that changes included in the template reflect statutory requirements and nothing more. The

03:18:10.720 --> 03:18:16.480
template as drafted is consistent with existing particularly with the requirements to demonstrate

03:18:16.480 --> 03:18:21.840
increased or improved services for unduplicated students. We have additional points in our accent

03:18:21.840 --> 03:18:27.600
letter as well as a coalition letter that we submitted for this item. Thank you. Thank you.

03:18:28.320 --> 03:18:33.440
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:18:37.360 --> 03:18:41.920
Good morning. This is Sarah Lilas, Executive Director of Teach Plus California. We first want

03:18:41.920 --> 03:18:46.000
to associate our comments with a letter sent by both the LCFS Equity Coalition and the Alliance

03:18:46.000 --> 03:18:51.440
for Students. In particular, we appreciate staff's revision to add the carryover dollar figure to

03:18:51.440 --> 03:18:56.720
increase or improve services and the recommendation that if any qualitative percentages are used that

03:18:56.720 --> 03:19:02.080
LEAs justify how that percentage corresponds to the amount of SNC allocation it's covering.

03:19:02.080 --> 03:19:07.040
We would recommend that the template go one step further to identify any planned actions or services

03:19:07.040 --> 03:19:11.920
which are being supported by the carryover funds. More broadly, our Teach Plus teacher leaders want

03:19:11.920 --> 03:19:16.640
to again elevate that their hope for LCFS to address educational inequity was rooted not

03:19:16.640 --> 03:19:21.360
only in directing additional resources to students who've been underserved but in the promise of

03:19:21.360 --> 03:19:25.840
community engagement and accountability to ensure local leaders are truly meeting the needs of their

03:19:25.840 --> 03:19:30.080
communities and the LCAP and how it is used is essential in doing that. We look forward to

03:19:30.080 --> 03:19:34.240
working with you and ensuring that it's both a tool for planning as well as transparency and

03:19:34.240 --> 03:19:40.320
accountability. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the

03:19:40.320 --> 03:19:48.800
record. Your time starts now. Hello, it's Eric Premack with the Charter Schools Development Center.

03:19:48.800 --> 03:19:54.720
We too are in support of approval of the template as proposed and thank CDE for their hard work and

03:19:54.720 --> 03:20:00.560
outreach. We are though very much concerned that the template has grown to the point where it's

03:20:00.560 --> 03:20:07.920
largely incomprehensible to school staff and especially to parents and other education partners

03:20:08.480 --> 03:20:14.320
and we really strongly in the strongest possible terms urge the state board to lean on Governor

03:20:14.320 --> 03:20:21.440
Newsom, state superintendent Thurmond and especially the legislature to fundamentally rethink the

03:20:21.440 --> 03:20:27.680
length and scope of the LCAP and turn it into something that is much more practical

03:20:27.680 --> 03:20:33.920
and comprehensible. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

03:20:33.920 --> 03:20:42.560
for the record. Your time starts now. Good afternoon, Colleen Pagter on behalf of Los Angeles

03:20:42.560 --> 03:20:47.120
Unified School District. LA Unified supports the new templates and feels that they balance the

03:20:47.120 --> 03:20:52.480
statutory requirements for changes to the LCAP template, the challenges that LEAs are facing

03:20:52.480 --> 03:20:57.680
today. With that in mind, we ask that CDE and the state board develop and circulate resources to help

03:20:57.680 --> 03:21:03.840
LEAs and our communities with understanding these changes. Updating the FAQ page on the CDE website

03:21:03.840 --> 03:21:08.480
and creating a toolkit for LEAs with materials that can be shared with our families and partners

03:21:08.480 --> 03:21:13.600
would be very helpful in ensuring consistency and understanding of this revised LCAP. Again,

03:21:13.600 --> 03:21:17.840
we appreciate the work of CDE and the state board and support the final draft. However,

03:21:17.840 --> 03:21:22.640
we also want to urge that more work be done to help streamline and shorten the LCAP to make it

03:21:22.640 --> 03:21:28.720
more accessible and transparent for our communities. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please state

03:21:28.720 --> 03:21:36.960
your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now. Hi, Leticia Garcia on behalf of

03:21:36.960 --> 03:21:42.160
the Riverside County Superintendent of Schools. We're part of a coalition of LEAs and education

03:21:42.160 --> 03:21:46.880
organizations in support of the proposed revisions. Notwithstanding our support,

03:21:46.880 --> 03:21:51.440
we offer additional input. Our districts embrace accountability for student outcomes,

03:21:51.440 --> 03:21:56.160
but they also need flexibility to meet their obligations, especially now with a windfall of

03:21:56.160 --> 03:22:02.240
one-time COVID funds with expiration dates that LEAs are spending as quickly and wisely as local

03:22:02.240 --> 03:22:07.360
capacity allows. The proposed template only allows for LEAs to receive credit for their

03:22:07.360 --> 03:22:13.200
proportionality obligation if they increase services by funding in action with LCFF funds

03:22:13.200 --> 03:22:18.720
or improve services by including actions without funds, but not in action funded with other

03:22:18.720 --> 03:22:24.000
sources. We believe districts should get credit when they blend funding. Lastly, we agree the

03:22:24.000 --> 03:22:29.360
template has become too complicated and support efforts to streamline the template while folding

03:22:29.360 --> 03:22:35.200
LEAs accountable. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

03:22:35.200 --> 03:22:44.800
for the record. Your time starts now. Hello, Madam President. This is Brian Rebus calling

03:22:44.800 --> 03:22:51.440
on behalf of the Education Trust West. We agree with our partners in the equity coalition regarding

03:22:51.440 --> 03:22:57.920
the specifics, but I wanted to offer a high level comment. For those of you who may be wondering,

03:22:57.920 --> 03:23:05.040
how did we get here? We think the problems with LCFF transparency are rooted in some administrative

03:23:05.200 --> 03:23:10.640
policy decisions regarding the lack of a standardized account code for supplemental and

03:23:10.640 --> 03:23:18.000
concentration dollars and some decisions related to per-pupil reporting, per-pupil expenditures

03:23:18.000 --> 03:23:26.080
reporting under federal law. That's resulted in researchers and the state auditor finding that we

03:23:26.080 --> 03:23:33.440
really don't know what's happening to LCFF dollars intended for unduplicated students and we think

03:23:33.440 --> 03:23:39.600
that's a big problem going forward. When the governor and the legislature talk about LCFF,

03:23:39.600 --> 03:23:44.640
they immediately talk about the amount of funding going into supplemental and concentration.

03:23:44.640 --> 03:23:49.440
The general public thinks those dollars are being spent and that we know where they're going.

03:23:51.200 --> 03:23:55.920
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:23:55.920 --> 03:24:04.960
Good afternoon. This is Liz Guillen, public advocate for the LCFF equity coalition.

03:24:05.760 --> 03:24:11.120
Want to repeat from our comments our many thanks to the department for an open revision process

03:24:11.120 --> 03:24:15.680
and the opportunities for weighing in and most importantly for hearing us and acting on our

03:24:15.680 --> 03:24:20.240
comments where they have. We appreciate the department's emphasis, the fact that got us

03:24:20.240 --> 03:24:25.600
here today. That is LEAs not meeting their equity obligations. The student advisory board

03:24:25.600 --> 03:24:30.880
comments this morning echo the voices of many marginalized students who deserve more, not the

03:24:30.880 --> 03:24:38.160
same resources. We support revisions, in particular today's recommendation by the department to provide

03:24:38.160 --> 03:24:48.320
the projected percentage to increase or improve services for the carryover and that we want to

03:24:48.320 --> 03:24:55.280
keep pushing on the importance of identifying in the action section which actions are being

03:24:55.280 --> 03:25:02.320
supported by carryover funds. That is not too much to ask. It takes merely an asterisk to note that

03:25:02.320 --> 03:25:09.600
this action is being supported by funds that were unspent. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller,

03:25:09.600 --> 03:25:13.440
please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:25:13.440 --> 03:25:21.760
Hi, this is Robert from children now. I want to associate myself with the comments of the

03:25:21.760 --> 03:25:26.880
LCFF equity coalition and the alliance for student success and focus my comments on one

03:25:26.880 --> 03:25:31.680
specific issue. But first I wanted to highlight the findings of the public policy through the

03:25:31.680 --> 03:25:38.880
California study that shows that only 55% of dollars distributed through supplemental

03:25:38.880 --> 03:25:43.840
concentration grants actually get to the school sites where the kids are that generated those

03:25:43.840 --> 03:25:50.720
funds. We have concerns with that general finding and steps like the carryover provisions are one

03:25:50.720 --> 03:25:54.960
small step in improving that process. We think there are many more that need to be done.

03:25:56.000 --> 03:26:02.960
In terms of the template itself, we want to focus on the 1.1 billion that's available for

03:26:02.960 --> 03:26:09.760
staff at high concentration schools. AB 130, the authorizing legislation for this,

03:26:09.760 --> 03:26:15.200
focuses on the LCAP being the enforcement tool for ensuring those dollars get to those school sites.

03:26:15.200 --> 03:26:19.760
We don't believe that there's sufficient information in this template to ensure that

03:26:19.760 --> 03:26:24.320
the dollars are getting to the school sites and the additional staff is being either hired

03:26:24.320 --> 03:26:30.560
or transferred to those schools. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the

03:26:30.560 --> 03:26:42.800
record. Your time starts now. Hello, it's John Affeld from Public Advocates. I want to

03:26:44.160 --> 03:26:51.040
appreciate all the work the department and the state board staff have done. I think in terms of

03:26:53.280 --> 03:26:59.680
instructions in the template, it honors the original statute that allows for proportional

03:26:59.680 --> 03:27:06.240
increases or proportional improvements directed toward high need students.

03:27:08.080 --> 03:27:14.080
It's been our experience over the last eight years that quality improvements, while they may exist,

03:27:15.200 --> 03:27:21.920
are the exception rather than the rule and I think that will continue to be the case

03:27:21.920 --> 03:27:27.760
as we move forward. It is important though that any qualitative improvement percentages be

03:27:29.840 --> 03:27:37.040
demonstrated to correspond to the supplemental concentration dollar allocation amount.

03:27:37.760 --> 03:27:42.960
That's what the statute calls for and AB 130 reinforced.

03:27:45.920 --> 03:27:50.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:27:50.640 --> 03:28:01.200
Hello, honorable board members. My name is Melissa Elder with the Rincon Indian Education Center

03:28:01.200 --> 03:28:07.040
located on the Rincon reservation in what is now known as San Diego County. I would like to reiterate

03:28:07.040 --> 03:28:11.440
comments that were made today and during the last board meeting discussion about

03:28:11.440 --> 03:28:16.480
broadening what is considered as subgroups to include Native American students and additionally,

03:28:16.480 --> 03:28:21.600
students should be setting specific goals, not simply encouraged to do so. We know Native

03:28:21.600 --> 03:28:25.760
youth are not performing as well as their counterparts. They have lower graduation rates

03:28:25.760 --> 03:28:31.680
due to being pushed out of school through excessive suspension and funneled into the

03:28:31.680 --> 03:28:37.280
adult criminal system. As stated in the education codes, Indian children have not succeeded well in

03:28:37.280 --> 03:28:42.320
California public schools and we're still seeing them being left out and our school districts leaving

03:28:42.320 --> 03:28:46.720
out Indian education centers from meaningful planning processes and necessary in school

03:28:46.720 --> 03:28:52.640
programming as educational partners. Native American and American Indian students have unique

03:28:52.640 --> 03:28:58.400
situations and specific needs and in order to address those needs they need to be specific goals

03:28:59.120 --> 03:29:00.480
to address those. Thank you.

03:29:04.720 --> 03:29:09.360

03:29:42.720 --> 03:29:50.800
coalition letter. We also support CDE staff recommendation, their additional revision

03:29:51.360 --> 03:29:57.200
regarding the increased or improved services section of the template to include the dollar

03:29:57.200 --> 03:30:04.960
amount associated with the LCFS carryover in addition to the percentage. We would like to

03:30:04.960 --> 03:30:11.760
make sure that if any qualitative percentages are used those percentages need to correspond

03:30:11.760 --> 03:30:19.440
to the amount of the SNC allocation and discovery. Lastly, we also associate ourselves with the

03:30:19.440 --> 03:30:28.480
comments made by representatives of the Californians together regarding the specific EL information on

03:30:28.480 --> 03:30:35.760
the LCAP template. It is requested that the board clearly include. Thank you caller.

03:30:39.760 --> 03:30:41.520
Thank you caller. Your time's up.

03:30:48.960 --> 03:30:53.120
This concludes public comment for item number five.

03:30:53.840 --> 03:30:59.040
Thank you very much. I want to appreciate all of the callers who've called in and their comments

03:30:59.040 --> 03:31:06.720
and the work of the staff on this complicated and important item. And I want to open this to

03:31:07.440 --> 03:31:09.040
board commentary.

03:31:13.760 --> 03:31:16.160
I see member Glover Woods.

03:31:16.160 --> 03:31:24.240
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond. Just to echo your thanks to CDE staff for really working with

03:31:25.520 --> 03:31:32.160
wide diversity of educational partners to really try to have a template that

03:31:33.520 --> 03:31:38.720
addresses the statutory requirements and the concerns that that statute was addressing.

03:31:38.720 --> 03:31:45.760
That addresses the statutory requirements and the concerns that that statute was addressing.

03:31:46.480 --> 03:31:54.080
It was definitely not an easy job to do. And I think based upon the comments that we've received

03:31:54.080 --> 03:32:00.480
in writing and during public comment, many of our educational partners do feel heard

03:32:00.480 --> 03:32:06.160
and are appreciative of the revisions that were made for both the template for the LCAP as well

03:32:06.160 --> 03:32:13.520
as the supplement. I just want to again say that as we move forward, I appreciate that the

03:32:13.520 --> 03:32:19.600
streamlining of the LCAP template will be front of mind if you will. Definitely think it is

03:32:20.240 --> 03:32:26.960
important to wait for the next cycle to just allow for LEAs to get used to the template that they

03:32:26.960 --> 03:32:33.840
have in front of them. One piece just to as we keep in mind and as we go forward with streamlining,

03:32:34.800 --> 03:32:42.560
just to remember that it is essential that all educational partners understand what's in the

03:32:42.560 --> 03:32:51.360
LCAP. So the more complex it becomes, the more likelihood we have of disenfranchising some of

03:32:51.360 --> 03:32:59.280
the educational partners. And of course we want for time to really be spent on implementing the

03:32:59.360 --> 03:33:05.200
goals, actions, and services that are in the LCAP template, not completing the template itself.

03:33:05.760 --> 03:33:11.920
So I do look forward to the upcoming actions in relation to the streamlining. And again,

03:33:11.920 --> 03:33:20.240
thank you so much to the CDE staff for just a phenomenal job in implementing the revisions

03:33:20.240 --> 03:33:28.880
that were necessary to the LCAP template. Thank you, Al. Move to Member Sun and then

03:33:28.880 --> 03:33:35.360
Member Burr. Thank you. I appreciate Board Member Gloverwood's comments, you know,

03:33:35.920 --> 03:33:41.920
echo those absolutely. And I think I've mentioned this in the past, but I think we are beyond

03:33:42.800 --> 03:33:51.200
paper for this LCAP. And I would really encourage as we are looking forward to the evolution,

03:33:51.200 --> 03:33:56.560
continued evolution of this LCAP, that we look at another means to display it other than through

03:33:56.560 --> 03:34:03.520
a paper system that it could be either web-based in some way because of the complexity and the

03:34:03.520 --> 03:34:14.880
layers and trying to relate goals to the budget and all of that. It just seems like a 2D paper

03:34:14.880 --> 03:34:20.000
format that we've been using is just not effective and it's not understandable,

03:34:20.960 --> 03:34:26.240
as has been mentioned already several times. So I would just encourage us to look at new

03:34:26.240 --> 03:34:32.160
ways of how we might display the LCAP in a more futuristic way rather than the paper

03:34:32.160 --> 03:34:38.880
that we're using now. Thanks. Thank you. Member Burr and then Member Patio-Bronson.

03:34:40.640 --> 03:34:44.000
Thank you. I actually will defer to Member Patio-Bronson.

03:34:44.000 --> 03:34:47.920
I just wanted to make some closing comments before doing a motion.

03:34:47.920 --> 03:34:57.920
And I'm going to try and talk and if it gets too loud with the gardener in the background,

03:34:59.520 --> 03:35:07.840
maybe I'll continue later. So I also wanted to share in the chorus of appreciation,

03:35:07.840 --> 03:35:13.520
there's just been a tremendous amount of work and progress, I think, that has been made in,

03:35:14.480 --> 03:35:21.200
I think, relatively short time in terms of many of the amendments that have been coming both

03:35:21.200 --> 03:35:27.520
legislatively but also in conversation with so many of the partners from community, from the

03:35:27.520 --> 03:35:35.760
Equity Coalition, from the LEA community as well. I want to also offer a very clear appreciation

03:35:35.760 --> 03:35:42.720
for the inclusion and the instructions of language reflecting some of our legislative

03:35:42.720 --> 03:35:52.480
changes from this last cycle around TK-12 being named. I was reflecting back on my own time as

03:35:52.480 --> 03:35:59.040
an advocate working with local school districts and having had many conversations where school

03:35:59.040 --> 03:36:05.840
district leaders were not then familiar or confident that TK students, for example,

03:36:05.840 --> 03:36:13.280
generated ADA and should be included within LCAPs. So having that specifically called out,

03:36:13.280 --> 03:36:19.280
I think, is absolutely a step in the right direction of clarifying how much TK students

03:36:19.280 --> 03:36:23.600
are a part of the school community and should be a part of the strategic planning effort.

03:36:25.200 --> 03:36:33.920
I did want to ask, and this is I think a relatively small change, all of the references to TK-12 as

03:36:33.920 --> 03:36:42.000
applicable appear in the instructions as distinct from the template and it largely

03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:49.040
replaced or referred to previously to its students. The one place that I think that it could be

03:36:49.040 --> 03:36:56.960
frontlined in the actual template itself is really just on page one where there is language saying,

03:36:57.920 --> 03:37:06.240
describe the LEA, its school and its students, and if we could just add, comma, TK-12 as applicable.

03:37:06.240 --> 03:37:12.320
I think that would actually really make it clear for LEAs that this is part of the planning

03:37:12.320 --> 03:37:23.360
responsibilities just as much as any other grade. I also wanted to lift up, I think, that the table

03:37:23.360 --> 03:37:30.000
that has been included on carryover, I think, is also very much an improvement and it gets to

03:37:30.000 --> 03:37:35.920
this idea of what is going to clearly and transparently communicate to local community

03:37:35.920 --> 03:37:42.160
members, parents, and equity groups around what the carryover calculation looks like.

03:37:42.960 --> 03:37:48.000
I think many public comment folks have also suggested that there could be an accompanying

03:37:48.000 --> 03:37:57.280
table to say what are the planned actions for that carryover calculation. Again, to this idea

03:37:57.280 --> 03:38:05.280
of what makes it clear, what sort of, in the absence of going all not yet going completely

03:38:05.280 --> 03:38:11.920
virtual and having it on your phone or pop up as a hologram, however the technology might be next,

03:38:12.560 --> 03:38:17.360
tables communicate very succinctly and I think it's an easy fix.

03:38:18.640 --> 03:38:23.840
And then the last suggestion, which I also think was raised by several public commenters,

03:38:23.840 --> 03:38:30.720
the idea of moving from an encouraged goal for subgroups to something that is

03:38:31.920 --> 03:38:39.520
firmer in saying that they should in fact have goals. Certainly as a parent, I think the idea

03:38:39.520 --> 03:38:47.200
that if you know that there is a massive gap in terms of how children are faring, you would want

03:38:47.200 --> 03:38:53.680
your local LEA to have aspirations that are clear and specific and to see those in bright lines and

03:38:53.680 --> 03:39:03.200
clear text. Thank you very much. I'm going to go ahead and recognize member Rucker, member

03:39:03.680 --> 03:39:10.400
Bonanca and member Escobedo and then come back around to member Burr as I think you're

03:39:11.200 --> 03:39:19.600
holding out for the last spot there. So member Rucker. Thank you very much. When we had a

03:39:19.600 --> 03:39:27.200
conversation about the changes and recommendations at the previous board meeting, there were a lot of

03:39:27.200 --> 03:39:35.360
questions raised as to how the valuation and the explanation about how services would be

03:39:36.560 --> 03:39:43.280
reported and how expenditures would be shown. I mean it became a very complicated and at some

03:39:43.280 --> 03:39:50.000
point confusing discussion. So I do commend the department for the efforts they've made

03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:55.920
to address a lot of the concerns that I know my colleagues on the board raise and I know that I

03:39:55.920 --> 03:40:05.280
asked very explicitly about as a way of addressing. I remain concerned that while this is a reporting

03:40:05.280 --> 03:40:14.640
document, I remain concerned that the accountability that is in the title of this plan still is not

03:40:14.640 --> 03:40:22.560
evident or as apparent as it could be for the districts that will begin using this to develop

03:40:22.560 --> 03:40:30.240
the supplementary report that will be turned in in July. We heard from a number of stakeholders

03:40:30.240 --> 03:40:36.960
about the need to recognize student subgroups and as I sit here I am very aware

03:40:36.960 --> 03:40:43.200
that African-American students are the lowest performing subgroup in all of the subject areas

03:40:43.200 --> 03:40:50.640
that we currently test in every single subject, I mean in every single grade level and so I have

03:40:50.640 --> 03:40:58.320
that concern because we're not requiring as a factor or an element of accountability,

03:40:58.320 --> 03:41:04.800
there is no mandate to require districts to pay attention to their high need students. We give

03:41:05.440 --> 03:41:12.000
voice to or we give an expectation that they should be addressing these high need students

03:41:12.000 --> 03:41:18.240
yet we continue to see reports like an Ed source where only 55 cents of every dollar that's supposed

03:41:18.240 --> 03:41:24.080
to go to support these students is actually being spent at the schools where these students attend.

03:41:24.720 --> 03:41:31.360
So and in being careful to make that criticism, I'm not criticizing the efforts of schools as

03:41:31.360 --> 03:41:38.640
if to say this is not occurring, what I am saying is that if it's not evident in the accountability

03:41:38.640 --> 03:41:45.200
plan that we are paying attention to the most needy students by making absolute assertions

03:41:45.200 --> 03:41:50.800
not only about how the money is being spent but it's being spent on these students because they

03:41:50.800 --> 03:41:56.720
are the target, they are the reason why the sites and the districts receive these funds,

03:41:56.720 --> 03:42:04.560
then what is the school actually holding itself accountable for? So while the mandates in the

03:42:04.560 --> 03:42:12.160
statute can ask us to continue to revise and live with the question of what stating school improvement

03:42:12.160 --> 03:42:18.320
looks like and how to articulate that with our community of partners and with the engagement that

03:42:18.320 --> 03:42:24.880
creates consensus about where our priorities are, I want to remind you about the report we just heard

03:42:24.880 --> 03:42:31.840
from our student advisory committee. Student voice has done more to articulate some of the issues of

03:42:31.840 --> 03:42:37.840
concern that are directly related to what's being revised in this template and issues concerning

03:42:37.840 --> 03:42:43.280
diversity and addressing diversity in school planning but also in supporting students who

03:42:43.280 --> 03:42:49.440
are in low wealth or who come from low SES backgrounds. While it's not a requirement in

03:42:49.440 --> 03:42:55.520
the LCAP to address that, I just have to wonder if these are the students who are the reasons why

03:42:55.520 --> 03:43:04.320
districts are receiving an unprecedented $21,000 per pupil expenditure by the state from multiple

03:43:04.320 --> 03:43:10.240
resources, including from the federal government, why would it be so difficult to make plain in a

03:43:10.240 --> 03:43:16.640
chart, in a summary, or even in prioritized statements about these students what these funds

03:43:16.640 --> 03:43:23.440
are for? So while we have come a long way, the LCAP that will be created by the changes we will

03:43:23.440 --> 03:43:30.320
approve today is a significant improvement from where we started when the LCAP was implemented

03:43:30.320 --> 03:43:37.840
all those years ago. We still have a long way to go to help districts understand that they have,

03:43:37.840 --> 03:43:43.840
they are accountable for how they close the achievement gap and address the support

03:43:43.840 --> 03:43:50.400
constraints for the students that need to be targeted and identified as their highest need

03:43:50.400 --> 03:43:57.840
students. We still have not sufficiently closed the gap on how that should be addressed in these

03:43:57.840 --> 03:44:09.120
plans. I'm going to member Banaka. Thank you. Thank you. Well, first, I want to thank the CDA

03:44:09.120 --> 03:44:15.280
staff for such a comprehensive presentation, and I just wanted to echo some of the remarks of many

03:44:15.280 --> 03:44:20.960
other board members thus far in that I really appreciate the emphasis on clarity and conciseness

03:44:20.960 --> 03:44:26.720
in this template. I think that in general, the more clear and concise and understandable that

03:44:26.720 --> 03:44:31.840
we can make the LCAP template without sacrificing the intent or the purpose,

03:44:31.840 --> 03:44:37.280
the more educational partners are going to be willing and able to engage in the LCAP

03:44:37.280 --> 03:44:43.920
process and give their feedback. And especially for students who are generally newer to education

03:44:43.920 --> 03:44:50.640
policy, I think the LCAP can be extremely daunting, saying that it's a giant document

03:44:51.280 --> 03:44:56.960
full of a lot of complex terms. And I think that the more complex it gets, the more it deters

03:44:56.960 --> 03:45:01.440
students and scares them away from giving their valuable input. And I think that just generally

03:45:01.440 --> 03:45:07.280
takes away from the whole purpose of LCAP, which is to hear the local input, especially of students

03:45:07.280 --> 03:45:13.600
who are the primary educational partners. And just furthermore beyond that, I think this year,

03:45:13.600 --> 03:45:18.640
especially we're all a little burnt out because of the pandemic. So I think having a more streamlined

03:45:18.640 --> 03:45:24.000
template really helps to ease the weight on the shoulders of not only staff, but the educational

03:45:24.000 --> 03:45:31.280
partners. Moving forward, I think I'd like to see the LCAP represented in newer forms as stated by

03:45:31.280 --> 03:45:36.800
Member Sun, other than the paper template. And I think especially for students, this may be a bit

03:45:36.800 --> 03:45:42.480
easier to follow, because especially after this year, we're all very familiar with technology and

03:45:43.200 --> 03:45:47.760
viewing documents on our computers. And so that's something that's kind of, you know,

03:45:47.760 --> 03:45:53.600
right up our alley. But again, I really appreciate all of the great work that the CDE staff has done

03:45:53.600 --> 03:45:59.120
in listening to the educational partners and really trying to streamline this template as much as

03:45:59.120 --> 03:46:07.920
possible. Terrific. Thank you. Member Escobedo, then Member McCullin. Yes, I'm not going to repeat

03:46:07.920 --> 03:46:16.320
what my amazing colleagues, especially Ms. Rucker, Trustee Rucker, highlighted the importance of

03:46:16.320 --> 03:46:22.400
having stronger language, but also I would like to add, yes, it's great that we're looking at

03:46:22.400 --> 03:46:29.280
streamlining the process, but I think just as important is that coherence of effort, right?

03:46:30.080 --> 03:46:38.000
We heard Superintendent Thurmond talk about literacy by third grade, enhancing the educational

03:46:38.000 --> 03:46:43.920
environment, learning environment for African Americans. So there's any way to have, yes,

03:46:43.920 --> 03:46:51.680
that local input, but at the same time, that coherence with the state. Not sure how we can

03:46:51.680 --> 03:46:59.840
do this in the LCAP, but I think coherence is exceedingly important for all systems to work

03:46:59.840 --> 03:47:06.400
together and to see California as a whole to move forward in the area of accountability.

03:47:06.400 --> 03:47:14.960
Thank you. Member McCullin. Yes, I'll be brief. I know it's lunchtime now, but

03:47:16.400 --> 03:47:22.560
I want to thank the staff at CDE for all the work on this, also monumental, but I agree with

03:47:23.600 --> 03:47:30.400
Member Rucker's statements that we still have a ways to go in ensuring that this plan

03:47:31.360 --> 03:47:37.680
covers the students that most need it, you know, those groups and using language that the goals

03:47:38.720 --> 03:47:43.520
should be set, should, shall be set on those students who are in most need.

03:47:44.880 --> 03:47:51.440
I also want to say thank you for listening to the educational partners, such as the

03:47:51.440 --> 03:47:57.200
tribal organizations that wanted to move away from a certain language in the instructions and in the

03:47:57.200 --> 03:48:03.120
document and moving towards calling those partners, educational partners that we are,

03:48:03.120 --> 03:48:10.080
so I appreciate that move. Words do matter. So thank you and thank you for all the efforts.

03:48:10.080 --> 03:48:16.880
And then all the help sessions, the Tuesday, Tuesday at two help sessions, I appreciate that.

03:48:16.880 --> 03:48:23.200
I know districts want to have as much access as possible to for additional help, technical

03:48:23.200 --> 03:48:32.080
assistance, so thank you. Member Rodriguez. Yes, thank you and I won't repeat everything

03:48:32.080 --> 03:48:38.800
that's been said, but I do want to thank staff for incorporating our educational partners

03:48:38.800 --> 03:48:44.720
feedback. I think that's incredibly important and also for the transition to educational partners.

03:48:45.760 --> 03:48:51.920
I was left with a question about the NGSS and if that is, if there's a way to,

03:48:52.560 --> 03:48:58.240
from one of the callers who mentioned that, and if there's a way to incorporate that, if,

03:48:58.240 --> 03:49:04.480
like he said, it's just a checkbox, so is it possible to do that? And also member Rutgers

03:49:05.120 --> 03:49:11.680
comments about, you know, the ensuring that we have specific information and

03:49:12.720 --> 03:49:16.480
holding our educational partners accountable. Thank you.

03:49:16.480 --> 03:49:25.840
Thank you and as I pass the ball to member Burr, I just want to associate myself with the comments

03:49:25.840 --> 03:49:32.960
that have been made about how important it is to be strong in our expectations that students who

03:49:32.960 --> 03:49:38.720
have the greatest needs should be attended to in the discussion in the LCAP about the allocation

03:49:38.720 --> 03:49:48.240
of funds and so I want to be sure that there's a clear concern communicated about that ongoing

03:49:49.440 --> 03:49:54.560
need and its reflection in the document. Member Burr, coming back to you.

03:49:56.240 --> 03:50:03.760
I'm just, I'll be brief for a second, I just want to say that I always think of the LCAP as one of a

03:50:03.840 --> 03:50:08.720
piece of many, many pieces of information that are really important to make sure we're focusing

03:50:08.720 --> 03:50:14.320
on the students that need it most and in my view, it would always be helpful to have these

03:50:14.320 --> 03:50:21.440
conversations in the context with the dashboard because recall that the dashboard very specifically

03:50:21.440 --> 03:50:30.640
focuses on subgroups and in fact, LEAs are assessed based on those multiple groups and they're ranked

03:50:30.640 --> 03:50:35.920
according to their colors and they're also identified for additional assistance based on

03:50:35.920 --> 03:50:43.040
subgroup performance so it's, when we talk about the LCAP, the actual template and how we're

03:50:43.040 --> 03:50:49.360
planning to do on behalf of subgroups, it sort of gets lost on what the outcomes are but I do think

03:50:49.360 --> 03:50:55.120
there is some focus on it already in the template and I think it might be helpful for Lindsay if she

03:50:55.120 --> 03:51:00.080
would come back and talk a little bit about that issue because it has been raised by a number of

03:51:00.080 --> 03:51:05.200
folks and I know we all share that same concern and then I'll come back in just a minute after

03:51:05.200 --> 03:51:11.920
Lindsay answers the question. Of course, thank you, thank you all members for your feedback to

03:51:11.920 --> 03:51:15.920
Taking Furious Notes and we always appreciate your feedback as it informs our next steps.

03:51:16.960 --> 03:51:23.440
Yes, Member Burr, so if you look at the plan summary section of the LCAP template specifically

03:51:23.440 --> 03:51:28.880
in the instructions, the section around where LEAs are required to reflect on their identified

03:51:28.880 --> 03:51:35.200
needs, they are directed to refer to the dashboard data to identify any state indicator for which

03:51:35.200 --> 03:51:41.200
overall performance was in the red or orange performance category and received a not met,

03:51:41.200 --> 03:51:46.000
not met for two more years rating and any state indicator for which performance for any student

03:51:46.000 --> 03:51:51.920
group was two or more performance levels below the all student performance and then that is a long,

03:51:51.920 --> 03:51:58.080
that has been a requirement and then in addition to that requirement, we now also have the requirement

03:51:58.080 --> 03:52:04.240
that LEAs who have been identified based on student performance outcomes for the two or three

03:52:04.240 --> 03:52:11.840
year requirements also have to add in a required goal into their LCAP that addresses each of the

03:52:11.840 --> 03:52:21.040
student groups that are not performing. Thank you, Lindsay. So hopefully that addresses some

03:52:21.040 --> 03:52:26.240
of the concerns that were raised by a number of the groups. I just want just in keeping with that

03:52:26.240 --> 03:52:31.840
same theme, the one piece I wanted to mention is that while a lot of attention from the speakers

03:52:32.560 --> 03:52:38.960
especially relied on a recent report by PPIC, the Public Policy Institute of California,

03:52:39.520 --> 03:52:45.280
about expenditures and pointed to the needs that are identified and a lot of the changes we're

03:52:45.280 --> 03:52:50.800
making here about being clear about where the expenditures are being made especially on behalf

03:52:50.800 --> 03:52:55.600
of the students that are most in need. The part that sort of got lost in the shuffle in my view

03:52:56.240 --> 03:53:04.240
was that in fact student performance has improved, that LCFF is working as it's intended to.

03:53:04.240 --> 03:53:09.040
So I encourage folks to look at that. I'll just talk a little bit. There's graduation rate

03:53:09.040 --> 03:53:15.680
improvements, the gaps are closing among subgroups, there's improvements in A to G completion, so

03:53:15.680 --> 03:53:21.120
those are high school indicators that they looked at, but they also looked at some limited data and

03:53:21.120 --> 03:53:27.280
admittedly we know that this data is truncated because of the pandemic, but with respect to

03:53:27.280 --> 03:53:33.040
test scores and the elementary grade levels, one of the things that I thought was most important

03:53:33.040 --> 03:53:40.960
to share is that the number of low-income students scoring far below standard has fallen notably,

03:53:40.960 --> 03:53:48.560
which says to me that the LEAs are focusing most on the students who need it and trying to get them

03:53:48.560 --> 03:53:54.080
up to grade level. So while these are very preliminary results, they are important and again

03:53:54.080 --> 03:53:59.200
I sort of want to make sure we don't lose the plot line here that what we're trying to do here on

03:53:59.200 --> 03:54:04.960
behalf of students who have historically been underserved is working and we need to stay the

03:54:04.960 --> 03:54:11.120
course. So I just want to make sure that that didn't go unsaid and with that I would be happy

03:54:11.120 --> 03:54:18.960
to move the department recommendation. I'm happy Board Member Patia Bronson to suggest your change.

03:54:18.960 --> 03:54:24.720
I think it's a helpful one to include the parenthetical statement about TK to 12 to make sure

03:54:25.280 --> 03:54:30.160
and I didn't get the specific line reference, so if you want to add that I'd be happy to take

03:54:30.160 --> 03:54:34.640
that as a friendly amendment, but I make the recommendation that's shown on the screen.

03:54:35.600 --> 03:54:37.120
And I will second it.

03:54:38.960 --> 03:54:41.440
Terrific. Any further discussion of the motion?

03:54:42.480 --> 03:54:45.360
I would like to also ask for a friendly amendment.

03:54:50.240 --> 03:54:55.600
Um I'm not okay why don't why don't we hear what your thought is but we may need to vote on the

03:54:55.600 --> 03:55:02.720
one that's before us so before we we hear but go ahead. As it relates to the issue I raised on

03:55:02.720 --> 03:55:08.880
accountability, can we take a look at that verb encourage? I worked in a district where they

03:55:08.880 --> 03:55:15.280
where our contract language said we will strive to maintain a ratio of 28 students to one. That's

03:55:15.280 --> 03:55:22.320
about as useful as you know lipstick on a pig. So is it possible to change into the verb encourage

03:55:22.320 --> 03:55:30.000
to a more transitive verb like should or shall or must instead of encourage?

03:55:32.880 --> 03:55:37.680
I'm going to go back to Sue and you know she's the motion maker. I'm sorry I don't understand

03:55:37.680 --> 03:55:44.400
the context member Rucker so I need a little bit more context or specific about what you're asking

03:55:44.400 --> 03:55:54.000
for. I think you're on mute Patricia.

03:55:54.240 --> 03:56:00.240
I did I immediately muted myself after the after I made my comment. Could we go back to the first

03:56:00.240 --> 03:56:11.040
slide of the slide one of two on the recommendation? Okay so with um as it relates to the revisions

03:56:11.040 --> 03:56:16.240
that are being added in the guidance this is actually related to what's in on number one

03:56:16.240 --> 03:56:21.200
on explaining what the what will be happening with the increased and improved services

03:56:21.200 --> 03:56:29.440
section. It says that districts will be encouraged to address or to report

03:56:30.560 --> 03:56:35.440
how they are directing the funds and I'm recommending instead of using the verb

03:56:35.440 --> 03:56:42.480
encouraged in the guidance to change it to district should report or identify how they

03:56:42.640 --> 03:56:47.360
report or identify how they direct. It's on page 25.

03:56:52.640 --> 03:56:56.160
I don't know if I can second a friendly amendment but I agree with that.

03:56:58.080 --> 03:57:02.800
And it may be we might need to do it somewhere outside the bounds of Robert's rules but

03:57:02.800 --> 03:57:09.600
yeah maybe we might need to do this separately from this motion but I think it's important

03:57:09.600 --> 03:57:19.040
to make that change. So member Burr this is your motion so we'll come back to you. I guess I'm not

03:57:19.040 --> 03:57:24.800
comfortable with it just because of all of the feedback that we received from stakeholders on

03:57:24.800 --> 03:57:32.560
the very thoughtful and um comprehensive process that went into this feedback so I'd be happy to

03:57:32.560 --> 03:57:37.360
have you do it as a separate motion if you want and folks can vote on it but I would like to stick

03:57:37.360 --> 03:57:43.520
with the recommendation as written. Well then technically what that would mean is we would

03:57:43.520 --> 03:57:50.640
vote on this motion and if the motion passes under Robert's rules I'd be asking for reconsideration

03:57:50.640 --> 03:57:57.680
to amend a motion we just approved. I think that makes it more unnecessarily complicated

03:57:57.680 --> 03:58:05.120
to do that so rather than hold this up because I think it is important for us to move on the

03:58:05.200 --> 03:58:10.960
recommendations and the updated revisions because as I did say this goes a long way to making

03:58:10.960 --> 03:58:15.760
improvements I'm just not going to I'm going to withhold the vote and not vote on this motion

03:58:15.760 --> 03:58:22.480
because I am concerned about that particular statement and lack of emphasis that should be

03:58:22.480 --> 03:58:31.920
in this amended update. I will also note as we get ready to vote that the motion does say that

03:58:31.920 --> 03:58:40.080
the CDE will with state board staff look at the language and the wording of the various parts of

03:58:40.080 --> 03:58:45.920
the template as it moves towards and I know they're taking account of our comments so I

03:58:46.960 --> 03:58:52.960
hope the CDE staff will take account of these comments and think about where those how those

03:58:52.960 --> 03:59:01.120
might be incorporated but we will vote on the motion as it is proposed and with that I'll ask

03:59:01.920 --> 03:59:12.320
Brooks Allen if he will call the roll. Member Sun. Aye. Vice President Strauss. Yes. Member

03:59:12.320 --> 03:59:24.000

Yes. Member Escobedo. Yes. Member Burr. Aye. Member Bonacca. Aye. Motion passes.

03:59:53.840 --> 03:59:59.840
Thank you. This has been a long process of getting from where we started to where we are

03:59:59.840 --> 04:00:06.000
and I think a lot of good work in the in the course of it. We're now going to take a 30 minute

04:00:06.000 --> 04:00:11.760
break. I'd like to thank Lindsay and Josh for you know the presentation all the work that went

04:00:11.760 --> 04:00:20.240
into it and the board members for this thoughtful discussion. We'll come back at 1 10. Please turn

04:00:20.240 --> 04:00:25.440
off your microphones and cameras during the break and turn your cameras back on after the

04:00:25.440 --> 04:00:33.680
break to reestablish the quorum but do not leave the meeting. Thank you.

04:00:55.440 --> 04:01:17.520
Welcome back. I think we have a quorum and I'd like to ask Brooks Allen to call the roll to establish it.

04:01:18.480 --> 04:01:25.200
Member Son. Present. Vice President Strauss. Present. Member Rucker.

04:01:28.960 --> 04:01:40.480
Member Rodriguez. Here. Member Petillo-Brownson. Here. Member McQuillan. Here. Member Glover Woods.

04:01:53.520 --> 04:02:02.000
Here. You have a quorum. Very good. We're going to move to agenda item number six which is the

04:02:02.000 --> 04:02:08.320
update to California's Every Student Succeeds Act state plan. We're asked to approve amendments

04:02:08.560 --> 04:02:16.160
to the state plan pending the executive director's approval of final revisions

04:02:16.160 --> 04:02:24.000
requested by the SBE that we may make here today. The item will be presented by Joe Sands of the CDE.

04:02:24.640 --> 04:02:30.640
Joe, please begin. Thank you.

04:02:33.280 --> 04:02:36.800
Good afternoon State Board President Darling-Hammond and State Board members.

04:02:37.680 --> 04:02:42.400
My name is Joe Sands. I'm the federal policy liaison for the California Department of Education

04:02:42.400 --> 04:02:47.280
Government Affairs Division. I am proud to be supported today in this presentation by

04:02:47.280 --> 04:02:51.520
Kristen Cruz-Allen and Monique McWane of the Educator Excellence and Equity Division

04:02:52.320 --> 04:02:56.560
as well as Cindy Kazanis, Director of the Analysis, Measurement, and Accountability

04:02:56.560 --> 04:03:02.560
Reporting Division. Today we will be presenting item six update to California's Every Student

04:03:02.560 --> 04:03:08.880
Succeeds Act state plan approval of the state amendments to the state plan. Next slide please.

04:03:12.400 --> 04:03:16.880
The following topics will be covered in this presentation. We will provide a very brief

04:03:16.880 --> 04:03:22.240
background on the Every Student Succeeds Act also known as ESSA. We will also provide the

04:03:22.240 --> 04:03:26.800
current definitions for ineffective and out-of-field teachers under California's ESSA

04:03:26.800 --> 04:03:32.720
Consolidated State Plan. Finally we will walk you through the proposed amendments to California's

04:03:32.720 --> 04:03:38.000
ESSA Consolidated State Plan which includes an update to the definition for out-of-field teachers

04:03:38.000 --> 04:03:45.840
based on feedback from the field. Next slide please. The CDE recommends that the State Board

04:03:45.840 --> 04:03:51.920
of Education approve the amendments to California's ESSA Consolidated State Plan pending the SBE

04:03:51.920 --> 04:03:55.680
Executive Director approval of final revisions requested by the SBE,

04:03:56.800 --> 04:04:02.880
correction of any typographical errors, and necessary non-substantive clarifying edits.

04:04:05.120 --> 04:04:06.080
Next slide please.

04:04:08.480 --> 04:04:12.640
First we would like to provide some brief background regarding the ESSA and California's

04:04:12.640 --> 04:04:17.360
Consolidated State Plan. We'll go to the next slide on that.

04:04:18.160 --> 04:04:23.520
The ESSA was signed into law by President Obama in December of 2015 and it was a reauthorization

04:04:23.520 --> 04:04:29.360
of the Federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The ESSA replaced the No Child Left Behind

04:04:29.360 --> 04:04:35.040
Act and a major goal of the ESSA is to ensure educational equity and opportunity for disadvantaged

04:04:35.040 --> 04:04:41.280
and high-need students and it is meant to supplement state programs. Now I will be passing

04:04:41.280 --> 04:04:45.680
the presentation to Kristen Cruz-Allen and Monique McWane of the Educator Excellence

04:04:45.680 --> 04:04:55.200
and Equity Division. Thank you very much, Joe. Good afternoon. So the actual ESSA provision that

04:04:55.200 --> 04:05:03.440
we will be addressing today is section 1112B2, which requires local educational agencies to

04:05:03.440 --> 04:05:08.640
describe how they will identify and address any disparities that result in low-income

04:05:08.640 --> 04:05:14.800
and minority students being taught at higher rates than other students in the state.

04:05:16.480 --> 04:05:25.520
Ineffective, inexperienced, or out-of-field teachers.

04:05:29.280 --> 04:05:35.440
California sought extensive stakeholder input when addressing these requirements in its initial

04:05:35.440 --> 04:05:40.960
plan submission, but was asked by local educational agencies to provide additional

04:05:40.960 --> 04:05:47.360
specification for the ineffective and out-of-field teacher definitions. Specifically,

04:05:47.360 --> 04:05:55.680
local educational agencies asked CDE to specify where teachers with certain certificates such as

04:05:55.680 --> 04:06:01.600
provisional internship permits or PIPs or short-term waivers should be reported.

04:06:02.720 --> 04:06:07.920
After collaborating with the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, the CDE brought revisions for

04:06:08.000 --> 04:06:14.000
ineffective and out-of-field teacher definitions to the board, which contained the specifications

04:06:14.000 --> 04:06:22.480
that LEAs were seeking in November of 2019. California had also requested an extension

04:06:22.480 --> 04:06:28.560
for providing data related to the equity portion of the consolidated state plan until the data

04:06:28.560 --> 04:06:33.680
sharing memorandum of understanding could be executed with the California Commission on

04:06:33.680 --> 04:06:39.280
Teacher Credentialing, and the first year of data from the California Statewide Assignment

04:06:39.280 --> 04:06:47.040
Accountability System or CALSAS could be verified. These proposed amendments and teacher data tables

04:06:47.040 --> 04:06:51.440
allow California to come into compliance with a completed state plan.

04:06:54.640 --> 04:06:58.800
I'd like to briefly review the definitions that currently exist

04:06:59.760 --> 04:07:06.400
in the California Consolidated State Plan. So the definition for ineffective teacher

04:07:06.400 --> 04:07:11.920
is any of the following. An individual whose assignment is legally authorized by an emergency

04:07:11.920 --> 04:07:17.920
permit that does not require possession of a full teaching license. A teacher who holds

04:07:17.920 --> 04:07:23.600
a teaching credential but does not possess a permit or an authorization that temporarily allows

04:07:23.600 --> 04:07:31.200
them to teach outside of their credentialed area. And an individual who holds no credential

04:07:31.200 --> 04:07:41.120
permit or authorization to teach in California. To address the specifications that LEAs were

04:07:41.120 --> 04:07:47.680
asking for, the certifications on the screen that you're looking at now were added to this

04:07:47.760 --> 04:07:54.400
definition and they include provisional internship permits, short-term staff permits or STIPs,

04:07:55.120 --> 04:08:02.080
variable term waivers, and substitute permits or teaching permits for statutory leave holders

04:08:02.080 --> 04:08:13.280
serving as teacher of record. As for the definition for out of field teacher, in November 2019 it was

04:08:13.360 --> 04:08:19.120
revised to read a credentialed out of field teacher is a credentialed teacher who has not

04:08:19.120 --> 04:08:25.360
yet demonstrated subject matter competence in the subject area for the student population for which

04:08:25.360 --> 04:08:36.800
he or she is assigned. Again to address the specifications that local educational agencies

04:08:36.800 --> 04:08:43.840
were asking for, the certifications on this slide that were added are bolded slightly.

04:08:44.640 --> 04:08:50.720
Originally we had only listed general education limited assignment permits and special education

04:08:50.720 --> 04:08:57.920
limited assignment permits, also known as GLAPS and C-LAPS, but also added to the out of field

04:08:57.920 --> 04:09:05.280
teacher definition was short-term waivers, emergency English learner or bilingual authorization permits,

04:09:05.840 --> 04:09:13.360
and local assignment options. I would now like to turn it over to Monique McWane who will discuss

04:09:13.360 --> 04:09:22.000
the proposed amendments. Thank you Kristen. So good afternoon, I am Monique McWane of the Educator

04:09:22.000 --> 04:09:28.000
Excellence and Equity Division. Today we are proposing amendments to California's state plan

04:09:28.000 --> 04:09:34.800
related to the teacher definitions which Kristen described and data that was just discussed.

04:09:35.280 --> 04:09:45.600
So when the department updated the definition of out of field in consultation with the California

04:09:45.600 --> 04:09:54.320
Commission on Teacher Credentially, designation of teachers on local assignment options was added.

04:09:55.600 --> 04:10:02.240
If an employing agency is unable to assign a teacher or other certificated employee with the

04:10:02.320 --> 04:10:07.440
appropriate credential, they can utilize a local assignment option.

04:10:08.960 --> 04:10:15.360
Local assignment options are provisions within the education code and Title V regulations that

04:10:15.360 --> 04:10:22.800
permit the governing board of a local educational agency to otherwise legally authorize a fully

04:10:22.800 --> 04:10:29.600
credentialed educator to serve in an assignment outside the area authorized by their credential.

04:10:30.560 --> 04:10:35.680
There are over 40 different types of local assignment options that are utilized in California,

04:10:36.480 --> 04:10:43.120
but only one local assignment option which is authorized in California Code Regulations Title

04:10:43.120 --> 04:10:54.160
V, Section 8005B, which allows kindergarten through grade 12 staff to teach courses within

04:10:54.160 --> 04:11:00.880
their grade level authorization for which no credential exists. There are only specific

04:11:00.880 --> 04:11:09.040
courses where the application of this local assignment option applies. The complete list

04:11:09.040 --> 04:11:16.640
of specific courses are posted on the commission's website. Examples of this are teachers that teach

04:11:16.640 --> 04:11:23.840
study skills courses and student government courses. Teachers that teach these courses

04:11:23.840 --> 04:11:29.920
are credentialed in other areas, but must be placed on this local assignment option to teach

04:11:29.920 --> 04:11:37.120
these courses for which no credential exists. Because of this, the department is proposing

04:11:37.120 --> 04:11:47.520
that local assignment options authorized in Section 8005B, which allow kindergarten through grade 12

04:11:47.520 --> 04:11:54.080
staff to teach courses within their grade level authorization, be exempted from the out-of-field

04:11:54.080 --> 04:12:08.160
designation. Additionally, the state plan is amended to add the following data tables

04:12:09.040 --> 04:12:15.200
which are listed on your screen related to ineffective teachers to meet requirements

04:12:15.200 --> 04:12:17.680
from the United States Department of Education.

04:12:21.600 --> 04:12:28.400
The data tables are Table 30B, 2019-20 Ineffective Teachers for Title I Schools

04:12:28.400 --> 04:12:40.000
by Minority Student Enrollment. Table 31B, 2019-20 Ineffective Teachers for Title I Schools by

04:12:40.000 --> 04:12:49.200
Socio-Economically Disadvantaged Student Enrollment. Table 32B, 2019-20 Ineffective Teachers

04:12:49.200 --> 04:12:56.240
by Socio-Economically Disadvantaged Student Enrollment. The amended version of the state

04:12:56.240 --> 04:13:06.080
plan, which is Attachment 2, updates column headers in Tables 30B, 31B, and 32B. Additionally,

04:13:06.080 --> 04:13:13.840
it corrects a data error in Table 30B and makes grammatical edits in Table 28.

04:13:17.840 --> 04:13:20.800
Thank you for listening to our presentation of this item.

04:13:20.800 --> 04:13:25.840
I will hand this to back, and President Darling-Tammon, are there any questions?

04:13:25.840 --> 04:13:37.600
Let me get myself off of mute. Thank you very much for the presentation and the clear explanation.

04:13:38.720 --> 04:13:43.840
And at this point, we want to open, we want to put the slide up for the public comment

04:13:44.560 --> 04:13:49.040
and open up the public comment queue. Members of the public wishing to provide comment

04:13:49.040 --> 04:13:54.560
should call the phone number listed and use the access code provided on the slide that is shown.

04:13:54.640 --> 04:13:58.480
And while we're waiting for members of the public to call in, I want to ask Member Son

04:13:58.480 --> 04:14:03.040
if she has any initial comments before me. And then I'll ask board members if they have

04:14:03.040 --> 04:14:08.320
any clarifying questions before we go to public comment. Member Son.

04:14:09.120 --> 04:14:16.080
Thank you. Yes, so I know that whenever this topic of teacher definitions comes up, it's sometimes

04:14:16.080 --> 04:14:20.880
a little bit awkward because I feel like we're always trying to put a square peg in this round

04:14:20.880 --> 04:14:28.320
whole because we are needing to follow the federal definitions and titles for these teachers,

04:14:28.320 --> 04:14:33.760
and we have to take our credentialing system and our authorizations and try to fit them within those

04:14:35.040 --> 04:14:43.280
particular titles. So I appreciate the work that CDE staff has done in partnership with the

04:14:43.280 --> 04:14:49.280
Commission on Teacher Credentialing staff getting this data. It is new. I think they're continuing

04:14:49.280 --> 04:14:54.560
to work on systems so that we can gather this data, but I am very encouraged that now we have

04:14:54.560 --> 04:15:00.880
some information and that we'll be continuing to follow these trends. And the other piece, too,

04:15:00.880 --> 04:15:07.120
I just want to encourage, I know this is a very difficult time for our LEAs with teacher shortages,

04:15:07.120 --> 04:15:15.040
and it's very difficult to find teachers with the correct authorizations in their subject areas

04:15:15.840 --> 04:15:23.920
because of so many teachers who've retired and have left the profession. So I know this is a

04:15:23.920 --> 04:15:27.840
very important work, and I encourage that partnership with the Commission on Teacher

04:15:27.840 --> 04:15:36.320
Credentialing and in the study that the Commission is also doing to take a look at the needs of

04:15:36.320 --> 04:15:43.600
credentialing in California over the next few years. So yeah, so that's my general comments.

04:15:43.600 --> 04:15:51.040
Thank you. Thank you, Member Sun. And I'm reminded as you speak that you and I have had the

04:15:51.040 --> 04:15:54.720
privilege of serving on both the Teacher Credentialing Commission and the State Board

04:15:54.720 --> 04:16:02.480
and watching this process unfold. And that's also true of Member Rodriguez. So we have a perspective

04:16:02.480 --> 04:16:08.800
on how important these data are, how important they are for equity purposes, to see where

04:16:09.760 --> 04:16:16.400
students are getting access to well-qualified teachers, and to the policy environment where

04:16:16.400 --> 04:16:21.600
we're really always trying to understand what's going on so that we can make the investments that

04:16:21.600 --> 04:16:28.000
are needed to bring people in and keep them in the profession. So it's wonderful to see the data.

04:16:28.000 --> 04:16:33.200
We appreciate the staff's work on this and the fine-tuning of the definitions

04:16:34.000 --> 04:16:43.440
to make sense in our system. With that, if there are any particular clarifying questions

04:16:43.440 --> 04:16:49.360
only at this point before we go to public comment, I'll see if anyone has any of those,

04:16:49.360 --> 04:16:55.200
and then we'll open for more discussion after public comment. I see one clarifying question

04:16:55.200 --> 04:17:02.480
coming from Member Rodriguez. Yes, hi. Thank you so much for the presentation. And I understand

04:17:02.880 --> 04:17:07.600
we are working within these parameters. I did have a question about the out-of-field teacher,

04:17:07.600 --> 04:17:13.920
and I've brought this up before, because I teach AVID, even though I'm credentialed to teach English,

04:17:13.920 --> 04:17:20.480
Spanish, and social studies, I'm classified as an out-of-field teacher. And I was wondering,

04:17:20.480 --> 04:17:25.840
when you mentioned the study skills, does that qualify under that? And is it the district who

04:17:25.840 --> 04:17:38.320
will then add the exemption on their behalf? I can take that one. I also am a former history

04:17:38.320 --> 04:17:45.280
social science teacher that taught AVID, so I can feel you, your pain in that situation.

04:17:46.000 --> 04:17:50.800
But you are exactly the teacher we're talking about. That would be under local assignment option

04:17:50.800 --> 04:17:59.760
800005B. So AVID does count there. And so this would take you out of the out-of-field category.

04:18:00.800 --> 04:18:07.600
I take that one, 800005B. That's you. All right. Thank you. Thank you. I always feel so bad when I

04:18:07.600 --> 04:18:11.120
have to sign the little paper that I'm teaching out-of-field. I'm like, ah.

04:18:11.920 --> 04:18:19.520
No, you do not get reported in these data. Any other clarifying questions?

04:18:20.800 --> 04:18:23.200
All right. With that, we'll go to public comment.

04:18:24.880 --> 04:18:31.760
We do have one speaker for item number six. Speaker, please state your name and affiliation

04:18:31.760 --> 04:18:39.920
for the record. Your time starts now. Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond

04:18:39.920 --> 04:18:46.240
and board members. Liz Guian with Public Advocates for the LCFS Equity Coalition.

04:18:47.120 --> 04:18:53.440
We support this item and we really appreciate the mock tables that were attached to this item.

04:18:53.440 --> 04:18:59.680
But we want to repeat our request that we made in May and July that the board call for a data

04:18:59.680 --> 04:19:07.360
quest sample teacher data display with data from the 1920 initial data match so that it reflects

04:19:07.360 --> 04:19:14.400
appropriately assigned and fully credentialed teachers and gives us the opportunity to see

04:19:14.400 --> 04:19:21.040
the display and review it and comment. The presentation of such a display with actual data

04:19:21.040 --> 04:19:26.960
would give us and the public an opportunity to give feedback as the department continues to

04:19:26.960 --> 04:19:33.360
fine-tune the presentation of teacher quality data in the dashboard in preparation for the

04:19:33.360 --> 04:19:39.440
full data quest rollout in late 2021. We thank you and we thank the department for all its hard work

04:19:40.240 --> 04:19:45.920
in this area. Thanks. Thank you. This concludes public comment.

04:19:48.800 --> 04:19:56.400
All right. Thank you very much. Is there board discussion at this point? I see Vice President

04:19:56.400 --> 04:20:03.440
Strauss. Thank you and thank you so much for, Kristen, for the work and for the whole,

04:20:04.080 --> 04:20:08.800
I know this is really challenging and particularly in a secondary school. I just appreciated member

04:20:08.800 --> 04:20:16.240
Rodriguez's example, which actually you also have, Kristen. And I think it just shows the challenges

04:20:16.240 --> 04:20:21.840
we have in trying and making sure that we have teachers fully credentialed that know the content

04:20:21.840 --> 04:20:27.600
and the pedagogy for the grade level that they're assigned. And then there are electives like AVID,

04:20:27.600 --> 04:20:33.520
all kinds of different electives and study skill courses that we have to look at local decision

04:20:33.520 --> 04:20:38.560
making to make sure we provide the support with teachers who have experience at that grade level

04:20:38.960 --> 04:20:43.840
and also understanding that it's a complicated puzzle when you're putting together a student six

04:20:43.840 --> 04:20:50.160
or seven period day with teachers and how you manage all that. So I appreciated all the work

04:20:50.800 --> 04:20:54.800
to having all these different credentials, but at some time you're going to need local

04:20:54.800 --> 04:21:00.160
authorization. I think particularly with electives and support classes, it becomes really important.

04:21:00.160 --> 04:21:07.040
And so as we can meet the intent of the law and still give districts the support and flexibility

04:21:07.040 --> 04:21:12.000
they need, I think we need to continue to make that a priority. So students get the support

04:21:12.640 --> 04:21:17.360
and that we can meet all of our requirements that we continue to add to try to meet student

04:21:17.360 --> 04:21:28.080
diverse needs. Thank you. Thank you. Are there any other comments? This is an information item.

04:21:28.080 --> 04:21:35.280
And I'll just reinforce the comment that came from

04:21:37.280 --> 04:21:43.680
public advocates that, you know, we would love to see the tables as they're being developed as

04:21:43.680 --> 04:21:48.320
the reporting structure comes along, because it'll be a very important part of the

04:21:49.600 --> 04:21:55.680
actual rationale for this work that will inform the public in some very important ways.

04:21:56.240 --> 04:22:07.520
And seeing no other comments, I'm told that we should now take another break, which is a lovely

04:22:07.520 --> 04:22:13.600
thing since we just had one. But I think we need to take another little 10 minute break,

04:22:13.600 --> 04:22:20.640
and we'll be back at 1.40. Excuse me, President Darling-Hammond, this is an action item.

04:22:20.640 --> 04:22:31.680
Oh, it is. Okay. I'm sorry. Then we do need. Oh, yes, we do have to pass this. Yes. Sorry about that.

04:22:32.480 --> 04:22:38.160
Let's see if there's a motion. I will make the motion. Thank you very much.

04:22:39.520 --> 04:22:46.560
And I'll second it. Thank you. Any further discussion? All right. Brooks, call the roll.

04:22:47.360 --> 04:22:58.480
Member Sun. Aye. Vice President Strauss. Yes. Member Rucker. Yes. Member Rodriguez. Yes.

04:22:59.040 --> 04:23:06.080
Member Patillo-Brownson. Yes. Member McQuillan. Yes. Member Glover-Woods.

04:23:07.440 --> 04:23:12.160
Yes. Member Escobedo. Yes. President Darling-Hammond.

04:23:12.160 --> 04:23:20.960
Yes. Member Burr. Aye. Member Bonacca. Aye. That's unanimously.

04:23:22.880 --> 04:23:29.200
All right. And I'm going to ask you, Executive Director Allen, whether there is a reason that

04:23:29.200 --> 04:23:34.480
we need to take a break at this time, or can we continue on? We can continue. Thank you.

04:23:35.360 --> 04:23:41.600
I'm following the script, which caused me to believe this was an information item,

04:23:41.600 --> 04:23:45.760
and that we needed to take a break. But we will continue on, because we have a lot to do.

04:23:45.760 --> 04:23:50.160
We want to get out of here by dinnertime, and I think folks had a nice lunch break.

04:23:50.160 --> 04:23:58.240
So we'll move on to item seven, which is a wonderful item. This is an item on the National

04:23:58.240 --> 04:24:02.240
Board for Professional Teaching Standards Certification Incentive Program. It's actually

04:24:02.240 --> 04:24:08.000
related to the last item that we just heard, because this is really a way to address the needs

04:24:08.000 --> 04:24:13.520
for both getting and keeping teachers in our highest-need schools, where the turnover is often

04:24:13.520 --> 04:24:19.920
the greatest. So the CDE recommends that the State Board approve the program Information Criteria

04:24:19.920 --> 04:24:24.640
Procedures and Application for the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards Certification

04:24:24.640 --> 04:24:29.760
Incentive Program. And this item will be presented by Monique McWane of the CDE. Thank you.

04:24:29.760 --> 04:24:36.320
I would first like to hand it to Deputy Cotton

04:24:37.680 --> 04:24:41.360
to begin our presentation. I believe she's in the boardroom.

04:24:45.360 --> 04:24:53.920
Deputy Superintendent Cotton. I believe I can be heard. Okay, great. You can be heard.

04:24:55.120 --> 04:24:58.880
Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond, Vice President Strauss, Superintendent Thurmond,

04:24:58.880 --> 04:25:02.640
and members of the State Board. I'm Cheryl Cotton, Deputy Superintendent of Instruction,

04:25:02.640 --> 04:25:06.320
Measurement, and Administration Branch, and I have the pleasure of introducing this item.

04:25:10.000 --> 04:25:17.840
Today our team will provide a brief background on the National Board for Professional Teaching

04:25:17.840 --> 04:25:24.720
Standards, MBPTS, Certification Incentive Program that was included in the 2021 budget.

04:25:25.520 --> 04:25:30.800
The program includes incentives for current National Board Certified Teachers, or MBCTs,

04:25:31.520 --> 04:25:36.000
as well as a subsidy to assist teachers that would like to obtain National Board certification

04:25:36.000 --> 04:25:41.520
with the costs associated with certification. Teachers that are eligible for these incentives

04:25:41.520 --> 04:25:46.960
must teach at high priority schools, and we will discuss how the Budget Act of 2021 defines high

04:25:46.960 --> 04:25:53.280
priority schools. In addition, we will discuss each program's timeline and application process.

04:25:54.800 --> 04:26:00.160
The California Department of Education, or CDE, recommends that the State Board of Education, SBE,

04:26:00.160 --> 04:26:07.120
approve the program information, criteria, procedures, and application for the MBPTS

04:26:07.120 --> 04:26:12.400
Certification Incentive Program. We appreciate your consideration, and now I will hand it over

04:26:12.400 --> 04:26:18.080
to Monique McWane and Kristen Cruz-Allen of the Educator Excellence and Equity Division

04:26:18.080 --> 04:26:20.800
to provide additional details of this item.

04:26:24.720 --> 04:26:32.400
Thank you, Deputy Cotton. I am Monique McWane of the Educator Excellence and Equity Division again,

04:26:32.400 --> 04:26:36.880
and I will be presenting this item with my colleague, Kristen Cruz-Allen, Administrator

04:26:36.880 --> 04:26:44.560
of the Teacher Leader Policy Office. Assembly Bill 130 reestablished the National Board

04:26:44.560 --> 04:26:50.400
Professional Teaching Standards Certification Incentive Program to award grants to school

04:26:50.400 --> 04:26:57.200
districts for the purpose of providing awards to teachers who are assigned to teach in high priority

04:26:57.200 --> 04:27:04.320
California public schools and have attained certification from the National Board. This

04:27:04.320 --> 04:27:11.520
bill requires the State Board of Education to approve the program information, criteria,

04:27:11.520 --> 04:27:15.040
procedures, and application for this program, as mentioned.

04:27:15.040 --> 04:27:22.640
Any teacher who has already attained certification from the National Board

04:27:22.640 --> 04:27:30.880
is eligible to receive an award of $5,000 each if the teacher agrees to teach at a high priority

04:27:30.880 --> 04:27:40.320
school for at least five years for a total of up to $25,000. In addition, this program will provide

04:27:41.280 --> 04:27:48.720
a $2,500 subsidy for teachers at high priority schools who initiate and complete the process

04:27:48.720 --> 04:27:52.720
of pursuing national board certification to cover the costs of the program.

04:27:53.600 --> 04:27:59.280
The sum of $250 million is available from the state budget for these purposes.

04:28:00.160 --> 04:28:06.000
Of this amount, at least $25 million must be used to cover the National Board for Professional

04:28:06.000 --> 04:28:13.440
Teaching Standards Certification fees for first-time candidates. The remainder of the funds

04:28:13.440 --> 04:28:18.000
shall be used to award grants pursuant to the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards

04:28:18.000 --> 04:28:26.960
Certification Incentive Program. For reference, if all current 4,331 National Board Certified

04:28:26.960 --> 04:28:32.720
Teachers in California were to teach for five years at a school on the high priority school list,

04:28:32.720 --> 04:28:40.400
the fiscal cost would be over $100 million. This would leave over $140 million to provide

04:28:40.400 --> 04:28:46.880
the subsidies to over 55,000 new candidates in the next five years.

04:28:50.240 --> 04:28:56.480
High priority schools. California Assembly Bill 130 also defines high priority schools

04:28:56.560 --> 04:29:02.480
to those with 55% or more of its unduplicated pupils classified as English learner,

04:29:03.120 --> 04:29:09.920
foster youth, or eligible for a free or reduced price meal. The list of high priority schools

04:29:10.720 --> 04:29:19.840
for the 2021-22 school year can be accessed on the department's National Board Certification

04:29:19.840 --> 04:29:31.600
Incentive Program webpage. There are currently 6,725 high priority schools based on 2020-21

04:29:31.600 --> 04:29:36.480
California Longitudinal Public Achievement Data Systems Information, or CALPATS.

04:29:41.200 --> 04:29:47.760
To note, teachers that qualify for the program at a high priority school will not have to change

04:29:47.760 --> 04:29:55.120
schools if the school's enrollment data dips below 55% in the subsequent year.

04:30:01.600 --> 04:30:06.000
In addition to the incentive for existing National Board Certified Teachers,

04:30:06.000 --> 04:30:11.200
the state is also providing a grant subsidy to support the new candidates working in high

04:30:11.200 --> 04:30:16.480
priority schools that initiate the process for pursuing National Board Certification.

04:30:17.760 --> 04:30:24.640
To be eligible, candidates must meet all eligible criteria set forth by the National Board,

04:30:25.600 --> 04:30:33.040
register with the National Board by February 28, 2022, work in a high priority school,

04:30:33.680 --> 04:30:38.800
and work in eligible assignments and school sites, which we will discuss on future slides.

04:30:39.200 --> 04:30:46.160
To be eligible to enter a National Board Program, educators must possess a bachelor's degree from a

04:30:46.160 --> 04:30:52.240
accredited institution, candidates for Career and Technical Education Certificates are excluded

04:30:52.240 --> 04:30:58.480
from this requirement in California, have completed three years of successful teaching in one or more

04:30:58.480 --> 04:31:06.480
early childhood, elementary, middle, or secondary school, hold a valid state teaching degree,

04:31:07.200 --> 04:31:13.760
hold a valid state teaching license, or meet the pupil personnel services credential applying for

04:31:13.760 --> 04:31:18.880
early childhood through young adult school counseling certificate for each of the three

04:31:18.880 --> 04:31:25.280
years of employment they verify, and if registering as a world language candidate,

04:31:25.280 --> 04:31:30.400
the educator must provide official American counsel on the teaching of foreign languages,

04:31:30.960 --> 04:31:37.760
certified ratings of advanced low or higher in speaking and writing proficiency assessments.

04:31:42.800 --> 04:31:48.160
The candidate subsidy application. Candidate subsidy applications will be available on the

04:31:48.160 --> 04:31:56.160
department National Board Certification Incentive Program webpage on board approval. Candidates

04:31:56.160 --> 04:31:59.760
need to submit an initial application for the first year of their candidacy.

04:32:00.480 --> 04:32:06.640
Candidates do not need to reapply for the subsidy each year unless they change school sites or

04:32:06.640 --> 04:32:12.640
districts. Candidates status will be verified annually with the National Board as well as

04:32:12.640 --> 04:32:23.120
district staff. Pending board approval, this is the 2021-22 timeline for the subsidy application.

04:32:24.080 --> 04:32:30.720
We hope to post the application quickly if the board approves this at this meeting and close

04:32:30.720 --> 04:32:36.560
the application at the end of January. In February, we will notify applicants if they are approved

04:32:36.560 --> 04:32:40.720
so they have time to complete the National Board registration before it closes at the end of

04:32:40.720 --> 04:32:46.560
February. This timeline will most likely be adjusted in subsequent years to provide candidates more

04:32:46.640 --> 04:32:52.720
time to apply for the program. I am now going to hand the presentation over to

04:32:52.720 --> 04:32:59.760
Kristin Cruz-Allen to present on the incentive program. Thank you. Thank you, Monique.

04:33:01.120 --> 04:33:06.880
So California Assembly Bill 130 stated that in addition to classroom teachers, there are other

04:33:06.880 --> 04:33:14.080
eligible educators for this program which include educators in a teacher leadership role such as

04:33:14.080 --> 04:33:20.560
peer assistance and review coaches, mentors, other teacher support providers, and school

04:33:20.560 --> 04:33:31.440
counselors with pupil personnel services credentials. In addition, AB 130 defined

04:33:31.440 --> 04:33:37.920
eligible entities working in the following high priority local educational agencies,

04:33:37.920 --> 04:33:43.280
including school districts, county boards of education, county superintendent of schools,

04:33:43.840 --> 04:33:52.320
and a number of other locations as noted on this slide including state operated programs,

04:33:52.320 --> 04:34:00.480
special schools, and regional occupational centers. So again, you must be in a high priority school

04:34:01.200 --> 04:34:07.520
but it can be these different types of local educational agencies but they must be high priority.

04:34:07.520 --> 04:34:14.000
So applications for the annual incentive program for current national board certified teachers

04:34:14.480 --> 04:34:21.280
hopefully will be available on our web page very very soon. We actually have them all the

04:34:21.280 --> 04:34:26.080
applications ready to go. If there are any updates that are adopted today, we certainly can make

04:34:26.080 --> 04:34:33.360
those before we post. Similar to the subsidy program, national board certified teachers need

04:34:33.360 --> 04:34:40.400
to submit an initial application for the first year of their incentive and they do not need to

04:34:40.400 --> 04:34:48.080
reapply each year unless they change school sites or districts. And each year CDE staff will verify

04:34:48.080 --> 04:34:53.360
that they were in a teaching position at a high priority school for at least 50 percent of their

04:34:53.360 --> 04:34:59.600
time and we will also be verifying with national board that they have a high priority school

04:34:59.600 --> 04:35:05.200
certification up to date.

04:35:08.560 --> 04:35:15.680
And we'll go to the next slide. So let me see, I think we're actually on the next slide.

04:35:15.680 --> 04:35:24.320
I apologize. Did I skip a slide? I did. Oh here we go. So again, we hope to open the application

04:35:24.320 --> 04:35:33.200
for current national board teachers in January or February of 2022. We will confirm that high

04:35:33.200 --> 04:35:39.360
priority national board certified teachers with national board to make sure that their certification

04:35:39.360 --> 04:35:46.720
is up to date will confirm again in May with the LEAs that these teachers teach at to make sure

04:35:46.720 --> 04:35:53.440
that they completed their school year teaching at least 50 percent of their time. And then in June

04:35:53.440 --> 04:36:00.000
CDE hopes to release payment to the LEAs to disperse out to their national board teachers.

04:36:05.200 --> 04:36:09.680
And one thing that we wanted to note and was really an intent of this legislation

04:36:10.240 --> 04:36:17.760
is that this incentive is really encouraged to supplement existing district incentives.

04:36:17.760 --> 04:36:22.320
We've spoken to many national board teachers and districts within California

04:36:22.320 --> 04:36:27.440
that offer their own incentives to national board certified teachers, but our hope that this will

04:36:27.440 --> 04:36:33.600
supplement and not replace those existing district incentives. And we really encourage

04:36:33.600 --> 04:36:41.040
local educational agencies to maintain their existing stipends in addition to what teachers

04:36:41.040 --> 04:36:48.560
will get through this program. And also we very much encourage school districts to provide adequate

04:36:48.560 --> 04:36:52.720
release time to support teachers to complete their certification process.

04:36:56.160 --> 04:37:03.360
And we just want to note some really important research that I think most members of the board

04:37:03.360 --> 04:37:10.080
are probably pretty familiar with, but we thank our friends at national boards for providing this

04:37:10.080 --> 04:37:15.680
for us. That we know that students that are taught by a national board certified teachers

04:37:16.640 --> 04:37:22.000
typically learn more than their peers and this can generate up to one or two months of additional

04:37:22.000 --> 04:37:29.760
instruction for students and the impact is even greater at high need schools. We also see that

04:37:29.760 --> 04:37:34.640
the research tells us that national board certified teachers remain in the profession longer,

04:37:35.360 --> 04:37:42.000
which is you know critical in California where we're fighting to retain and recruit new teachers

04:37:42.000 --> 04:37:50.240
to the field. And also new teachers that are mentored by national board certified teachers

04:37:50.240 --> 04:37:56.000
exhibit improvement in their practice and generate additional student learning. So we're just very

04:37:56.000 --> 04:38:01.840
very pleased that this program has come back. We can't wait to get started. We have a lot of

04:38:01.840 --> 04:38:07.840
interest. We held an initial webinar just to say the program is coming and we were coming to the

04:38:07.840 --> 04:38:15.840
board today. We had almost 700 people attend that webinar. Lots of questions about eligibility

04:38:16.400 --> 04:38:23.120
and great excitement being generated out in the field. And finally I just want to recognize Sarah

04:38:23.120 --> 04:38:30.240
Pinsky and Stacey Hicks with the national board who have been our absolute partners getting this

04:38:30.240 --> 04:38:34.960
going, this program back in place. They're here with us today in case we have some specific

04:38:34.960 --> 04:38:41.600
questions for them. They've just been invaluable and I also want to recognize Dr. Travis Bristol.

04:38:42.240 --> 04:38:48.880
We worked with him through the diversifying the teacher workforce as he has led the advisory

04:38:48.880 --> 04:38:56.480
board for the California Department of Education and he was newly elected chairman of the national

04:38:56.480 --> 04:39:01.920
board of directors and we look forward to working with him in that capacity as well.

04:39:02.800 --> 04:39:07.760
And I will hand it over to President Darling-Hammond and if there are any questions.

04:39:09.280 --> 04:39:15.520
Let's put up the public comment slide so that we can allow people to queue up. Those who would

04:39:15.520 --> 04:39:22.320
like to call in can use the numbers on the slide and the participant access code. And while we're

04:39:22.320 --> 04:39:29.760
waiting for folks to form that queue I want to turn to Ida Rodriguez. I want to also note that

04:39:30.320 --> 04:39:37.040
member Rodriguez is a national board certified teacher and it's a very rigorous process to

04:39:37.040 --> 04:39:43.120
go through where you have to put together a portfolio of your practice with videotapes

04:39:43.120 --> 04:39:48.400
of your teaching showing how you plan for your classroom and think about the needs of all the

04:39:48.400 --> 04:39:55.120
students demonstrating that on the videotape commentary on that tracking student learning

04:39:55.120 --> 04:40:02.000
gains associated with it. It's a very impressive process. It's like board certification in medicine

04:40:03.120 --> 04:40:12.560
and this policy could really help us make that possible for many more teachers. So member Rodriguez.

04:40:14.000 --> 04:40:20.400
Thank you so much President Darling-Hammond and yes I've been nationally board certified since 2006

04:40:20.400 --> 04:40:30.720
and recertified I think six years ago and I first of all want to thank our state legislature and the

04:40:30.720 --> 04:40:39.760
governor for making this possible because this is the you know like I'm looking at some items

04:40:39.760 --> 04:40:45.200
tomorrow the community schools where we've been talking about deeper learning reaching our students

04:40:45.200 --> 04:40:52.560
equity and national board certification is really kind of like the linchpin right because as teachers

04:40:54.560 --> 04:40:58.480
we're making it happen on making it happen with our students on a day-to-day basis

04:40:59.120 --> 04:41:08.240
and national board certification is by teachers and for teachers right you know I one of my

04:41:08.240 --> 04:41:13.920
first leadership opportunities after having certified was serving on the social studies

04:41:15.680 --> 04:41:20.880
standards committee right and rewriting the social studies standards and so you know here

04:41:20.880 --> 04:41:26.240
I am a national board certified teacher working with other teachers and it's teachers who get to

04:41:26.240 --> 04:41:33.120
look at our practice because we open our classrooms via videotape and we get comments that aren't

04:41:33.120 --> 04:41:39.680
attached to you know if a personality they're not they're they're you know as as objective as

04:41:39.680 --> 04:41:47.600
possible so it's wonderful to see this happening because I think our students will benefit immensely

04:41:47.600 --> 04:41:52.480
and especially as you know as we know with certification in California with students

04:41:52.480 --> 04:41:58.720
teaching I'm sorry teachers teaching out of their certification area or without licenses

04:41:59.280 --> 04:42:04.000
there are our students in the high need schools are the ones that are suffering the most

04:42:04.560 --> 04:42:10.880
and we really want to make sure that they have the most reflective practitioners in front of them

04:42:10.880 --> 04:42:16.640
and the most teachers who have demonstrated accomplishment in this area and I say that I

04:42:16.640 --> 04:42:22.800
emphasize most reflective practitioners because being a national board certified teacher doesn't

04:42:22.800 --> 04:42:28.240
make me better than a teacher next to me who isn't board certified it just means that I took some

04:42:28.240 --> 04:42:36.480
steps to open up my practice to other people and to myself and really examine you know and and and

04:42:36.480 --> 04:42:41.440
and it's continuous because I do this all the time now and it's examining like did this work

04:42:41.440 --> 04:42:48.400
did I reach my students how did I do this and um you know this is this is a great step once

04:42:48.400 --> 04:42:55.840
teachers certified because the the current standards for teaching are little baby national

04:42:55.840 --> 04:43:01.520
board standards right you know I think there's a really nice transition to the updated teacher

04:43:01.520 --> 04:43:08.880
standards from five years ago so I'm I'm very excited to see this here thank you

04:43:10.640 --> 04:43:17.360
I just want to draw a thread to some of the earlier items we had the concerns raised about whether

04:43:17.920 --> 04:43:24.960
the LCFF you know dollars make their way within the school to all the students who need them

04:43:24.960 --> 04:43:29.840
that's often about teacher assignment so whether the students with the greatest needs are getting

04:43:29.840 --> 04:43:35.600
assigned to teachers with the greatest capacity it's about teacher longevity and and stopping

04:43:35.600 --> 04:43:42.720
the churn that happens in a lot of schools and one of the things we know about the longevity and

04:43:42.720 --> 04:43:48.720
effectiveness of national board certified teachers as mentors as well as as individual practitioners

04:43:48.720 --> 04:43:53.120
is that they stabilize when you have enough such teachers in a school they stabilize

04:43:53.760 --> 04:44:00.800
and then grow practice and expertise with their colleagues in the school we heard about the

04:44:01.840 --> 04:44:09.360
data that will be out regarding the access that students have to quote effective teachers

04:44:10.400 --> 04:44:16.560
and again the more experience the more stability the more expertise in a building

04:44:17.360 --> 04:44:25.920
the more students benefit so this is a really important way to transform the school environments

04:44:25.920 --> 04:44:34.080
in many schools and in some places entire faculties or grade levels or departments within schools have

04:44:34.080 --> 04:44:40.080
gone for board certification together reflecting on and sharing their practice so it is part of a

04:44:40.080 --> 04:44:49.440
much more systemic approach to strengthening practice and stabilizing the teaching workforce

04:44:49.440 --> 04:44:56.080
in the schools where we are concerned to ensure that students are getting the benefits of the

04:44:56.080 --> 04:45:01.200
investments that are being made so with that i don't see any other clarifying questions

04:45:01.760 --> 04:45:06.400
i'm going to go to public comment and then we'll come back for discussion and action

04:45:07.360 --> 04:45:10.720
we currently have four speakers for item seven

04:45:11.280 --> 04:45:16.000

good afternoon president darlin hammon and board members i'm tamara simpson california policy

04:46:10.320 --> 04:46:15.520
manager for teach plus our teacher leaders are thrilled that the state has revived the national

04:46:15.520 --> 04:46:20.880
board certification incentive grant program we provide a letter with some recommendations about

04:46:20.880 --> 04:46:26.560
implementation but i want to highlight a few of our recommendations here in developing a long-term

04:46:26.560 --> 04:46:31.440
rollout plan we encourage department staff to think about how these grants can incentivize

04:46:31.440 --> 04:46:36.480
educator behavior in efforts to facilitate smooth transfers to high priority schools for

04:46:37.040 --> 04:46:43.840
interested existing nbcps we recommend either a third application pathway this year or releasing

04:46:43.840 --> 04:46:51.520
the 2022 2023 application details early in 2022 with the goal of processing all such applications

04:46:51.520 --> 04:46:57.680
by june 2022 we strongly encourage the department to offer technical assistance to lea's

04:46:57.680 --> 04:47:02.480
particularly those with several high priority schools finally if the department staff has not

04:47:02.480 --> 04:47:08.000
already done so we recommend instituting a teacher advisory process for developing and rolling out

04:47:08.000 --> 04:47:12.400
this grant program to make sure that it is responsive to teacher needs and that the grant

04:47:12.400 --> 04:47:16.240
has the greatest impact thank you for the opportunity to comment and we look forward

04:47:16.480 --> 04:47:19.360
continuing our collaboration with the state board of education

04:47:20.880 --> 04:47:25.600
next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now

04:47:29.600 --> 04:47:33.360
good afternoon this is shilpa ram with public advocates thank you for your presentation on

04:47:33.360 --> 04:47:38.240
this item on which our lcf equity coalition sent comments and support last week we believe that

04:47:38.240 --> 04:47:41.840
reestablishing this program and offering incentives for board certified teachers to

04:47:41.840 --> 04:47:45.760
teach and contribute to high priority schools is much needed to mitigate the widespread teacher

04:47:45.760 --> 04:47:49.440
shortage and support students in our letter we encourage the department to take the following

04:47:49.440 --> 04:47:53.840
next steps first market and publicize this program as broadly as possible and connect directly with

04:47:53.840 --> 04:47:57.440
teachers to ensure that their feedback is incorporated into the marketing materials

04:47:57.440 --> 04:48:02.240
second establish a third application process to pave the way for interested nbcps to transfer

04:48:02.240 --> 04:48:06.400
to high priority schools in the next application cycle and release details for that cycle if it's

04:48:06.400 --> 04:48:11.440
possible and finally offer robust technical assistance to lea's to support nbcps currently

04:48:11.440 --> 04:48:15.280
teaching to apply for the annual awards facilitate the transfer of nbcps to high

04:48:15.280 --> 04:48:19.360
priority schools such guidance will be invaluable to lea's in developing a strong infrastructure

04:48:19.360 --> 04:48:23.200
to welcome and support nbcps in their school communities our equity coalition will be happy

04:48:23.200 --> 04:48:28.480
to consult and offer support to the department thank you so much thank you this concludes public

04:48:28.480 --> 04:48:37.600
comment all right thank you very much a lot of enthusiasm about this new policy and i want to

04:48:37.600 --> 04:48:44.080
open this up to board discussion i see member burr you can start us off okay thank you so much

04:48:44.800 --> 04:48:51.040
i too want to offer my deep appreciation actually for bringing this program back having been there

04:48:51.040 --> 04:48:59.200
at the birth of it in 2000 under governor davis's major push to try to to provide resources to

04:49:00.400 --> 04:49:06.800
highly qualified teachers to teach in schools with the greatest need so i just but i had a

04:49:06.800 --> 04:49:11.280
question about the eligibility because i'm just a little bit confused so maybe either christin or

04:49:11.280 --> 04:49:18.000
lanique you could put the slide up that talks about it i mean it's really it's my understanding

04:49:18.000 --> 04:49:25.520
is that in this current year anyway and i think maybe next year that funding is provided for free

04:49:25.520 --> 04:49:32.320
lunch to all students and i know for years and lots of programs we've used this notion of

04:49:33.280 --> 04:49:38.560
students who qualify for free or reduced price lunch and i just i just wanted to know how that

04:49:38.560 --> 04:49:43.920
was going to work if i have a misunderstanding about who's eligible for that because again as

04:49:43.920 --> 04:49:49.520
as we've talked about this morning and in the comments that preceded me we want to make sure

04:49:49.520 --> 04:49:54.640
that this these funds are targeted to those schools most in need so i just wanted to clarify the

04:49:55.840 --> 04:50:01.040
that's not the slide but it's a slide that talks about eligibility for people to apply

04:50:01.040 --> 04:50:06.560
for the incentive funding i think maybe it's though i just saw it there briefly

04:50:07.520 --> 04:50:14.480
i think yeah with the 55 here because i read that it says it's classified as english learner

04:50:14.480 --> 04:50:20.960
foster youth or eligible for a free or reduced price meal and i didn't know again given the

04:50:20.960 --> 04:50:25.680
fact that we are providing and maybe it's a state program versus federal program

04:50:25.680 --> 04:50:31.680
but if you could clarify that for me i'd appreciate it that's a really good point um i

04:50:31.680 --> 04:50:38.640
know that the the list isn't exhaustive so obviously that everybody was eligible for the

04:50:38.640 --> 04:50:45.280
free or reduced price meals this year it's not the list doesn't include all lea's in california

04:50:45.280 --> 04:50:52.240
and it was provided to us by cindy kazanis's folks and then we went ahead and we

04:50:52.960 --> 04:51:00.320
um filtered the information to find schools with 55 percent or more so it is posted online

04:51:00.960 --> 04:51:07.920
and i don't think we have cindy on board for this item to specify for you um the free or reduced

04:51:08.560 --> 04:51:14.320
price lunch piece and i apologize but i know that the the data was provided by her office and then

04:51:14.400 --> 04:51:19.280
we um we made sure that we found which which sites were eligible from there

04:51:20.400 --> 04:51:29.680
and it it's six it's approximately 6,725 schools that are listed as high priority

04:51:33.040 --> 04:51:36.480
okay so if you could just clarify that because i think going forward especially

04:51:36.480 --> 04:51:43.200
if if if we are fortunate enough to continue providing meals to all students

04:51:43.200 --> 04:51:48.800
right i would just want to know what metric or what what we're using here to make sure that

04:51:48.800 --> 04:51:57.600
again we're we are truly targeting high priority schools thank you thank you good point member

04:51:57.600 --> 04:52:04.640
escapado i want i want to share i believe there's less than three percent national nationally

04:52:05.280 --> 04:52:12.320
student i mean teachers who have this certification and probably less in these high priority schools

04:52:12.320 --> 04:52:20.480
so we'll love to see you know later on how we've improved the percentages in these high priority

04:52:20.480 --> 04:52:28.800
schools because i agree with uh president uh darling hammon that when you have a a significant

04:52:28.800 --> 04:52:36.720
number um you know you have that multiplier effect it could really enhance the ability to decrease

04:52:36.960 --> 04:52:44.800
achievement gap so this is a great start a lot of work to be done and um i'm really really happy

04:52:44.800 --> 04:52:53.440
that this is uh up for approval yeah uh and i'll just note that when we had this program before

04:52:53.440 --> 04:52:59.600
back in the day as member burr was recalling there was a study done that found that board

04:52:59.600 --> 04:53:04.320
certified teachers were much more equitably distributed across schools in california

04:53:04.320 --> 04:53:10.880
than they were in other states so it did have a positive effect uh and so we look forward to

04:53:10.880 --> 04:53:18.880
that finding being replicated member glover woods and then member rucker just had a question in

04:53:18.880 --> 04:53:29.120
regards to incentivizing teachers for the 2022-23 school year is the current application process

04:53:29.120 --> 04:53:34.480
that's being proposed taking that into consideration i know some of the comments

04:53:34.480 --> 04:53:40.960
talked about a third application wave but if you could share a little bit about the conversation

04:53:40.960 --> 04:53:48.560
related to how we might be able to incentivize more teachers with this in high priority schools

04:53:48.560 --> 04:53:58.240
for the 2022-23 school year well i know we have a shortened application window this year

04:53:59.200 --> 04:54:06.080
because actually national board their application process closes on february 28 2022

04:54:07.040 --> 04:54:14.560
so as monique stated we're gonna try and go live with our state application as soon as the board

04:54:14.560 --> 04:54:22.880
acts maybe tomorrow hopefully and and make sure that we get things going so that they can meet

04:54:22.880 --> 04:54:28.240
the national board deadline but in the future we're gonna make sure that we open our application

04:54:28.240 --> 04:54:32.480
much earlier so there's a lot more time for teachers to apply for the next school year

04:54:34.000 --> 04:54:40.320
and we also did consult with the national board on the length of their registration and although

04:54:40.320 --> 04:54:46.480
it does seem like a tight timeline this year we believe that the registration process will allow

04:54:46.480 --> 04:54:56.240
people to be able to apply so and we didn't want to hold the program a year due to this tight

04:54:56.240 --> 04:55:01.840
timeline we wanted to give as many much opportunity as possible so we're hoping for as christin said

04:55:01.840 --> 04:55:09.120
a more robust timeline next year a longer timeline and just to be clear there's some people who may

04:55:09.120 --> 04:55:15.440
be going for board certification now and using the resources to apply others already have it

04:55:15.440 --> 04:55:24.160
and they'll be eligible for the salary incentive right correct correct um i see member rucker

04:55:25.120 --> 04:55:31.280
thank you i was going to comment on the subsidy application timeline because it is very very tight

04:55:31.280 --> 04:55:36.080
and given everything else that districts are currently being tasked to do during the same

04:55:36.080 --> 04:55:43.840
time frame it can be problematic for districts that don't already have the infrastructure in place

04:55:43.840 --> 04:55:50.080
to support a professional development project of this scope and magnitude so i'm glad to hear

04:55:50.080 --> 04:55:58.800
monique say that um there's going to be some flexibility or a longer arc in the application

04:55:59.520 --> 04:56:05.040
going down the line so i appreciate that i was also going to talk to the report that

04:56:05.760 --> 04:56:11.520
board president hammon spoke about on the equitable distribution of board certified teachers across

04:56:11.520 --> 04:56:16.640
the state of california and california was unique not only at that time but i would

04:56:17.200 --> 04:56:24.080
i would suspect and even assert that um status remains pretty much in place one of the things

04:56:24.080 --> 04:56:31.920
i did not see here in this report from you all is how you're going to monitor the net change or

04:56:31.920 --> 04:56:38.720
impact on the workforce or what the magnitude of impact for this project and this funding is going

04:56:38.720 --> 04:56:45.600
to be do you have some way or and is there a plan to come back and report to the board um you know

04:56:45.600 --> 04:56:50.720
a year down the road when you begin the new application timeline for the next funding cycle

04:56:50.720 --> 04:56:55.920
to report on what has happened where the schools are that are being funded and the types of programs

04:56:55.920 --> 04:57:02.080
or certifications that are being supported in this process we can definitely take that under

04:57:02.080 --> 04:57:08.800
advisement to bring that back and provide the um information and the data surrounding the program

04:57:08.800 --> 04:57:15.040
next year at this time yeah i think that's very important i'm surprised that that was not considered

04:57:15.040 --> 04:57:20.560
as part of this report and presentation to the board i think that's very very important to take

04:57:20.560 --> 04:57:26.960
a look at especially since we want to say that there is a magnitude of impact on having this

04:57:26.960 --> 04:57:34.000
level of expertise and this level of preparation and training in our workforce particularly in

04:57:34.000 --> 04:57:39.520
servicing the needs of underserved or students who are those high need students i think it is

04:57:39.600 --> 04:57:44.560
important to have that information and to plan forward the other thing i want to say and it's

04:57:44.560 --> 04:57:50.720
not directly related to this item so i'm going to apologize up front i want to remind uh the

04:57:51.680 --> 04:57:55.920
it's probably important especially given what we just finished doing with item with the

04:57:55.920 --> 04:58:02.160
previous item on the l cap that as the title two funds also support this program and that districts

04:58:02.160 --> 04:58:08.640
are can be encouraged to use that as write that into their planning with their l cap as well and

04:58:08.640 --> 04:58:13.920
again for the districts whose l caps i've read i have maybe this will be an opportunity as they

04:58:13.920 --> 04:58:19.840
begin updating their l caps this year that they will consider using their title two funds there

04:58:19.840 --> 04:58:25.040
are very few l caps i've read that even mention how they're using their title two funds to support

04:58:25.040 --> 04:58:29.840
professional development they just list 47 different professional development activities that never

04:58:29.840 --> 04:58:36.160
seem to go anywhere from year to year and this might be an opportunity to create some priority

04:58:36.160 --> 04:58:41.200
in the use of those title two funds to add additional support to this program as it rolls out

04:58:43.200 --> 04:58:46.240
and Kristen it's been a long time since i've seen you it's good to see you

04:58:46.240 --> 04:58:47.920

04:59:05.120 --> 04:59:12.960
and so i'll should i read the recommendation um sure uh the cde recommends that the state that

04:59:12.960 --> 04:59:19.760

education adoption of k-8 instructional materials uh and the instructional quality

05:01:41.760 --> 05:01:47.440
commission's recommendations uh the cde recommends that the state board act on the following two

05:01:47.520 --> 05:01:54.080
recommendations to adopt the two visual arts and one music program recommended by the iqc

05:01:54.800 --> 05:02:00.320
and to direct cde staff in conjunction with members of the iqc and our content review

05:02:00.320 --> 05:02:05.040
experts as needed to work with publishers to ensure that the iqc recommended edits and

05:02:05.040 --> 05:02:10.480
corrections and other publisher errata and administrative updates adopted by the sbe

05:02:10.480 --> 05:02:15.760
have been made to their revised instructional materials in order to meet the requirement of

05:02:15.760 --> 05:02:22.800
ec section 60200e the cde recommends that the state board specifically find that fewer than

05:02:22.800 --> 05:02:28.640
five programs per grade level met the adopt criteria for the adoption and this item will

05:02:28.640 --> 05:02:36.800
be presented by mike torrez of the cde mike take it away thank you so much uh president darling

05:02:36.800 --> 05:02:42.320
hamond i do want to pass it over to deputy superintendent cotton to introduce this item

05:02:46.000 --> 05:02:47.040
thank you dr torrez

05:02:51.680 --> 05:02:56.160
i'll go ahead and get started it's great to join you today as we initiate the final step in this

05:02:56.160 --> 05:03:02.480
process of the 2021 arts education adoption for instructional materials for kindergarten through

05:03:02.480 --> 05:03:07.520
grade eight i'd like to open with a quote from the california arts standards which the board

05:03:07.520 --> 05:03:14.000
adopted in january 2019 an arts education helps children and youth make sense of the world

05:03:14.000 --> 05:03:19.040
communicate their unique ideas across boundaries and discover who they are as individuals

05:03:19.680 --> 05:03:25.040
and as members of various groups students who experience a quality arts education have an

05:03:25.040 --> 05:03:30.880
opportunity to engage in complex and and nuanced thinking around meaningful work

05:03:32.000 --> 05:03:36.640
these words from elliot eisner's 2002 book the arts and the creation of mind

05:03:36.640 --> 05:03:40.880
resonate differently with me now than they did when they were printed in the front matter

05:03:41.360 --> 05:03:48.320
of the standards in 2019 today students are making sense of a different dynamic world

05:03:48.320 --> 05:03:53.360
that continues to shift in the wake of what we've seen in the two short years since the

05:03:53.360 --> 05:03:58.160
board's action now perhaps more than any time in our recent collective memory

05:03:59.120 --> 05:04:04.640
the need to communicate unique ideas across boundaries is of paramount importance not only

05:04:04.640 --> 05:04:10.160
eisner says to discover who they are but for students to lead the way in innovative approaches

05:04:10.160 --> 05:04:17.680
to complex modern problems arts education can embolden these approaches in short

05:04:17.680 --> 05:04:22.640
arts education is the meaningful work that begets the meaningful work california students will

05:04:22.640 --> 05:04:30.000
perform the arts standards provide the outcomes or the what for 21st century arts learning

05:04:30.720 --> 05:04:36.400
the guidance in the board adopted 2020 arts education framework supports the foundational

05:04:36.400 --> 05:04:42.960
instruction and assessment to quality arts learning in schools or the how and specifies

05:04:42.960 --> 05:04:48.000
the evaluation criteria for the development of high quality instructional materials that accomplish

05:04:48.000 --> 05:04:55.360
those goals today we present the findings from the 2021 arts instructional materials adoption

05:04:55.360 --> 05:04:59.680
and the recommendations outlined in the instructional quality commission's advisory report

05:05:00.320 --> 05:05:04.560
and the recommendations for visual arts and music programs for the state level adoption

05:05:05.360 --> 05:05:10.560
i have with me dr dr mike torrez the interim director of the curriculum frameworks and

05:05:10.560 --> 05:05:15.280
instructional resources division who will provide an overview of the process and the

05:05:15.280 --> 05:05:23.040
iqc's recommendations dr torrez thank you so much deputy superintendent cotton for those

05:05:23.040 --> 05:05:27.680
words of introduction and thank you to the board members for this opportunity to share with you

05:05:27.680 --> 05:05:33.440
the results of this unique adoption process the completion of this project is a testament to the

05:05:33.440 --> 05:05:39.520
work of the instructional materials reviewers the content review experts the cd staff and the

05:05:39.520 --> 05:05:46.880
iqc facilitators including commissioners fairchild costa hernandez and jarvis who together engaged in

05:05:46.880 --> 05:05:54.320
the state's first entirely virtual adoption training and deliberations i also want to recognize

05:05:54.320 --> 05:06:00.400
commission chair rustin and subject matter chair estorga almanza for their work i'll share a bit

05:06:00.400 --> 05:06:05.280
more about this later but i'd like to provide an initial thank you to all those who helped ensure

05:06:05.280 --> 05:06:10.640
this process was efficient successful and aligned with the outcomes of state-led meetings

05:06:13.280 --> 05:06:18.160
so on this slide we do have the provided cd recommendation based on the instructional quality

05:06:18.160 --> 05:06:24.240
commission's recommendation the cd does recommend that the state board act to adopt three instructional

05:06:24.240 --> 05:06:31.200
materials programs as recommended by the iqc and to direct cd staff in conjunction with members of

05:06:31.200 --> 05:06:37.840
the iqc and or content review experts as needed to work with publishers to ensure that the edits and

05:06:37.840 --> 05:06:43.440
corrections and other publisher errata and administrative updates adopted by the state board

05:06:43.440 --> 05:06:50.400
have been made to their revised instructional materials let me continue with a short recap of

05:06:50.400 --> 05:06:56.080
the steps that brought us here today the adoption of instructional materials is dictated both by

05:06:56.080 --> 05:07:02.080
statute and in the california code of regulations the next few slides will be an overview of those

05:07:02.080 --> 05:07:09.440
major milestones in that adoption process the adoption process officially began in july of 2020

05:07:09.440 --> 05:07:14.960
specifically july eight and nine when the state board of education adopted the new arts education

05:07:14.960 --> 05:07:20.800
framework the new curriculum framework plays a fundamental role in the adoption process

05:07:21.440 --> 05:07:26.080
it elaborates on the philosophical foundations that underpin the standards

05:07:26.080 --> 05:07:32.480
including the national core art standards or encast it also articulates the evaluation criteria

05:07:32.480 --> 05:07:38.880
for instructional materials at that same meeting in july the board also approved the schedule of

05:07:38.960 --> 05:07:45.680
significant events and the reviewer application for the adoption and then on september 24th

05:07:45.680 --> 05:07:51.920
2020 following the framework adoption the cd posted an initial bulletin for publishers

05:07:51.920 --> 05:08:00.400
interested in participating in the adoption on january 13 to 14 2021 the state board then

05:08:00.400 --> 05:08:05.760
appointed instructional materials reviewers and content review experts that were recommended by

05:08:05.760 --> 05:08:13.120
the instructional quality commission a total of 44 people were appointed to review the materials and

05:08:13.120 --> 05:08:20.960
that represents all five arts disciplines from dance media arts music theater and visual arts

05:08:20.960 --> 05:08:26.720
because at that time we didn't know which programs would be submitted title five regulations require

05:08:26.720 --> 05:08:31.840
a majority of instructional materials reviewers be classroom teachers in an arts discipline

05:08:32.560 --> 05:08:36.080
and per those regulations each of the review panels included at least one

05:08:36.640 --> 05:08:42.960
board appointed content review expert the panels also included board appointed curriculum leaders

05:08:42.960 --> 05:08:50.000
and community members on january 27 2021 the california department of education hosted the

05:08:50.000 --> 05:08:55.280
publisher's invitation to submit meeting where the statutory and regulatory requirements for

05:08:55.280 --> 05:09:00.880
participation in the adoption process were explained this meeting was open to the public

05:09:00.880 --> 05:09:06.720
and invited public comment ultimately five publishers submitted programs for review three

05:09:06.720 --> 05:09:14.240
of those for visual arts and two of those for music in february in february and march the cde

05:09:14.240 --> 05:09:20.720
designed an all virtual reviewer training utilizing resources and materials developed from board

05:09:20.720 --> 05:09:26.880
adopted content originally used for in-person trainings i'll talk a bit more about those

05:09:26.880 --> 05:09:32.480
trainings and subsequent deliberations later in this presentation reviewers had the privilege

05:09:32.480 --> 05:09:38.640
of being sworn in by member strauss and trained by cd staff with the support of the three aforementioned

05:09:38.640 --> 05:09:46.960
iqc facilitators may 7 2021 was the deadline for providing reviewers with access to the materials

05:09:46.960 --> 05:09:53.280
which in this adoption happened to be all digital programs may 7th also marked the beginning of the

05:09:53.280 --> 05:09:58.960
independent review period now this period of independent review lasted through july and

05:09:58.960 --> 05:10:05.840
included regular communication and timely reminders from cd project leads in this case for arts it was

05:10:05.840 --> 05:10:12.880
kyle petty the virtual deliberations began on july 19th with reviewers meeting in zoom and three

05:10:12.880 --> 05:10:19.360
panels to discuss and evaluate the five programs that were submitted these programs garnered no

05:10:19.440 --> 05:10:24.880
written public comment prior to the deliberations and during deliberations the panels took public

05:10:24.880 --> 05:10:31.040
comment twice daily after much discussion and consensus building panels formalized their

05:10:31.040 --> 05:10:39.120
recommendations and co-created an instructional material material reviewer content review expert

05:10:39.120 --> 05:10:46.080
or imr cre report of findings for each of those programs these reports were forwarded to the

05:10:46.080 --> 05:10:52.320
instructional quality commission and were also posted on the cde website i'd like to take a

05:10:52.320 --> 05:10:57.040
quick pause here on the timeline to take a moment to talk about the work that was completed by the

05:10:57.040 --> 05:11:03.040
staff in the curriculum frameworks and instructional resources division or seaford to prepare for and

05:11:03.040 --> 05:11:09.600
orchestrate this first ever virtual adoption process adoptions have until this point involved

05:11:09.680 --> 05:11:16.240
contracts with local hotels event spaces air travel event transportation on-site lodging

05:11:16.240 --> 05:11:21.600
for reviewers and the division has in the past transported materials including laptops printers

05:11:21.600 --> 05:11:27.760
projectors large screens folders reviewer materials and submitted programs to and from

05:11:27.760 --> 05:11:34.000
conference rooms each day of the training and each day of the deliberations the training involves

05:11:34.080 --> 05:11:39.600
a lot of whole group presentations individual and group reviewer work on specific board approved

05:11:39.600 --> 05:11:45.920
content and opportunities to establish a report with fellow panelists the deliberation days are

05:11:45.920 --> 05:11:52.080
full with iqc facilitators and cd staff and individual conference rooms working with reviewers

05:11:52.080 --> 05:11:58.240
to verbally and manually tally program alignment with each individual content standard and each

05:11:58.240 --> 05:12:04.240
evaluation criterion as indicated in the framework this process alone can take one to two days

05:12:04.880 --> 05:12:10.080
reviewers then draft questions deliberate on findings and ultimately co-write their reports

05:12:10.080 --> 05:12:18.560
of findings so as we all know the pandemic upended this entire in-person process and so

05:12:18.560 --> 05:12:22.480
and so with many others including our virtual state board meeting today

05:12:23.360 --> 05:12:29.200
yet the division staff worked tirelessly to ensure the process could be adapted to proceed

05:12:29.200 --> 05:12:34.960
in a virtual environment like many educators during the pandemic the project leads created

05:12:34.960 --> 05:12:40.960
google classrooms for the reviewers and used that platform to arrange materials to prepare

05:12:40.960 --> 05:12:46.800
reviewers for the training there were training requirements that reviewers completed prior to

05:12:46.800 --> 05:12:52.400
meeting in april including independent learning modules completion of the form 700

05:12:52.400 --> 05:12:58.160
and ethics training requirements they use google classroom to share sections of the framework

05:12:58.160 --> 05:13:03.120
and arts discipline standards and storm and stored the zoom meeting information

05:13:03.120 --> 05:13:09.280
and any relevant files separated in tabs by by day and each day of the training reviewers

05:13:09.280 --> 05:13:14.880
attended synchronous sessions public meetings conducted by seaford staff and engaged in

05:13:14.880 --> 05:13:20.000
asynchronous modules that extended their learning on content covered or prepared them by front

05:13:20.000 --> 05:13:25.600
loading information that would then be covered on subsequent days each of the three panels

05:13:25.600 --> 05:13:31.840
necessitated one cd staff to act as a host or technology support and another to moderate in

05:13:31.840 --> 05:13:38.000
support of the iqc facilitator additional cd staff were on hand to lend their expertise

05:13:38.000 --> 05:13:43.680
to panels on a full breadth of questions ranging from the process of adoptions to social content

05:13:43.680 --> 05:13:51.040
violations cd ensured we had backup staff for every role and staff were monitoring virtual back

05:13:51.040 --> 05:13:56.240
channels of communication which expedited requests of lead headquarter staff to jump

05:13:56.240 --> 05:14:01.680
into any zoom meeting to answer questions quickly and provide clarification as requested

05:14:02.560 --> 05:14:06.880
beyond seaford we would not have been able to execute the training and deliberations

05:14:06.880 --> 05:14:12.160
without the support of our amazing technology services division and our captioning partner

05:14:13.120 --> 05:14:18.000
reviewer materials remained in google classroom during the independent review as did access

05:14:18.000 --> 05:14:24.320
information for assigned programs the platform's synchronicity with google documents and google

05:14:24.320 --> 05:14:28.400
forms became a crucial step in the success of the deliberations process

05:14:30.800 --> 05:14:35.600
now we took what we learned from the virtual reviewer trainings that occurred in april and

05:14:35.600 --> 05:14:40.000
applied what we learned to the virtual deliberations three months later in july

05:14:40.880 --> 05:14:46.480
enter our newly developed summary tally sheet prior to day one of the deliberations week

05:14:46.480 --> 05:14:52.480
reviewers completed the initial tallies using google forms essentially each reviewer completed

05:14:52.480 --> 05:14:57.840
a form that asked if the program met or did not meet each of the listed evaluation criteria and

05:14:57.840 --> 05:15:04.640
standards the summary tally sheet then showed the ratio of yes to no then highlighting areas of

05:15:04.640 --> 05:15:11.280
consensus and disagreement among the reviewers these submissions allowed seaford staff to provide

05:15:11.280 --> 05:15:16.640
initial tally data at the outset on the first day of deliberations the process which i mentioned

05:15:16.640 --> 05:15:22.880
earlier once took one to two full days to complete the data provided a snapshot of the panel's

05:15:22.880 --> 05:15:28.880
overall findings and allowed facilitators to identify contentious points they could use to

05:15:28.880 --> 05:15:34.640
inform in-depth discussions again with a majority of reviewers submitting these initial tallies

05:15:34.640 --> 05:15:39.680
facilitators could provide a big picture perspective of the program in the eyes of the reviewers

05:15:40.480 --> 05:15:46.480
identifying these area of reviewer consensus and disagreement or what we call our hot spots

05:15:46.480 --> 05:15:51.520
helped facilitators prioritize the in-depth discussions that took place around certain

05:15:51.600 --> 05:15:59.360
standards and or criteria the result was a faster smoother review process in some cases

05:15:59.360 --> 05:16:04.800
resulting in groups initiating the report of findings drafting process much earlier than had

05:16:04.800 --> 05:16:10.160
been done in the past the sharing of a digital template for these reports also allowed seaford

05:16:10.160 --> 05:16:16.880
staff to see the documents creation in real time vastly improving the feedback process and facilitating

05:16:16.880 --> 05:16:22.160
more productive revisions we have learned a tremendous amount in this process and we know

05:16:22.160 --> 05:16:27.120
different content area adoptions yield different amounts of publisher and public interest

05:16:27.760 --> 05:16:34.080
larger adoptions like say mathematics or english language arts may be as successful if they were

05:16:34.080 --> 05:16:40.960
held entirely in a virtual setting additionally we know most educators value in-person engagement

05:16:40.960 --> 05:16:46.400
and the kinds of learning and productivity that it creates with that said most reviewers lauded

05:16:46.400 --> 05:16:52.640
this adoption and the adapted virtual process we sought feedback from reviewers and their

05:16:53.200 --> 05:16:58.000
and if we possibly sought feedback from the reviewers and their responses will not only

05:16:58.000 --> 05:17:04.080
improve our future virtual adoptions if we do consider these in the future but greatly improve

05:17:04.080 --> 05:17:10.480
our ability to recruit engage with and support professional educators without compromising the

05:17:10.480 --> 05:17:13.760
work they're doing in their local context and classrooms

05:17:17.600 --> 05:17:23.040
and so now i take us back to the timeline of events the iqc hosted a meeting to take public

05:17:23.040 --> 05:17:29.840
comment on the adoption and the reports of findings on august 17th 2021 all public comments received

05:17:29.840 --> 05:17:34.960
were submitted to the state board of education office the period between august 18th and september

05:17:35.040 --> 05:17:41.680
22nd 2021 included the required 30 day period between the public hearing and the next iqc

05:17:41.680 --> 05:17:48.400
meeting to discuss the reports of findings on september 22nd to 23rd 2021 the members of the

05:17:48.400 --> 05:17:54.880
instructional quality commission considered the recommendations from the imr cre review panels

05:17:54.880 --> 05:18:00.720
public comments and individual commission review to determine whether each program satisfied

05:18:00.720 --> 05:18:05.360
or did not satisfy the sve adopted evaluation criteria for this adoption

05:18:06.160 --> 05:18:11.520
prior to action the iqc conducted two public hearings once during the arts subject matter

05:18:11.520 --> 05:18:17.520
committee on september 22nd and another time during the full iqc meeting on september 23rd

05:18:18.240 --> 05:18:23.040
at each step in the process the commissioners heard testimony from members of the public

05:18:23.040 --> 05:18:31.120
and from publishers and now here we are on this historic day for california arts educators and

05:18:31.120 --> 05:18:36.640
students before i share the recommendations of the iqc i do want to point out that the outcome

05:18:36.640 --> 05:18:42.080
of this adoption may result in the recommendation of fewer than five of the submitted programs

05:18:42.640 --> 05:18:48.320
the sbs recommendations after consideration of the review panels reports of findings

05:18:48.400 --> 05:18:53.600
the iqc advisory report and public comment and the aspects of this timeline related to

05:18:53.600 --> 05:18:59.760
notifying the public and soliciting publisher submissions does satisfy california education code

05:18:59.760 --> 05:19:07.040
section 60200 a which allows the state board to adopt fewer than five programs when fewer than

05:19:07.040 --> 05:19:13.600
five satisfy the state board adopted arts education framework and its approved evaluation criteria

05:19:13.600 --> 05:19:15.120
for instructional materials

05:19:17.680 --> 05:19:22.480
each meeting during this process did include opportunities to hear public comment in the

05:19:22.480 --> 05:19:28.080
virtual space of the meetings this included time certain agendized times during the facilitator

05:19:28.080 --> 05:19:34.240
and reviewer training and opportunities again twice each day during the deliberations no public

05:19:34.240 --> 05:19:39.360
comment was received during the facilitator training reviewer training or during the independent

05:19:39.360 --> 05:19:44.720
review period leading up to the deliberations i'll discuss the comments received during

05:19:44.720 --> 05:19:50.960
deliberations and at the iqc meetings in in upcoming slides these documents are in the

05:19:50.960 --> 05:19:57.760
deliberations folder at fox.com so now you must be thinking dr torrez you've been talking all

05:19:57.760 --> 05:20:03.680
this time and we haven't heard any recommendations yet so here we go the recommendations of the

05:20:03.680 --> 05:20:09.760
commission are in the iqc advisory report which was provided as an attachment to this item

05:20:09.760 --> 05:20:15.040
the commission is recommending three of the five programs that were submitted for this adoption

05:20:15.040 --> 05:20:20.560
so i'll start off with the discipline of visual arts the commission recommends the programs

05:20:20.560 --> 05:20:27.360
submitted by the art of education university and davis publications inc so that would be flex

05:20:27.360 --> 05:20:33.680
curriculum and explorations in art the second edition the commission is not recommending one

05:20:33.680 --> 05:20:39.920
visual arts program the one submitted by arts attack also named program title arts attack

05:20:40.640 --> 05:20:45.680
the reasons for this recommendation are included in the report but in short the commission felt

05:20:45.680 --> 05:20:52.080
that the program did not meet several of the criteria statements in categories one two three

05:20:52.080 --> 05:20:58.320
and four and there are five categories mind you the art of education university responded to

05:20:58.320 --> 05:21:04.080
reviewer concerns raised during deliberations providing additional resources and standards

05:21:04.080 --> 05:21:10.640
alignment information arts attack and davis publications provided responses to the formal

05:21:10.640 --> 05:21:16.000
reviewer questions and discussed those responses in a session during the second day of deliberations

05:21:16.880 --> 05:21:22.160
arts attack did not provide additional comment even as the reviewers drafted a report indicating

05:21:22.160 --> 05:21:28.960
the program would not be recommended this includes opportunities at both iqc meetings davis publications

05:21:28.960 --> 05:21:33.840
has submitted publisher errata forms that have been accepted as a condition of the program's

05:21:33.840 --> 05:21:44.000
recommendation by the iqc so now let's talk about the music programs quaver ed inc for their program

05:21:44.000 --> 05:21:50.080
quaver ed music provided responses to questions posed during the deliberations it also submitted

05:21:50.080 --> 05:21:56.480
publisher errata which the iqc accepted as part of its recommendation as a reminder these components

05:21:56.480 --> 05:22:03.520
are all located in box.com the iqc is not recommending the music program submitted by opus u inc

05:22:04.960 --> 05:22:11.760
named opus u learning the reasons for this recommendation are also included in the iqc

05:22:11.760 --> 05:22:17.280
advisory report the commission felt that the program did not meet several of the criteria

05:22:17.280 --> 05:22:24.880
statements in categories one two four and five during the review panel's deliberations opus u

05:22:24.880 --> 05:22:31.440
provided responses to questions posed by the panel and was given an opportunity to address the panel

05:22:31.440 --> 05:22:38.320
regarding these concerns after those deliberations in advance of the august 17th iqc meeting the

05:22:38.320 --> 05:22:44.960
publisher did submit a lengthy letter in an attempt to review the review panel's findings

05:22:44.960 --> 05:22:51.200
which was then provided to the iqc the arts subject matter committee took the matter up first

05:22:51.200 --> 05:22:55.680
and its meeting reflected that its members carefully reviewed the publisher's letter

05:22:55.680 --> 05:23:00.960
along with the program but nonetheless concluded that the program did not meet the conditions for

05:23:00.960 --> 05:23:07.600
adoption as you know those conditions require alignment with all criteria in category one of

05:23:07.600 --> 05:23:12.880
the board adopted evaluation criteria which includes full coverage of grade level standards

05:23:13.520 --> 05:23:19.200
additionally as i noted previously the report of findings did not indicate program strengths in

05:23:19.200 --> 05:23:25.360
categories two four and five in which publishers must show strengths in order to meet adoption

05:23:25.360 --> 05:23:33.440
criteria ultimately both the arts smc and the full iqc unanimously decided not to recommend the

05:23:33.520 --> 05:23:40.000
program to the state board of education so let's talk about the iqc advisory report so in general

05:23:40.000 --> 05:23:46.400
these advisory reports include a detailed rationale for each decision to recommend or not recommend

05:23:46.400 --> 05:23:51.280
a program and includes citations in each of the five categories of the state board adopted

05:23:51.280 --> 05:23:58.080
criteria these would be citations for or citations of why it doesn't meet the report also includes

05:23:58.080 --> 05:24:03.600
the recommended edits and corrections and social content for each program it is our

05:24:03.600 --> 05:24:08.800
recommendation that these recommended edits including the iqc accepted publisher errata

05:24:08.800 --> 05:24:13.520
be made as a condition for adoption if the state board elects to adopt these materials

05:24:14.240 --> 05:24:18.560
these recommended edits came from a combination of the reviewer panel reports

05:24:19.120 --> 05:24:25.360
errata submitted by the publishers and public comment made to the iqc the commissioners considered

05:24:25.360 --> 05:24:29.280
all of these sources of input when deciding which edits to add to their recommendation

05:24:30.160 --> 05:24:35.040
at this time i'd like to on behalf of the commission thank the board for its support

05:24:35.040 --> 05:24:39.120
throughout the adoption process and we hope that the materials you adopt today

05:24:39.120 --> 05:24:45.200
will provide support for districts existing and expanding visual arts and music learning aligned

05:24:45.200 --> 05:24:51.280
with the arts education framework i'd like to take a brief moment to talk about what the next

05:24:51.280 --> 05:24:56.480
steps will be after the board takes action following this meeting there will be a 60 day

05:24:56.480 --> 05:25:02.320
timeline for publishers of adopt state board adopted instructional material programs to submit

05:25:02.320 --> 05:25:08.800
all edits and corrections to be verified by the cde since digital programs linked to the cd website

05:25:08.800 --> 05:25:14.720
do not reflect any of these edits or corrections or those errata submitted by publishers since

05:25:14.720 --> 05:25:19.760
they're in the original format that reviewers use to conduct their review the final versions

05:25:19.760 --> 05:25:24.160
of instructional materials will not be available until the state board adopted

05:25:24.160 --> 05:25:29.600
edits and corrections have been made i'd also like to speak to the recommendations herein by

05:25:29.600 --> 05:25:35.760
reminding the board and those in attendance today that local control allows school districts to

05:25:35.760 --> 05:25:41.200
choose instructional materials that are in the best interest of their students and their community

05:25:41.920 --> 05:25:48.160
these choices also apply to adopting instructional materials the state's process is designed to offer

05:25:48.160 --> 05:25:53.680
districts choices of instructional materials to match the needs of their students now not all

05:25:53.680 --> 05:26:00.000
instructional materials are alike and that is a benefit for districts lea's seeking to adopt

05:26:00.000 --> 05:26:07.040
visual arts and music materials need not restrict themselves to just the state board adopted list

05:26:07.040 --> 05:26:13.440
as they conduct their own review of instructional materials the state level review is a first level

05:26:13.440 --> 05:26:19.680
review to share with districts the materials that meet the content of the standards the framework

05:26:19.680 --> 05:26:25.920
and the criteria districts then engage in their own review of instructional materials to analyze

05:26:25.920 --> 05:26:31.920
which programs may best fit their students their programs and their pedagogical needs

05:26:34.160 --> 05:26:39.680
so to conclude the cd does recommend that the state board act to adopt the three instructional

05:26:39.680 --> 05:26:46.880
material programs recommended by the iqc and to direct cd staff to work with the iqc and content

05:26:46.880 --> 05:26:51.760
review experts as needed to work with publishers to ensure that the edits and corrections and

05:26:51.760 --> 05:26:57.440
other publisher errata and administrative updates adopted by the state board have been made to the

05:26:57.440 --> 05:27:05.520
revised instructional materials and with that i will yield the virtual floor to board president

05:27:05.520 --> 05:27:10.000
darling hammond for public comment and moderation of any questions that you may have

05:27:11.600 --> 05:27:17.520
all right thank you so much well this is a place where we need to open the floor for public hearing

05:27:18.240 --> 05:27:25.360
so i hereby open the public hearing at 251 pm and first we'll hear from any publisher who would

05:27:25.360 --> 05:27:30.720
like to comment on this item each publisher will have two minutes following comments from the

05:27:30.720 --> 05:27:35.040
publishers we will then move to comment from other members of the public who will each have

05:27:35.040 --> 05:27:41.440
one minute and we'll open the phone line for comment from publishers by calling the telephone

05:27:41.440 --> 05:27:47.760
number and using the access code provided on the slide that is shown now please provide your name

05:27:47.760 --> 05:27:52.240
and the publisher you are representing for the record and please remember to turn down the

05:27:52.240 --> 05:27:57.920
speaker volume of your computers if you are following the live feed and you have two minutes

05:27:58.640 --> 05:28:02.880

please state your name and affiliation for the record your two minutes starts now

05:28:12.800 --> 05:28:18.640
my name is scott elliway president of opus u and i wish to comment on agenda item number eight

05:28:19.200 --> 05:28:24.080
in terms of my background i've worked for and submitted successful curriculums to this state

05:28:24.080 --> 05:28:30.800
board of education via mcgraw hill and pierson i read music at oxford and i'm a fellow in music

05:28:30.800 --> 05:28:37.200
at yale university a digital k8 music curriculum entitled opus u learning was submitted the

05:28:37.200 --> 05:28:43.360
curriculum rejected california public schools typically do not purchase curriculums that are

05:28:43.360 --> 05:28:49.520
rejected by the state board of education the issue for you to consider is that a full review

05:28:50.080 --> 05:28:56.720
was not carried out without a full review a week before deliberations is not enough according to

05:28:56.720 --> 05:29:04.160
our login matrix the process favors established publishers known to reviewers via brand awareness

05:29:05.120 --> 05:29:12.320
we urge you to consider this matter failure will deter other small and unknown publishers from

05:29:12.320 --> 05:29:18.560
submitting curriculums to you in the future a level playing field is not possible should you

05:29:18.560 --> 05:29:24.160
have doubt about the written public comment that we have submitted to you some 200 pages

05:29:24.800 --> 05:29:31.600
we would recommend that you seek counsel from an independent music educator before making a final

05:29:31.600 --> 05:29:38.800
judgment on whether we should be adopted or not thank you so much for your time thank you caller

05:29:39.760 --> 05:29:46.320
we we do have one um caller from the public in the queue as well

05:29:48.240 --> 05:29:56.240
all right we'll go to that okay uh caller please state your name and affiliation for the record

05:29:56.240 --> 05:29:58.800

05:31:31.840 --> 05:31:39.840
uh virtual training and process in place i was incredibly impressed and i actually told dr

05:31:39.840 --> 05:31:47.920
torrez that i used some of the uh some of their methods and links like not not related to the

05:31:48.000 --> 05:31:54.400
arts but the ideas for my classes and google classroom because it was just so easy to maneuver

05:31:55.040 --> 05:32:02.400
and understandable i was actually in between ctc meetings at one point and so like i'd go in the

05:32:02.400 --> 05:32:08.320

05:32:39.040 --> 05:32:45.440
which i think would you know just upended everything but it just ran so smoothly and

05:32:46.000 --> 05:32:51.760
as as a person who was coming in and out i truly appreciate it you had all of the information

05:32:51.760 --> 05:32:58.640
that i needed to know what was happening and um the qc commissioners who trained reviewers

05:32:58.640 --> 05:33:05.360
and facilitated the deliberations also were incredibly impressive commissioner deborah costa

05:33:05.360 --> 05:33:12.960

05:33:12.960 --> 05:33:18.800

05:33:27.040 --> 05:33:32.880
the floor to um discussion from the board members is there any discussion

05:33:39.280 --> 05:33:46.160
uh member rucker well i want to add my compliments to the staff for the work that they did on this

05:33:46.160 --> 05:33:53.040
i've had the opportunity to participate and uh support uh textbook adoption processes for

05:33:53.120 --> 05:33:58.000
history social science math and english language arts and i had the benefit of being able to

05:33:58.000 --> 05:34:06.560
participate in the face-to-face activity but watching how accomplished the process was to

05:34:06.560 --> 05:34:13.600
support this work and do it virtually it's just impressive what was considered to improve the

05:34:13.600 --> 05:34:21.840
process and to ensure to i'm sorry to assure the engagement of all of the members who were sitting

05:34:21.840 --> 05:34:28.800
on the panels i think it is important to note there was the comment from one of the speakers

05:34:28.800 --> 05:34:36.240
in the public comment about the relationship of our reviewers and the uh uh companies that

05:34:36.240 --> 05:34:42.720
participate in the process mike could you talk a little bit about how the department actually

05:34:42.720 --> 05:34:47.840
recruits and supports small publishers to be able to participate in the process

05:34:47.840 --> 05:34:57.280
of yes that that is a great question and so we have um in the side deck as i mentioned we do

05:34:57.280 --> 05:35:03.440
have a very public process to be able to share with publishers uh the entire process of start

05:35:03.440 --> 05:35:10.320
to finish um including all the requirements um to participate in a in adoption process

05:35:10.800 --> 05:35:15.360
um that uh that notification that bulletin if you will is made public

05:35:16.160 --> 05:35:21.440
in addition to that we do have an amazing publisher liaison um who works in our division

05:35:22.160 --> 05:35:28.880
who has connections with publishers and at times sends out um sends out our communications to

05:35:28.880 --> 05:35:36.000
hundreds of publishers whether they've worked with cd or not as as you may know it may be difficult

05:35:36.000 --> 05:35:42.240
to to find out all of the the different publishers that exist out there but there is outreach to

05:35:42.240 --> 05:35:48.080
figure out who who is developing what curriculum and to be able to reach out to them and let them

05:35:48.080 --> 05:35:53.360
know that this is the process this is when it starts and this is how you go about doing it and

05:35:53.360 --> 05:35:58.160
the first the first way in is through that publisher bulletin followed by the initial meeting

05:35:58.880 --> 05:36:06.800
with with potential publishers to go over that information that's great because i do recall

05:36:06.800 --> 05:36:14.400
that there was a lot of conversation at the iqc about this process and the members were really

05:36:14.400 --> 05:36:19.440
looking forward to seeing this get underway because the development of the framework took

05:36:19.440 --> 05:36:27.920
quite some time and we were engaged being in um in developing the framework itself so i personally

05:36:27.920 --> 05:36:34.640
was looking forward to uh this process and what the outcome could be just based on listening to

05:36:34.640 --> 05:36:41.600
the conversation of the members of the iqc so mike i really do appreciate you taking the time

05:36:41.600 --> 05:36:51.040
to explain that process um i do recall when i worked on the math adoption in particular there

05:36:51.040 --> 05:36:57.600
was an opportunity of a subsidy for some small publishers to use as a way of helping them to

05:36:57.600 --> 05:37:03.760
apply and participate in the adoption process is that something that was also made available

05:37:04.320 --> 05:37:07.520
for vendors for this process as well

05:37:10.240 --> 05:37:16.000
i'm sorry i got distracted for a second can you repeat the question i said that i recall

05:37:16.000 --> 05:37:22.400
during the adoption for the math program there was an opportunity provided in the budget and

05:37:22.400 --> 05:37:28.640
by the legislature with a subsidy so that small publishers and vendors had an opportunity to be

05:37:28.640 --> 05:37:35.200
supported in their application to participate in the adoption was something similar to that also

05:37:35.200 --> 05:37:44.240
provided for the arts adoption so in in our regulations we do have a caveat to subsidize

05:37:44.240 --> 05:37:49.760
the the cost for small publishers and there are specific requirements for how a small publisher

05:37:49.760 --> 05:37:56.080
can qualify for that subsidy and we do have a history of small publishers being successful

05:37:56.080 --> 05:38:02.880
and adopted by the state board of education for history social studies for example there was a

05:38:02.880 --> 05:38:08.960
one-man operation so to speak sorry for the non-gender neutral phrase there that that did

05:38:08.960 --> 05:38:16.800
succeed in in getting adopted okay thank you very much i appreciate that thank you so much member

05:38:16.800 --> 05:38:22.080
rucker any other discussion from members of the board

05:38:26.160 --> 05:38:30.960
i think seeing none we could look for a motion

05:38:30.960 --> 05:38:47.120
all right may i make a motion you may make a motion okay all right um i was i was waiting

05:38:47.120 --> 05:38:53.200
for the screen to come back up but um let's see so i do have the motion on the screen

05:38:55.040 --> 05:38:56.400
and everyone will be able to see it

05:38:56.400 --> 05:39:04.240
but you can certainly move the recommendation while we're getting it up there okay so i move

05:39:04.240 --> 05:39:12.880
the recommendation the california department of education cd recommends um uh the act to adopt

05:39:12.880 --> 05:39:20.720
the three instructional material programs recommended by the iqc and to direct cde staff

05:39:20.800 --> 05:39:28.480
in conjunction with members of the iqc and our content review experts as needed to work with

05:39:28.480 --> 05:39:35.920
publishers to ensure that the edits and corrections and other publisher errata and administrative

05:39:35.920 --> 05:39:41.600
updates adopted by the sve have been made to their revised instructional materials

05:39:43.040 --> 05:39:49.600
very good do i have a second i will second thank you very much uh let's call the roll for the vote

05:39:51.600 --> 05:40:04.160
member son aye vice president strous yes member rucker yes member rodriguez yes member patillo

05:40:04.160 --> 05:40:16.480
brownson yes member mcquillin yes member glover woods yes member escapado yes president darlin

05:40:16.480 --> 05:40:28.880
hammond yes member burr aye member bonanca aye that's unanimous all right let's move on to

05:40:28.880 --> 05:40:34.160
agenda item nine which is a public hearing regarding the 2021 world languages adoption

05:40:34.160 --> 05:40:38.960
of k-ed instructional materials and instructional quality commission recommendations

05:40:39.520 --> 05:40:43.680
um and there are 10 programs that the cd recommends that we

05:40:44.880 --> 05:40:51.600
adopt uh accept the publisher errata not considered by the iqc and its september 2021 meaning

05:40:51.600 --> 05:40:57.200
and direct the cd staff in conjunction with members of the iqc our content review experts

05:40:57.200 --> 05:41:01.600
as needed to work with publishers to ensure that the recommended edits and correctives

05:41:02.160 --> 05:41:06.240
and any other publisher errata and administrative updates have been made to their revised

05:41:06.320 --> 05:41:12.320
instructional materials given that the criteria for the world languages adoption categorizes

05:41:12.320 --> 05:41:18.400
programs by proficiency level rather than grade level and fewer than five basic instructional

05:41:18.400 --> 05:41:23.440
materials were submitted for each proficiency level in order to meet the requirement of ec

05:41:23.440 --> 05:41:30.400
section 60200e the cd recommends that the state board specifically find that more than five

05:41:30.400 --> 05:41:36.880
programs met the criteria for the adoption and the item is presented again by mike torrez of the

05:41:36.880 --> 05:41:45.040
cd mike thank you so much again president darlin hammond and i will again pass it over to deputy

05:41:45.040 --> 05:41:53.600
superintendent cheryl cotton to introduce this item thank you dr torrez it is such a pleasure

05:41:53.600 --> 05:41:59.200
to stand before you to take the final step in this process of the 2021 world languages adoption

05:41:59.200 --> 05:42:05.120
of instructional materials for grades k through eight it is clear to me that california is ready

05:42:05.120 --> 05:42:10.400
to expand opportunities for us to unique and diverse student population to acquire world

05:42:10.400 --> 05:42:17.520
languages develop intercultural competence and become global citizens students in the 21st century

05:42:17.520 --> 05:42:22.960
with all its technological developments live in a global society people all over the world can

05:42:23.040 --> 05:42:29.200
communicate in real time organizations and businesses are multinational and new professions

05:42:29.200 --> 05:42:35.120
are continually emerging students that are successful in the 21st century will be those

05:42:35.120 --> 05:42:40.320
who are proficient in more than just the core subjects these students will be global citizens

05:42:40.320 --> 05:42:46.240
with the ability to navigate the international marketplace communicate proficiently and interact

05:42:46.240 --> 05:42:52.640
meaningfully with understanding and awareness across cultures these skills understanding

05:42:52.640 --> 05:42:58.640
speaking reading writing and signing in world languages as well as in english are essential

05:42:58.640 --> 05:43:04.480
for students to effectively contribute to state and national efforts and succeed in business

05:43:04.480 --> 05:43:10.720
research and international relations in the 21st century the world languages standards are the

05:43:10.800 --> 05:43:18.080
board that the board adopted in 2019 set lofty goals and the world languages framework

05:43:18.080 --> 05:43:22.800
this board adopted in 2020 offer up to the minute suggestions and guidance

05:43:22.800 --> 05:43:29.360
for language teachers to help their students achieve these goals and today this board is

05:43:29.360 --> 05:43:34.400
considering the adoption of instructional materials that can support local educational agencies

05:43:34.960 --> 05:43:41.360
as they promote multilingual multilingualism for all students through access to high quality

05:43:41.360 --> 05:43:48.240
well articulated world language programs today we present the findings from the 2021

05:43:48.880 --> 05:43:53.840
world languages instructional materials adoption the recommendations outlined in the instructional

05:43:53.840 --> 05:43:58.720
quality commission's advisory report and the recommendations for world languages

05:43:58.800 --> 05:44:01.200
instructional programs for state level adoption

05:44:02.000 --> 05:44:08.240
dr torus will provide an overview of the process and the iqc's recommendations dr torus

05:44:09.680 --> 05:44:15.120
thank you again deputy superintendent cotton i am i'm very pleased to join you here the completion

05:44:15.120 --> 05:44:19.760
of this project is the result of the admirable work of the educators who served as instructional

05:44:19.760 --> 05:44:25.120
material reviewers and content review experts the training and deliberations for this adoption was

05:44:25.120 --> 05:44:31.840
completed also entirely virtually and credit does go to the iqc facilitators and cd staff

05:44:31.840 --> 05:44:37.360
who innovated and worked tirelessly to ensure this adoption was successful i specifically want

05:44:37.360 --> 05:44:43.360
to take a moment to recognize iqc facilitators commissioners young fairchild and commissioner

05:44:43.360 --> 05:44:51.360
emeritus not not not it's not it's sorry i'd also like to recognize iqc chair rustin and subject

05:44:51.360 --> 05:44:57.280
matter committee chair renteria thank you to all as you helped ensure this process was efficient

05:44:57.280 --> 05:44:59.760
successful and aligned with our outcomes

05:45:03.040 --> 05:45:09.680
all right so for our recommendations the cde recommends that the state board of education act

05:45:09.680 --> 05:45:15.600
to adopt the 10 instructional material programs recommended by the instructional quality commission

05:45:16.320 --> 05:45:23.520
accept the publisher errata not considered by the iqc at its september 2021 meeting and direct cd

05:45:23.520 --> 05:45:29.760
staff in conjunction with members of the iqc and or content review experts as needed to work with

05:45:29.760 --> 05:45:36.080
publishers to ensure that the edits and corrections and other publisher errata and administrative

05:45:36.080 --> 05:45:41.280
updates adopted by the state board have been made to their revised instructional materials

05:45:41.920 --> 05:45:46.640
i'd like to provide an overview of the steps that brought us here today all of which will look

05:45:46.640 --> 05:45:54.160
very similar to you as these dates and events are very similar to the arts education presentation

05:45:54.160 --> 05:46:01.120
that you just witnessed we've referred to these internally as our dual adoptions since the cd

05:46:01.120 --> 05:46:06.400
the iqc and the state board all have conducted these two at the same time under these same

05:46:07.200 --> 05:46:13.920
restraints and same same times and same meetings so the state board of education adopted the world

05:46:13.920 --> 05:46:21.280
languages framework in july 8 through 9 of 2020 this curriculum framework reflects significant

05:46:21.280 --> 05:46:26.400
shifts in instructional approaches intended to bring about optimal performance among students

05:46:26.400 --> 05:46:31.920
in world languages classrooms the world languages standards along with the guidance provided in this

05:46:32.000 --> 05:46:38.400
framework respond to a call to action to create a more inclusive learning environment in the world

05:46:38.400 --> 05:46:43.920
languages classroom the appendices in the world languages standards and the guidance in the world

05:46:43.920 --> 05:46:50.960
languages framework call attention to research-based practices that yield evidence of positive impact

05:46:50.960 --> 05:46:57.120
on world languages acquisition chapter 13 in the world languages framework articulates the

05:46:57.200 --> 05:47:03.360
evaluation criteria for instructional materials in july the board also approved the schedule of

05:47:03.360 --> 05:47:10.640
significant events and the reviewer applications for this adoption on september 24 2020 the cd

05:47:10.640 --> 05:47:16.400
did post an initial bulletin for publishers who may be interested in participating in this adoption

05:47:18.000 --> 05:47:24.240
at the state board meeting on january 13 through 14 the sbe appointed instructional materials

05:47:24.240 --> 05:47:29.600
reviewers and content review experts that were recommended by the instructional quality commission

05:47:29.600 --> 05:47:35.360
there were a total of 42 people representing a range of world languages that were appointed to

05:47:35.360 --> 05:47:41.040
these review to review the materials now title five regulations require that a majority of

05:47:41.040 --> 05:47:46.800
instructional materials reviewers be classroom teachers in world languages and per those

05:47:46.800 --> 05:47:53.360
regulations each of the three panels included at least one board appointed content review expert

05:47:53.440 --> 05:47:58.720
subsequently the panels included board appointed curriculum leaders and community members

05:47:59.520 --> 05:48:07.040
on january 27 2021 the cd did host the publishers invitation to submit meeting where the statutory

05:48:07.040 --> 05:48:12.720
and regulatory requirements for participation in the adoption process were explained this meeting

05:48:12.720 --> 05:48:19.280
was open to the public and invited public comment ultimately there were 11 publishers who submitted

05:48:19.280 --> 05:48:26.080
programs for review now as we did for the arts education the cd designed an all virtual reviewer

05:48:26.080 --> 05:48:32.240
training week where review reviewers were trained to evaluate the submitted programs for alignment

05:48:32.240 --> 05:48:37.440
with world languages standards and the framework and evaluation criteria that were all adopted by

05:48:37.440 --> 05:48:43.520
the board reviewers were sworn in by member strauss and trained by cd staff with the support

05:48:43.600 --> 05:48:50.080
of two current and one former iqc member as facilitators before mentioned in the earlier

05:48:50.080 --> 05:48:56.480
slide the entire reviewer training was open and transparent to the public including periods of

05:48:56.480 --> 05:49:02.320
public comment daily the deadline for providing reviewers with access to the materials for the

05:49:02.320 --> 05:49:09.840
world languages adoption was may 14 2021 may 14th also marked the beginning of that independent

05:49:09.840 --> 05:49:16.080
review period now that independent review period lasted through july and included communication and

05:49:16.080 --> 05:49:22.800
reminders from cd staff at this point it was led by aaron vertiglio and currently being led by

05:49:22.800 --> 05:49:30.480
alejandro hernandez virtual deliberations began on july 26th with reviewers meeting in zoom and

05:49:30.480 --> 05:49:36.320
three panels to discuss and evaluate the 11 programs that were submitted these programs

05:49:36.320 --> 05:49:42.400
did not receive any written public comment prior to the deliberations and during the deliberations

05:49:42.400 --> 05:49:48.000
panels took public comment twice daily after much discussion and consensus building panels

05:49:48.000 --> 05:49:53.760
formalized their recommendations collaboratively created a report of findings for each program

05:49:53.760 --> 05:49:58.800
and these reports were also forwarded to the commission and were posted on the cde website

05:50:00.640 --> 05:50:04.560
so just as with the arts adoption the staff and the curriculum frameworks and instructional

05:50:04.560 --> 05:50:10.720
resources division or seaford prepared training and deliberations materials for the second ever

05:50:10.720 --> 05:50:16.720
virtual adoption process that the cd has ever conducted you might remember the first was the

05:50:16.720 --> 05:50:23.920
arts before this year adoptions have taken place at local hotels and event spaces these events

05:50:23.920 --> 05:50:30.640
involve complex contracts air travel on-site lodging the transport of all materials and equipment

05:50:30.720 --> 05:50:36.880
to the event location and oftentimes key staff would need to physically move from one room to

05:50:36.880 --> 05:50:42.880
another to share their expertise and answer any questions the attendees would have causing a delay

05:50:42.880 --> 05:50:49.520
in getting the needs of the reviewers met so as in the world the arts the world languages

05:50:49.520 --> 05:50:55.040
reviewer trainings were modified to be held virtually google classroom was used as the

05:50:55.040 --> 05:51:00.000
learning management system for the reviewers in order to arrange the materials to prepare

05:51:00.000 --> 05:51:05.840
reviewers for the training reviewers were given tasks to be completed prior to meeting in april

05:51:05.840 --> 05:51:11.120
including that independent front loading of learning modules and the required form 700

05:51:11.120 --> 05:51:16.880
and ethics training requirements the world languages standards and organized zoom information

05:51:16.880 --> 05:51:22.880
the schedules and other relevant files were also made available to reviewers in google classroom

05:51:22.880 --> 05:51:28.560
the virtual format opened up some additional opportunities so for example participants were

05:51:28.560 --> 05:51:35.760
invited to complete daily surveys which allowed cd staff to revise slides and revisit any steps

05:51:35.760 --> 05:51:44.000
in the review process in real time based on need so it was an evolving training the training involved

05:51:44.000 --> 05:51:49.120
public synchronous sessions and asynchronous modules that extended their learning on content

05:51:49.120 --> 05:51:55.040
covered each of the three included two cd staff members one to act as a host and the other to act

05:51:55.040 --> 05:52:01.040
as a support for the iqc facilitator to help moderate in addition additional cd staff were

05:52:01.040 --> 05:52:07.360
present to share their expertise answer questions on the review and deliberations process during the

05:52:07.360 --> 05:52:12.720
independent review the training materials and access information for assigned programs also

05:52:12.720 --> 05:52:20.000
remained in google classroom so this slide may look familiar because it's basically the arts

05:52:20.160 --> 05:52:26.080
um summary tally sheet but modified specifically for world languages you'll notice that

05:52:26.080 --> 05:52:31.600
instead of grade levels there are performance levels everyone involved in the virtual training

05:52:31.600 --> 05:52:37.120
that took place in april learned quite a bit from the process which allowed facilitators and staff

05:52:37.120 --> 05:52:41.840
alike to apply their learning to streamline and strengthen the virtual deliberations that took

05:52:41.840 --> 05:52:47.600
place in july in the arts presentation i shared the huge time savings from collecting initial tally

05:52:47.680 --> 05:52:53.840
data digitally which helped identify evaluation criteria where the reviewers were in agreement

05:52:53.840 --> 05:52:59.040
and areas where there needed to be focused discussion the result was a faster smoother

05:52:59.040 --> 05:53:04.400
review process in some cases resulting in groups initiating that report of findings drafting much

05:53:04.400 --> 05:53:10.320
sooner than anticipated so once consensus reached for each criteria the digital template of the

05:53:10.320 --> 05:53:14.560
reports of findings placed in the digital collaborative environment for these reports

05:53:14.640 --> 05:53:19.200
allowed seaford staff to see the document creation in real time create opportunities

05:53:19.200 --> 05:53:25.200
for instant feedback streamlined the feedback process and lastly zoom features including

05:53:25.200 --> 05:53:31.520
reactions also facilitated and expedited the process to garner reactions from the reviewers

05:53:32.400 --> 05:53:37.280
all those involved in the process have learned so much about conducting our instructional materials

05:53:37.280 --> 05:53:42.240
adoptions virtually and seaford staff specifically envisioned that conducting training and

05:53:42.320 --> 05:53:48.160
deliberations in an adoption process virtually can benefit all future adoptions including those

05:53:48.160 --> 05:53:52.720
that are likely to involve a greater number of publisher submissions while we acknowledge

05:53:52.720 --> 05:54:00.160
that many educators do value those engagement activities the reviewers just applauded the

05:54:00.160 --> 05:54:07.360
process and applauded how well things went and we additionally sought feedback from reviewers

05:54:07.440 --> 05:54:12.480
to improve future adoptions so that we can improve in real time

05:54:15.040 --> 05:54:20.880
so i'll continue now with our timeline of events the iqc did host a public meeting to take public

05:54:20.880 --> 05:54:27.040
comment on august 17th 2021 those public comments received for world languages were submitted to the

05:54:27.040 --> 05:54:34.400
state board of education the period between august 18 and september 22nd included that required 30

05:54:34.400 --> 05:54:39.920
day period between the public hearing and the next iqc meeting in order to discuss the reports

05:54:39.920 --> 05:54:46.960
of findings and then in september 22nd to 23rd the members of the iqc considered the recommendations

05:54:46.960 --> 05:54:53.280
for the imr cre review panels the public comments and individual commission review to determine

05:54:53.280 --> 05:54:59.840
whether each program satisfied or did not satisfy the sb adopted evaluation criteria for this

05:54:59.840 --> 05:55:06.640
adoption prior to taking action the iqc did conduct their public hearings one during the

05:55:06.640 --> 05:55:12.400
world languages subject matter committee on september 22nd and another during the full

05:55:12.400 --> 05:55:17.760
commission meeting on september 23rd over the entire process the commissioners provided

05:55:17.760 --> 05:55:23.440
opportunities for members of the public to provide testimony yet no testimony was provided

05:55:24.000 --> 05:55:29.600
so that brings us to this exciting day in california for world languages and the students

05:55:29.600 --> 05:55:34.000
and educators who will benefit from these instructional materials i would like to take

05:55:34.000 --> 05:55:38.080
a moment to highlight though that given the criteria for the world languages adoption

05:55:38.080 --> 05:55:44.400
how it categorizes programs by proficiency level rather than grade level fewer than five basic

05:55:44.400 --> 05:55:48.560
instructional materials were submitted for each proficiency level in order to meet the

05:55:49.440 --> 05:55:55.440
in order to meet the requirement of ed code section 60200e which allows the state board

05:55:55.440 --> 05:56:00.160
specifically find that more than five programs met the criteria for adoption

05:56:02.160 --> 05:56:08.080
as in the arts process the world languages instructional materials adoption was a very

05:56:08.640 --> 05:56:17.200
very transparent process we included opportunities to hear verbal public comment similar to in-person

05:56:17.200 --> 05:56:24.560
deliberations each meeting day included time certain agendas public comments no public

05:56:24.560 --> 05:56:29.600
comment was received during the facilitator facilitator training during the reviewer training

05:56:29.600 --> 05:56:33.200
or during the independent review period that led up to the deliberations

05:56:35.040 --> 05:56:43.520
okay here we go so we have three slides of the iqc recommendations the recommendations of the iqc

05:56:44.400 --> 05:56:50.000
um the commission is recommending 10 of the 11 programs submitted for this adoption

05:56:50.000 --> 05:56:54.880
the iqc has recommended for board approval the three instructional programs submitted

05:56:54.880 --> 05:56:58.960
by carnegie learning inc the commission recommends the three programs

05:57:00.960 --> 05:57:05.520
novice level novice level and and

05:57:05.920 --> 05:57:14.080
alta espanol para hispanohablantes novice and intermediate levels the publishers have responded

05:57:14.080 --> 05:57:19.120
to the edits and corrections and the social content findings by in general accepting the

05:57:19.120 --> 05:57:23.920
suggestions from the reviewers i will discuss publishers submitted a rather later in this

05:57:23.920 --> 05:57:32.560
presentation here i have the next four instructional programs that were reviewed the commission

05:57:32.560 --> 05:57:41.440
recommends the three programs submitted by clet usa inc alba y gael reporteros and mapas

05:57:41.440 --> 05:57:46.800
all three in the novice level the publisher has responded to the edits and corrections

05:57:46.800 --> 05:57:52.640
and the social content findings accepting the suggestions from the reviewers clet usa has also

05:57:52.640 --> 05:57:59.680
submitted a short list of publisher errata the commission is not recommending one spanish program

05:57:59.680 --> 05:58:05.040
the one submitted by rosetta stone ltd the reasons for this recommendation are included

05:58:05.040 --> 05:58:10.320
in the iqc advisory report but in short the commission felt that the program did not meet

05:58:10.320 --> 05:58:17.360
several of the criteria statements in categories one two three four and five and mind you there

05:58:17.360 --> 05:58:23.120
are five categories for the world languages adoption during the deliberations process this

05:58:23.120 --> 05:58:28.800
publisher did inform seaford staff that they would not contest the findings and opted to

05:58:28.800 --> 05:58:34.480
withdraw from participating in the process further however since the reviewers had already

05:58:34.480 --> 05:58:41.040
conducted the review and deliberations had begun we continued with the process of continuing with

05:58:41.040 --> 05:58:46.640
with deliberations creating the report of findings and having the iqc make their recommendation

05:58:49.680 --> 05:58:54.720
so now i'm going to talk about the four remaining programs all of which were recommended by the

05:58:55.600 --> 05:59:00.800
for board approval the commission recommends the four programs submitted by vista higher learning

05:59:03.600 --> 05:59:16.880
in the novice level and intermediate levels and in the novice level the publishers have responded

05:59:16.880 --> 05:59:21.360
to the edits and corrections and the social content findings by in general accepting the

05:59:21.360 --> 05:59:26.560
suggestions from the reviewers vista higher learning also submitted additional errata and

05:59:26.560 --> 05:59:33.760
suggestions for addressing the social content concerns the reviewing panel raised now in general

05:59:33.760 --> 05:59:39.760
the iqc advisory report does include detailed rationale for each decision to recommend or not

05:59:39.760 --> 05:59:46.000
recommend and include citations in each of the five categories either for or against of the state

05:59:46.080 --> 05:59:51.680
board adopted criteria the reports also include the recommended edits and corrections

05:59:51.680 --> 05:59:57.040
and social content citations for each of those programs it is cd's recommendation that these

05:59:57.040 --> 06:00:02.320
recommended edits be considered as a condition for adoption if the state board elects to adopt

06:00:02.320 --> 06:00:07.760
these materials these recommended edits came from a combination of the reports of the panels

06:00:07.760 --> 06:00:13.840
of reviewers that the board appointed to evaluate the materials comments from the public that

06:00:13.840 --> 06:00:18.880
requested that edits be made to the materials and some errata that was submitted by the publishers

06:00:19.760 --> 06:00:24.240
the commissioner is considered these sources of input when discussing and deciding which

06:00:24.240 --> 06:00:31.600
edits to add to the recommendation so i do want to take a moment to talk about publisher submitted

06:00:31.600 --> 06:00:37.120
errata publishers are not allowed to make any changes to the program after they have submitted

06:00:37.120 --> 06:00:43.120
them for review there may be some situations where the publisher has identified edits and

06:00:43.120 --> 06:00:49.200
corrections beyond what was found by the review panel this may include the correction of typos

06:00:49.200 --> 06:00:55.520
or correction of factual errors the publisher may also submit responses and possible alternate

06:00:55.520 --> 06:01:02.240
suggestions to propose edits and corrections identified by the review panel excuse me

06:01:02.240 --> 06:01:05.360
me

06:01:07.440 --> 06:01:13.680
lastly sorry the publisher may submit responses and possible suggestions for social content

06:01:13.680 --> 06:01:20.320
violations identified by the reviewers altogether these are called publisher errata so after

06:01:20.320 --> 06:01:26.240
september 2021 meeting the instructional quality commission accepted the errata of some publishers

06:01:26.960 --> 06:01:31.040
that had been submitted today we would like to request that the board act

06:01:31.040 --> 06:01:36.720
by accepting the errata submitted by the remaining publishers which include carnegie learning vista

06:01:36.720 --> 06:01:42.160
higher learning and clet usa i would like to provide a quick summary of the errata these

06:01:42.160 --> 06:01:47.280
publishers have submitted as their inclusion stands to strengthen the instructional programs

06:01:47.280 --> 06:01:53.200
the reviewer panels recommended for adoption some publishers have submitted errata addressing

06:01:53.200 --> 06:01:58.320
findings in the edits and corrections section of the reports and findings to correct typos

06:01:58.320 --> 06:02:04.640
incorrect labels headings page numbers and similar errors importantly they have included

06:02:04.640 --> 06:02:10.080
additional corrections to errors the review panels did not identify in the reports of findings

06:02:10.080 --> 06:02:15.360
and it's totally understandable that the review panels might not have caught every single error

06:02:15.360 --> 06:02:22.000
this happens during every review of instructional materials in their errata the publishers have

06:02:22.000 --> 06:02:27.280
also provided responses to some of the reviewer findings while they accept the majority of the

06:02:27.280 --> 06:02:32.800
findings in some instances they do point out that changing certain terms would simply swap

06:02:32.800 --> 06:02:37.760
one acceptable term for another acceptable term here i would like to emphasize that the

06:02:37.760 --> 06:02:44.480
world languages standards promote the acceptance of all varieties of a given language as a result

06:02:44.480 --> 06:02:50.720
making the edit to a different term might actually limit students exposure to the richness of that

06:02:50.720 --> 06:02:57.040
target language the publishers also point out that they cannot make changes on to certain content

06:02:57.040 --> 06:03:02.320
as they do not have permission to alter primary source documents once again i would like to

06:03:02.320 --> 06:03:06.480
mention that the world languages standards and the guidance in the world languages framework

06:03:06.480 --> 06:03:13.840
both embrace the use of authentic materials lastly the publishers submitted errata to address some of

06:03:13.840 --> 06:03:22.080
the social content citations identified in the reports of findings so now i'll like to i'd like

06:03:22.160 --> 06:03:28.240
to remind everyone of the steps that occur after the state board takes action today so following

06:03:28.240 --> 06:03:33.600
this meeting there will be a 60-day timeline for publishers to submit all edits and corrections to

06:03:33.600 --> 06:03:39.280
be verified by the cde the final versions of instructional materials will not be available

06:03:39.280 --> 06:03:45.040
until the state board adopted edits and corrections have been made i'd also like to remind the board

06:03:45.680 --> 06:03:50.480
and those in attendance today that local control allows school districts to choose instructional

06:03:50.480 --> 06:03:56.160
materials that will meet the diverse needs of their local educational agencies so lea is

06:03:56.160 --> 06:04:01.520
seeking world languages materials to adopt need not restrict themselves to the state board

06:04:01.520 --> 06:04:07.200
adopted list as they conduct their own review of instructional materials the state level review

06:04:07.200 --> 06:04:12.240
again is designed to be a first level review to share with districts the materials that meet the

06:04:12.240 --> 06:04:18.800
content of the standards the framework and the criteria districts then engage in their own local

06:04:18.800 --> 06:04:24.960
review of instructional materials to analyze which programs may best fit their needs so with

06:04:24.960 --> 06:04:29.360
all of that said on behalf of the commission i would like to thank the board for its support

06:04:29.360 --> 06:04:34.640
throughout the adoption process for world languages we hope that the materials you adopt today

06:04:34.640 --> 06:04:40.240
will provide support for districts and their expanding world languages programs aligned with

06:04:40.240 --> 06:04:48.080
the world languages framework i'd like to conclude with the cde recommendation the cd

06:04:48.080 --> 06:04:53.440
recommends that the state board act to adopt the 10 instructional materials programs recommended by

06:04:53.440 --> 06:05:01.440
the iqc accept the publisher errata not considered by the iqc at its september 2021 meeting and direct

06:05:01.440 --> 06:05:07.520
the cde staff in conjunction with members of the iqc and or content review experts as needed

06:05:07.520 --> 06:05:12.800
to work with publishers to ensure that the edits and corrections and other publisher errata and

06:05:12.880 --> 06:05:19.040
administrative updates adopted by the state board have been made to their revised instructional materials

06:05:21.360 --> 06:05:26.560
that concludes my presentation i now turn things back over to board president darling hamond

06:05:26.560 --> 06:05:30.960

and for the very content adopted process used kabe respectfully request the board to approve

06:06:53.120 --> 06:06:59.600
adoption of the 2021 world languages through eight instructional materials these materials

06:06:59.600 --> 06:07:04.480
are consistent with the criteria and standards established in the board's adopted curriculum

06:07:04.480 --> 06:07:11.120
frameworks and in alignment to the content standards adopted by the board the recommended

06:07:11.120 --> 06:07:15.840
instructional materials reflect innovative practices grounded in the use of the target

06:07:15.840 --> 06:07:21.600
language that are often faced and guided by the goals contained in the world language standards

06:07:22.240 --> 06:07:28.640
if you can't educators teaching world languages and our students will now have updated instructional

06:07:28.640 --> 06:07:41.520
materials for which they have rated for thank you thank you caller this concludes public comment

06:07:43.760 --> 06:07:49.600
very good um given that there's no other public comment i hereby close the public

06:07:49.600 --> 06:07:54.960
hearing at 3 32 p.m and we'll now begin board discussion and i'd like to ask our liaison

06:07:54.960 --> 06:08:02.640
member glover woods if she would like to make some initial comments yes i would very briefly

06:08:02.640 --> 06:08:09.600
first would like to thank the seaford staff and other cde staff that organized a very thoughtful

06:08:09.600 --> 06:08:17.360
and a very organized um review and deliberation process of the time and sacrifice that was given

06:08:17.360 --> 06:08:26.960
by the content reviewers the expert reviewers as well as the iqc just really allowed for us to

06:08:26.960 --> 06:08:35.600
have in front of us 10 very strong instructional material sets for students that are engaging in

06:08:35.600 --> 06:08:42.320
the world languages so very appreciative of that and i do have to say having participated in this

06:08:42.320 --> 06:08:49.280
process for reading language arts over 10 years ago nothing was missed by the transfer to virtual

06:08:50.320 --> 06:08:57.520
every conversation that took place again was very thoughtful and very well thought out which would

06:08:57.520 --> 06:09:04.240
be the same as thoughtful i'm sure so again thank you so very much to everyone who participated in

06:09:04.240 --> 06:09:10.320
the process and look forward to any additional board comment you may have discovered a new way

06:09:10.320 --> 06:09:17.840
to do these reviews a more economical fashion to do them i have with hands raised member rucker

06:09:17.840 --> 06:09:24.960
member strouse and member escapado member rucker first of all i want to thank you even though this

06:09:24.960 --> 06:09:31.840
is the second hearing and the second process on adoption that we covered and you essentially

06:09:31.840 --> 06:09:38.000
covered the basic outline of the process i do want to thank you for taking the time to take us again

06:09:38.080 --> 06:09:45.200
through this process world languages has garnered a lot of attention in the education community and

06:09:45.200 --> 06:09:51.920
for me sitting at the iqc meeting along with my state board colleagues and being led through this

06:09:51.920 --> 06:09:58.800
particular adoption it was very exciting to hear teachers talk about their own learning on world

06:09:58.800 --> 06:10:04.880
languages students and how it translated into what they think about and look at with their own

06:10:04.880 --> 06:10:09.600
students who are english learners and for the teachers who are language

06:10:09.600 --> 06:10:15.600
instructors what it meant and how it changes what they look at language learning instruction

06:10:16.320 --> 06:10:22.000
so it was very enjoyable to me to sit and listen to the conversation and to watch this process

06:10:22.000 --> 06:10:29.040
unfold and i'm so happy to see this come to fruition now and we're ready to move this process

06:10:29.280 --> 06:10:34.960
so thank you and thank the seaford staff for all the work that they did to carry this forward and

06:10:34.960 --> 06:10:43.760
move this process awesome um vice president strouse so um mike i just want to thank you

06:10:43.760 --> 06:10:50.720
for a really thorough presentation to go through all the steps it's very complex i think the seaford

06:10:50.720 --> 06:10:56.880
team as everyone has said did an amazing job but to think about all the things that you plan for

06:10:56.880 --> 06:11:01.600
i've been in the materials adoptions when you went from room to room and to see that you could

06:11:01.600 --> 06:11:07.840
go from breakout room to breakout room that you could do a survey and get people's initial

06:11:07.840 --> 06:11:13.200
reactions and give everyone an opportunity to follow the process carefully i just want to

06:11:13.200 --> 06:11:19.200
thank you and the team that led this work and for all the reviewers who volunteer so much time to

06:11:19.200 --> 06:11:23.280
review it i think it will make a tremendous difference for students in california as we

06:11:23.280 --> 06:11:28.400
go forward and we know that districts then will have to go through their own process to

06:11:28.400 --> 06:11:33.760
now evaluate materials and so i just want to thank you mike for that thorough presentation

06:11:33.760 --> 06:11:43.280
and for the process thank you very much uh and member escapado i appreciate the presentation and

06:11:43.280 --> 06:11:50.160
just want to share that is more than transmitting language is transmitting culture and i've seen

06:11:50.160 --> 06:11:58.080
firsthand when students of variety of races learn a language there's a stickiness factor where

06:11:58.080 --> 06:12:08.320
they interconnect and it really breaks so many racial barriers uh so i just applaud your effort

06:12:08.320 --> 06:12:16.240
it's it has made a significant effect in the lives of so many children and and created

06:12:16.240 --> 06:12:22.080
has created more racial harmony which is more we need more of that right i just want to add one

06:12:22.080 --> 06:12:28.720
one one thing is that i know we focus more on spanish and french when you look at the

06:12:28.720 --> 06:12:34.880
dual immersion programs in our state yes spanish ranks one but second is mandarin i think french

06:12:34.880 --> 06:12:40.640
is third or fourth so hopefully in the future there might be some great publishers that

06:12:41.280 --> 06:12:48.240
uh may have mandarin as as a framework for instruction so hopefully i will be able to

06:12:48.240 --> 06:12:55.840
look at that material as well thank you i just want to sort of add on to these comments and say

06:12:56.560 --> 06:13:02.720
first of all um you know we know so much now about the neuroscience of brain development

06:13:02.720 --> 06:13:09.520
and today we've been talking about music art and world language adoptions which at your moments in

06:13:09.600 --> 06:13:15.200
time have been considered sort of frills in the curriculum but they are fundamental to the

06:13:15.200 --> 06:13:21.680
development of the brain in fact symbol systems music and art world languages all develop neuron

06:13:21.680 --> 06:13:28.240
connections and the neurons that you know fire together wire together as they say and make us

06:13:28.240 --> 06:13:34.240
you know generally more flexible in our thinking more intelligent as well as more connected to

06:13:34.240 --> 06:13:40.560
other human beings as you said member escapado and more connected culturally so it's a very

06:13:40.560 --> 06:13:46.640
important set of adoptions i hope that these are going to be central to students learning

06:13:46.640 --> 06:13:55.280
experiences in school now just one little fact on that point they found that when people have

06:13:55.280 --> 06:14:04.000
more than one language that even when there is in autopsies evidence of things like alzheimer's

06:14:04.320 --> 06:14:11.120
those who have multiple languages actually show the signs of that kind of degenerative

06:14:11.120 --> 06:14:15.440
disease five years later than people who are monolingual because they've got that many more

06:14:16.000 --> 06:14:22.960
connections wired with which to do their mental activity and so as a former musician myself and

06:14:22.960 --> 06:14:29.120
someone who has many languages in the family i'm thrilled that we're you know really putting this

06:14:29.120 --> 06:14:36.640
kind of work in these kind of materials you know available to our schools the other thing i just

06:14:36.640 --> 06:14:42.240
like to note is that many of us have talked about how you know we shouldn't lose the innovations

06:14:42.240 --> 06:14:46.560
that have occurred during the pandemic i think this might be one of the innovations that occurred

06:14:46.560 --> 06:14:51.920
during the pandemic and that we ought to be mindful of taking advantage of what you've been

06:14:51.920 --> 06:14:58.000
able to accomplish here in a very complicated public process that may serve us in good stead

06:14:58.640 --> 06:15:04.720
as we go forward if there's no more board discussion i see no other hands raised

06:15:04.720 --> 06:15:11.680
i think we can ask for a motion oh member mcclellan did your hand go up yeah i'm sorry to drag

06:15:11.680 --> 06:15:17.280
this out that's okay but you know i i appreciate the presentation also in what was stated about

06:15:17.280 --> 06:15:24.400
local efforts to accommodate languages offered in each area i mean we're such a diverse state

06:15:24.960 --> 06:15:29.200
in our neck of the woods up here in our high schools we offer the urock language

06:15:30.000 --> 06:15:35.360
it's articulated to meet the world language criteria in four of our major high schools

06:15:35.360 --> 06:15:41.440
along with the talawa language so that local emphasis is so important and what was said

06:15:41.440 --> 06:15:48.320
earlier about communicating culture and helping us to bridge the divides of better understanding

06:15:48.400 --> 06:15:54.240
with our families and our communities is so important so it's such an important area so i

06:15:54.240 --> 06:16:00.320
appreciate the presentation and all the work thank you thank you for that very important comment

06:16:01.920 --> 06:16:05.840
if there are no other comments i'll invite a motion

06:16:07.920 --> 06:16:13.920
i'd like to make the motion i move that we accept cde's recommendation which is inclusive of

06:16:13.920 --> 06:16:20.080
adopting the 10 instructional materials and the publisher errata that was not considered by the

06:16:20.080 --> 06:16:26.400
iqc at the september meeting as well as the process outlined on the slide to address any

06:16:26.400 --> 06:16:32.080

06:19:59.640 --> 06:20:02.640

Okay, so now we'll take up the regular consent items, 10 through 15.

06:20:09.400 --> 06:20:14.680
Because we have two recusals, we will need to take the consent items up in two votes.

06:20:14.680 --> 06:20:20.640
First item 10, Member Sun and Member Strauss, I understand you must recuse yourselves from

06:20:20.640 --> 06:20:21.640
this item.

06:20:21.640 --> 06:20:23.960
And they seem to be gone.

06:20:24.720 --> 06:20:27.840
Please turn off your cameras as they did.

06:20:27.840 --> 06:20:32.000
And after Brooks calls the roll, they can come back in.

06:20:32.000 --> 06:20:37.080
We'll now open the phone line for the queue for public comment on consent items 11 through

06:20:37.080 --> 06:20:38.680
15.

06:20:38.680 --> 06:20:43.320
Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item may do so by calling the telephone

06:20:43.320 --> 06:20:48.640
number and using the access code provided on the slide that is shown now.

06:20:48.640 --> 06:20:53.460
We encourage you, if you are calling, to state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:20:53.460 --> 06:20:58.060
If the item you're commenting on, remember to turn down the speaker volume on your computers

06:20:58.060 --> 06:21:02.740
if you're following the live feed and speak for one minute each.

06:21:02.740 --> 06:21:04.980
Are there any public comments?

06:21:04.980 --> 06:21:07.820
There are no public comments at this time.

06:21:07.820 --> 06:21:08.820
Okay.

06:21:08.820 --> 06:21:13.860
Given that there's no further public comment, I'll ask for a motion on consent items 11

06:21:13.860 --> 06:21:14.860
to 15.

06:21:14.860 --> 06:21:20.220
I would move approval of the consent.

06:21:20.220 --> 06:21:21.220
Thank you.

06:21:21.220 --> 06:21:22.220
May I have a second?

06:21:22.260 --> 06:21:24.260
Excuse me, member Darling-Hammond.

06:21:24.260 --> 06:21:25.260
This was my mistake.

06:21:25.260 --> 06:21:30.740
We're just taking a vote on consent item 10 right now because that was my mistake in the

06:21:30.740 --> 06:21:31.740
script.

06:21:31.740 --> 06:21:32.740
I'm sorry.

06:21:32.740 --> 06:21:33.740
Yeah.

06:21:33.740 --> 06:21:34.740
Okay.

06:21:34.740 --> 06:21:36.460
So first we're going to ask for a motion on item 10.

06:21:36.460 --> 06:21:40.820
I will amend my motion to move a motion on item 10.

06:21:40.820 --> 06:21:41.820
Okay.

06:21:41.820 --> 06:21:44.140
That was a friendly amendment.

06:21:44.140 --> 06:21:45.980
And from you to you.

06:21:45.980 --> 06:21:49.500
Is there a second?

06:21:49.500 --> 06:21:50.820
I'll second.

06:21:50.820 --> 06:21:51.820
Thank you so much.

06:21:52.420 --> 06:21:57.740
Now we'll go ahead and take a roll call vote.

06:21:57.740 --> 06:21:58.740
Member Rucker.

06:21:58.740 --> 06:21:59.740

06:21:59.740 --> 06:22:00.740
Member Rodriguez.

06:22:02.740 --> 06:22:03.740
Yes.

06:22:03.740 --> 06:22:04.740
Member McQuillan.

06:22:04.740 --> 06:22:05.740
Yes.

06:22:05.740 --> 06:22:06.740
Member Glover-Woods.

06:22:06.740 --> 06:22:07.740
Yes.

06:22:07.740 --> 06:22:08.740
Member Escobedo.

06:22:08.740 --> 06:22:09.740
Yes.

06:22:09.740 --> 06:22:10.740
President Darling-Hammond.

06:22:10.740 --> 06:22:11.740
Yes.

06:22:11.740 --> 06:22:12.740
Member Burr.

06:22:12.740 --> 06:22:13.740
Aye.

06:22:13.740 --> 06:22:14.740
Member Bonacca.

06:22:14.740 --> 06:22:15.740
Aye.

06:22:15.740 --> 06:22:16.740
Thank you.

06:22:17.380 --> 06:22:18.380
Member Burr.

06:22:18.380 --> 06:22:19.380
Aye.

06:22:19.380 --> 06:22:20.380
Member Bonacca.

06:22:20.380 --> 06:22:21.380
Aye.

06:22:21.380 --> 06:22:22.380
Motion passes.

06:22:22.380 --> 06:22:26.380
All right.

06:22:26.380 --> 06:22:32.180
And we can welcome back Vice President Strauss and Member Son.

06:22:32.180 --> 06:22:35.180
There we go.

06:22:35.180 --> 06:22:36.180
You didn't miss much.

06:22:36.180 --> 06:22:42.980
Now we're going to go on to public comments for consent items 11 to 15.

06:22:42.980 --> 06:22:46.100
And we'll encourage anyone who's calling in for public comment.

06:22:46.100 --> 06:22:50.740
Let's put that slide back up to state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:22:50.740 --> 06:22:53.940
Use that phone number and access code on the slide.

06:22:53.940 --> 06:22:56.220
Please state which item you're commenting on.

06:22:56.220 --> 06:22:59.260
Remember to turn down the speaker volume on your computers.

06:22:59.260 --> 06:23:05.100
If you are following the live feed and speak for one minute each, are there public comments

06:23:05.100 --> 06:23:07.300
on items 11 to 15?

06:23:07.300 --> 06:23:11.500
Yes, we do have one in public comment in the queue.

06:23:11.500 --> 06:23:15.100
Caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:23:15.100 --> 06:23:17.100
Your time starts now.

06:23:17.100 --> 06:23:20.740
Good afternoon.

06:23:20.740 --> 06:23:24.300
My name is Michael Jubba and I'm a classroom teacher representing the California Teachers

06:23:24.300 --> 06:23:27.100
Association commenting on item 13.

06:23:27.100 --> 06:23:32.780
The CTA would like to express our continued concerns with the funding determination process

06:23:32.780 --> 06:23:34.780
for non-classroom-based charters.

06:23:34.780 --> 06:23:40.580
The process is broken and does not provide the level of transparency that's needed for

06:23:40.580 --> 06:23:45.260
the commissioners of the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools nor the members of the

06:23:45.260 --> 06:23:52.500
State Board of Education to provide appropriate public oversight on these funding determinations.

06:23:52.500 --> 06:23:58.780
Moratorium on new NCBs has been extended until 2025 and this is a time for the California

06:23:58.780 --> 06:24:04.780
Department of Ed and the State Board of Ed to begin to renew and update the regulations

06:24:04.780 --> 06:24:06.900
that govern this process.

06:24:06.900 --> 06:24:08.700
Thank you for your time.

06:24:08.700 --> 06:24:09.900
Thank you, Caller.

06:24:09.900 --> 06:24:13.700
This concludes public comment.

06:24:13.700 --> 06:24:17.380
Thank you very much.

06:24:17.380 --> 06:24:21.340
Given that there's no further public comment, I will ask if there is a motion on consent

06:24:21.340 --> 06:24:23.380
items 11 to 15.

06:24:23.380 --> 06:24:24.380
Do I have a motion?

06:24:24.380 --> 06:24:29.060
I move approval of the consent items.

06:24:29.060 --> 06:24:31.660
Second it.

06:24:31.660 --> 06:24:33.380
Thank you.

06:24:33.380 --> 06:24:36.900
We'll now hold a roll call vote.

06:24:36.900 --> 06:24:39.340
Brooks, call the roll.

06:24:39.340 --> 06:24:41.100
Member Sun.

06:24:41.100 --> 06:24:42.100
Aye.

06:24:42.100 --> 06:24:44.100
Vice President Strauss.

06:24:44.100 --> 06:24:45.100
Aye.

06:24:45.100 --> 06:24:46.100
Member Rucker.

06:24:46.100 --> 06:24:47.100
Yes.

06:24:47.100 --> 06:24:48.100
Member Rodriguez.

06:24:48.100 --> 06:24:49.100
Member Petillo-Brownson.

06:24:49.100 --> 06:24:50.100
Yes.

06:24:50.100 --> 06:24:51.100
Member McQuillan.

06:24:51.100 --> 06:24:52.100
Yes.

06:24:52.100 --> 06:24:53.100
Member Glover-Woods.

06:24:53.100 --> 06:24:54.100
Yes.

06:24:54.100 --> 06:24:55.100
Member Escobedo.

06:24:55.100 --> 06:24:56.100
Yes.

06:24:56.100 --> 06:24:57.100
President Darlin-Hammond.

06:24:57.100 --> 06:24:58.100
Yes.

06:24:58.100 --> 06:24:59.100
Member Burr.

06:24:59.100 --> 06:25:00.100
Aye.

06:25:00.100 --> 06:25:01.100
Member Bonanca.

06:25:01.100 --> 06:25:02.100
Aye.

06:25:02.100 --> 06:25:03.100
Member Rodriguez.

06:25:03.100 --> 06:25:04.100
Aye.

06:25:04.100 --> 06:25:05.100
Motion passes unanimously.

06:25:05.100 --> 06:25:06.100
All right.

06:25:06.100 --> 06:25:07.100
Agenda item 11.

06:25:07.100 --> 06:25:33.460
is our state board priorities item and we're reopening item one to take action on the preliminary

06:25:33.460 --> 06:25:40.180
report of actions, the draft September 2021 meeting minutes, the SBE screening committee

06:25:40.180 --> 06:25:47.020
recommendations for appointments to the ACCS, CPEG, and IQC, and to report on our liaison

06:25:47.020 --> 06:25:49.020
assignments.

06:25:49.020 --> 06:25:53.900
The first of those is the SBE draft preliminary report of actions and minutes for the September

06:25:53.900 --> 06:25:58.100
9th, 2021 meeting.

06:25:58.100 --> 06:26:03.020
While we're waiting for any members of the public to call in, I do have a motion from

06:26:03.020 --> 06:26:08.460
a board member or may I have a motion from a board member to approve the September 9th,

06:26:08.460 --> 06:26:14.940
2021 state board of education draft preliminary report of action meeting minutes.

06:26:14.940 --> 06:26:19.620
That was a long-winded way of asking for a motion.

06:26:19.620 --> 06:26:22.300
I move that we accept the minutes.

06:26:22.300 --> 06:26:23.300
Thank you very much.

06:26:23.300 --> 06:26:24.300
Can I have a second?

06:26:24.300 --> 06:26:25.820
I will second that.

06:26:25.820 --> 06:26:26.820
Thank you very much.

06:26:26.820 --> 06:26:30.140
Are there any public comments?

06:26:30.140 --> 06:26:32.980
There is one in public comment.

06:26:32.980 --> 06:26:36.540
Caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:26:36.540 --> 06:26:38.340

06:26:38.340 --> 06:26:46.220
My name is David Page and I'm calling on behalf of parents and teachers and community members

06:26:46.220 --> 06:26:50.580
of Lincoln High School community in San Diego Unified School District.

06:26:50.580 --> 06:26:54.700
On the 325 of 21, we filed a complaint directly.

06:26:54.700 --> 06:26:57.220
Excuse me.

06:26:57.220 --> 06:27:02.580
We'll need you to call back during the final public comment period.

06:27:02.580 --> 06:27:07.700
You can you may only speak to the item at hand at this time.

06:27:07.700 --> 06:27:08.700
Thank you.

06:27:08.700 --> 06:27:10.700
Thank you.

06:27:10.700 --> 06:27:13.860
All right.

06:27:13.860 --> 06:27:15.900
Any further public comment?

06:27:15.900 --> 06:27:17.980
No, no more.

06:27:17.980 --> 06:27:19.540
No more public comment.

06:27:19.540 --> 06:27:23.020
Okay, well now hold a roll call vote.

06:27:23.020 --> 06:27:25.820
Brooks, can you please call the roll?

06:27:25.820 --> 06:27:26.820
Member Sun.

06:27:26.820 --> 06:27:27.820
Aye.

06:27:27.820 --> 06:27:28.820
Vice President Strauss.

Terrific.

06:27:50.820 --> 06:28:09.940
We'll go on to the State Board Screening Committee recommendations for appointments to the ACCS,

06:28:09.940 --> 06:28:11.940
the CPEG and the IQC.

06:28:11.940 --> 06:28:14.620
We got a lot of acronyms here.

06:28:15.500 --> 06:28:20.180
If we could get the public's comment slide up again, we will open the phone line for

06:28:20.180 --> 06:28:22.500
public comment.

06:28:22.500 --> 06:28:27.120
And members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item may do so by calling

06:28:27.120 --> 06:28:32.500
the telephone number and using the access code provided on the slide that is shown now.

06:28:32.500 --> 06:28:36.540
And while we're waiting for any members of the public to call in, I'll ask Vice President

06:28:36.540 --> 06:28:41.500
Strauss, who has chaired this year's process, to share the recommendations from the State

06:28:41.500 --> 06:28:46.060
Board Screening Committee regarding appointments to the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools,

06:28:46.060 --> 06:28:52.060
the California Practitioners Advisory Group, and the Instructional Quality Commission.

06:28:52.060 --> 06:28:53.660
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

06:28:53.660 --> 06:29:01.260
So first I have to completely thank our screening committee members, Ting Sung and Cynthia Glover-Woods.

06:29:01.260 --> 06:29:08.000
We all together, we reviewed almost 100 applications for the different screenings that we did.

06:29:08.000 --> 06:29:11.720
We do have two more screenings that are getting posted, one for the Advisory Commission on

06:29:11.720 --> 06:29:16.520
Special Ed and one for the two positions on Instructional Quality Commission.

06:29:16.520 --> 06:29:19.560
But we reviewed the applications.

06:29:19.560 --> 06:29:23.840
We had a separate meeting to decide who we were going to interview and then separate

06:29:23.840 --> 06:29:27.060
interviews for each of the commissions.

06:29:27.060 --> 06:29:33.080
Let me just say, since we've gone remote, the interviews are done by Zoom now, not by

06:29:33.080 --> 06:29:34.440
telephone.

06:29:34.440 --> 06:29:38.560
And it is really actually, this is an improvement in the process, because we can see people,

06:29:38.560 --> 06:29:42.820
we can talk and introduce ourselves, it felt really personal and connected.

06:29:42.820 --> 06:29:46.360
So with that, I'm going to give you a summary of our recommendations.

06:29:46.360 --> 06:29:51.180
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools, this is an addendum that's been posted.

06:29:51.180 --> 06:29:56.920
We are recommending a reappointment to a two-year term and as chair of ACCS, as specified

06:29:56.920 --> 06:30:01.480
in the addendum, Mike Walsh, currently a member of the Butte County Board of Education.

06:30:01.480 --> 06:30:04.120
He's the co-founder and CEO of Beacon Results.

He represents governing boards of school districts.

06:30:07.320 --> 06:30:11.920
We're recommending reappointment of a one-year term, as specified in the addendum, for Gail

And appointed for a two-year term, as specified in the addendum, Derek King, superintendent

06:30:35.960 --> 06:30:40.200
of Excelsior Charter Schools, representing charter schools.

06:30:40.200 --> 06:30:42.880
So that's for ACCS.

06:30:42.880 --> 06:30:47.240
For the California Practitioners Advisory Group, we're recommending reappointment for

06:30:47.240 --> 06:30:48.540
a one-year term.

06:30:48.540 --> 06:30:53.160
We have four reappointments, as specified in the addendum, Bootsy Battleholt, teacher

06:30:53.160 --> 06:30:58.240

governing board, and he's representing members of local school boards.

06:32:03.600 --> 06:32:08.280
Those three, those four were for a three-year term.

06:32:08.880 --> 06:32:11.680
Now, these two are represented for a two-year term.

06:32:11.680 --> 06:32:18.200
We tried to balance the terms, so we rotate some off each year, as specified in the addendum.

06:32:18.200 --> 06:32:24.160
Sonia Rody Boonchoy, he's the associate superintendent of instructional services for Davis Joint

06:32:24.160 --> 06:32:25.400

06:32:25.680 --> 06:32:28.280
He represents superintendents and other administrators.

She's representing members of local school boards.

06:32:41.160 --> 06:32:43.280
So we had a lot of appointments to CPAC.

06:32:43.520 --> 06:32:48.200
For the Instructional Quality Commission, we appointed for a four-year term, as specified

06:32:48.200 --> 06:32:52.080
in the addendum, Marcy Winnower, an instructional support teacher.

06:32:52.080 --> 06:32:57.720

She's from Northgate High School, Mount Diablo Unified School District, representing students.

06:33:10.640 --> 06:33:17.440
So those are the recommendations by the screening committee for appointments to the

06:33:17.440 --> 06:33:18.160
commissions.

06:33:20.680 --> 06:33:21.680
That was a mouthful.

06:33:22.440 --> 06:33:23.560
It was a lot of work.

06:33:24.360 --> 06:33:24.880
A lot of work.

06:33:25.160 --> 06:33:30.360
I want to thank the members of those committees and ask if Member Glover-Woods or Member

06:33:30.360 --> 06:33:35.920
Son may also want to add any comments since they participated in all of that.

06:33:36.560 --> 06:33:43.040
Well, I think that Vice Chair Stroud is amazing, getting us through all of those interviews.

06:33:43.040 --> 06:33:48.360
She's got the process down and she got us through all of the screening of the paperwork

06:33:48.360 --> 06:33:50.200
and the interviews.

06:33:50.880 --> 06:33:53.440
So thank you very much, Vice Chair Stroud.

06:33:53.440 --> 06:34:00.320
And also just looking at the applicants, I think that it's wonderful to see that educators

06:34:01.280 --> 06:34:06.760
from throughout California and their interest in serving on these committees.

06:34:06.760 --> 06:34:09.440
And so it was a fabulous experience.

06:34:09.440 --> 06:34:14.080
It's my second year in a row and enjoyed both times thoroughly.

06:34:14.080 --> 06:34:14.560
Thank you.

06:34:15.800 --> 06:34:16.800
Member Glover-Woods.

06:34:17.760 --> 06:34:23.120
Just to thank you to everyone who applied for all of the different commissions.

06:34:23.120 --> 06:34:27.520
Just really appreciate the time that was put forward in completing applications and for

06:34:27.520 --> 06:34:29.440
those who participated in the interviews.

06:34:30.320 --> 06:34:35.840
Again, just very great educators and community members that have an interest to serve at

06:34:35.840 --> 06:34:36.440
this level.

06:34:38.080 --> 06:34:38.680
Terrific.

06:34:39.480 --> 06:34:42.440
Are there any clarifying questions before we go to public comment?

06:34:45.240 --> 06:34:47.760
Seeing none, we'll see if there's any public comment.

06:34:48.640 --> 06:34:50.440
There are no public commenters.

06:34:52.360 --> 06:34:53.080
All right.

06:34:53.080 --> 06:34:57.720
So we can see if there's any other board discussion.

06:34:59.320 --> 06:35:01.240
And if not, I'll invite a motion.

06:35:02.520 --> 06:35:09.880
So I move approval of the screening committee appointments and reappointments to the ACCS,

06:35:09.880 --> 06:35:11.240
CPAC and IQC.

06:35:12.200 --> 06:35:13.080
Thank you very much.

06:35:13.080 --> 06:35:14.280
And do I have a second?

06:35:14.920 --> 06:35:15.560
I'll second.

06:35:16.280 --> 06:35:17.160
Thank you very much.

06:35:17.720 --> 06:35:19.320
Any further board discussion?

06:35:19.320 --> 06:35:23.240
I'm instructed to ask you to raise your hand in the participant panel of Zoom.

06:35:23.960 --> 06:35:27.240
So this is a different way of doing this.

06:35:27.240 --> 06:35:33.560
I'm not sure why we're varying our process, but I'm trying to find out how to raise my

06:35:33.560 --> 06:35:34.040
hand too.

06:35:36.040 --> 06:35:36.840
If you are.

06:35:39.400 --> 06:35:41.080
Okay, we're all here.

06:35:41.080 --> 06:35:44.360
And, Brooks, it says you still have to call the roll.

06:35:44.360 --> 06:35:45.160
Yeah, that's right.

06:35:45.160 --> 06:35:52.680
All right.

06:35:52.680 --> 06:35:55.000
So everybody's learning how to use Zoom.

06:35:55.000 --> 06:35:55.720
So that's good.

06:35:57.800 --> 06:35:59.000
There's a lesson every day.

06:35:59.480 --> 06:36:00.120
Member Sun.

06:36:00.920 --> 06:36:01.240
Aye.

06:36:02.120 --> 06:36:02.920
President Strauss.

06:36:03.800 --> 06:36:04.040
Aye.

06:36:04.680 --> 06:36:05.400
Member Rucker.

06:36:06.280 --> 06:36:06.520
Yes.

06:36:07.240 --> 06:36:08.200
Member Rodriguez.

06:36:09.240 --> 06:36:09.560
Aye.

06:36:10.200 --> 06:36:11.400
Member Paquilla Brownson.

06:36:12.440 --> 06:36:12.680
Yes.

06:36:13.320 --> 06:36:14.200
Member McQuillan.

06:36:15.320 --> 06:36:15.720
Yes.

06:36:16.280 --> 06:36:17.240
Member Glover-Woods.

06:36:18.360 --> 06:36:18.680
Yes.

06:36:19.400 --> 06:36:20.280
Member Escobedo.

06:36:21.560 --> 06:36:21.880
Yes.

06:36:22.440 --> 06:36:23.480
President Darlene Hammond.

06:36:24.520 --> 06:36:24.840
Yes.

06:36:25.400 --> 06:36:25.960
Member Burr.

06:36:26.840 --> 06:36:27.080
Aye.

06:36:27.640 --> 06:36:28.440
Member Bonacca.

06:36:29.560 --> 06:36:29.880
Aye.

06:36:30.520 --> 06:36:31.880
Motion passes unanimously.

06:36:32.920 --> 06:36:33.720
All right.

06:36:33.720 --> 06:36:35.400
Now you can all lower your hands.

06:36:35.400 --> 06:36:42.040
This is a performance task so we can all get ourselves back to where we were.

06:36:42.040 --> 06:36:42.520
All right.

06:36:42.520 --> 06:36:46.280
Thank you so much, Vice President Strauss, for all your work and that of the committee

06:36:46.280 --> 06:36:50.200
and getting us all these wonderful members of these committees.

06:36:50.200 --> 06:36:52.120
We appreciate them as well.

06:36:52.120 --> 06:36:53.720
They have a lot of work ahead of them.

06:36:53.720 --> 06:36:57.880
Some of them have already been involved and they know that and others will find it out.

06:36:57.880 --> 06:37:01.480
And they give us a lot of great and important advice.

06:37:01.480 --> 06:37:03.640
So we appreciate the process.

06:37:04.440 --> 06:37:08.040
I'm now going to go to our board member liaison reports.

06:37:09.000 --> 06:37:13.480
Any liaison activities that were not related to any items on our November agenda?

06:37:14.120 --> 06:37:17.800
And we'll go again in reverse alphabetical order.

06:37:18.600 --> 06:37:19.240
Member Sun.

06:37:20.280 --> 06:37:20.680
Okay.

06:37:20.680 --> 06:37:21.560
Thank you.

06:37:21.560 --> 06:37:27.320
So most of the work for the state board this month has been on the screening committee

06:37:27.320 --> 06:37:28.360
as we just went over.

06:37:29.320 --> 06:37:33.720
Also, you saw the assessment item and the federal ESSA item were also items

06:37:34.360 --> 06:37:36.120
that were covered in today's agenda.

06:37:36.920 --> 06:37:42.120
Just wanted to report that California Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory Committee

06:37:42.760 --> 06:37:45.960
met last month on the no, September 29.

06:37:46.760 --> 06:37:53.160
We are continuing our work on the state plan for CTE, the Career Technical Education,

06:37:53.720 --> 06:37:57.480
and CTE has engaged jobs for the future.

06:37:58.280 --> 06:38:00.600
An organization that will help us through that work.

06:38:00.600 --> 06:38:06.120
Oh, and our next meeting is on the 19th of December.

06:38:09.320 --> 06:38:09.800
That's it.

06:38:10.600 --> 06:38:11.000
All right.

06:38:12.360 --> 06:38:13.400
Vice President Strauss.

06:38:14.280 --> 06:38:17.640
So I do have a few things to share in addition to screening.

06:38:17.640 --> 06:38:25.720
So when the IQC met in September 22nd, 23rd, we had our new IQC student commissioner,

06:38:25.720 --> 06:38:26.680
Juliana Garcia.

06:38:26.680 --> 06:38:32.760
She's a senior at John F. Kennedy Middle College High School in Corona Norco Unified School

06:38:32.760 --> 06:38:33.160
District.

06:38:33.160 --> 06:38:38.280
And she's talked, we had her introduce herself and she talked about seeking changes in

06:38:38.280 --> 06:38:44.680
instruction and curriculum for her peers, advocating for curriculum that deals with,

06:38:45.800 --> 06:38:50.440
that addresses non-diverse issues and wants to have changes.

06:38:50.440 --> 06:38:55.480
And she's been involved in nationwide youth organization to communicate.

06:38:55.480 --> 06:38:56.280
And to advocate.

06:38:56.280 --> 06:38:58.200
So I think we're very, very fortunate.

06:38:58.200 --> 06:39:00.680
As she said, she wants to diversify our narrative.

06:39:00.680 --> 06:39:05.640
So she will be an important student voice on our IQC as well.

06:39:05.640 --> 06:39:12.680
There was a wonderful presentation at that meeting on specialized media and technology

06:39:12.680 --> 06:39:14.600
for Braille, audiobooks.

06:39:14.600 --> 06:39:19.480
I don't think all of us realize the whole department at CTE that deals with that.

06:39:19.480 --> 06:39:24.680
So if you're interested, you can go back to the IQC recording of the meeting.

06:39:24.680 --> 06:39:26.120
But I just wanted to highlight that.

06:39:26.920 --> 06:39:32.920
And then as I said, the IQC, we're going to be screening in December for two more IQC

06:39:32.920 --> 06:39:36.680
members and one member of the advisory commission on special ed.

06:39:36.680 --> 06:39:39.880
So please look for that if that's relevant of your interest.

06:39:40.840 --> 06:39:45.480
Both member Rucker and I attended the NASB, the National Association of State School

06:39:45.480 --> 06:39:46.920
Boards of Education.

06:39:46.920 --> 06:39:48.200
And a couple highlights.

06:39:48.920 --> 06:39:52.920
They really want to, they recognize obviously this is a really pivotal time in public

06:39:52.920 --> 06:39:59.320
education and that state boards can address policy during this time and looking at the

06:39:59.320 --> 06:40:01.880
state board role in leveraging policy.

06:40:01.880 --> 06:40:05.400
So just so you know, if you're interested, it's free.

06:40:05.400 --> 06:40:09.320
You can go on the website for the NASB 2021 conference.

06:40:09.320 --> 06:40:16.360
And some plenary sessions were recorded that talked about leading in the time of

06:40:16.360 --> 06:40:20.920
uncertainty, digital access for students with disabilities, policy levers for teacher

06:40:20.920 --> 06:40:25.400
education programs, renewing the promise of equity and excellence, supporting school

06:40:25.400 --> 06:40:27.960
leaders through the pandemic recovery and beyond.

06:40:27.960 --> 06:40:28.840
And that's important.

06:40:28.840 --> 06:40:32.440
I know they are exhausted as well as teachers as well.

06:40:32.440 --> 06:40:35.320
And then the final one, finding joy in public service.

06:40:35.320 --> 06:40:39.480
So I thought, you know, you might want to just kind of look at a recording on that.

06:40:40.040 --> 06:40:43.960
I also represent California for the Western region and the delegate assembly.

06:40:43.960 --> 06:40:48.760
And then the special ed advisory commission did meet on the 27th of October.

06:40:48.760 --> 06:40:52.440
And that's also taped if you're interested.

06:40:52.440 --> 06:40:57.720
But the IEP program template and alternative pathways to diploma.

06:40:57.720 --> 06:40:59.320
There was an update on that.

06:40:59.320 --> 06:41:03.800
It's funded in a 2021 California state budget act to take a look at that.

06:41:04.360 --> 06:41:05.080
Really important.

06:41:05.080 --> 06:41:08.840
It's being handled by Sacramento County office and West Ed.

06:41:08.840 --> 06:41:10.920
Very interesting presentation.

06:41:10.920 --> 06:41:14.280
And then special ed funding system study update.

06:41:14.280 --> 06:41:16.760
That's a process that's also going on that I think.

06:41:17.400 --> 06:41:19.240
I wanted to share a couple key findings.

06:41:19.240 --> 06:41:21.960
Those of us who look at funding issues with special ed.

06:41:21.960 --> 06:41:25.480
No, here are some key findings that won't surprise you.

06:41:25.480 --> 06:41:29.320
But the cost of achievement increases as students have multiple needs.

06:41:29.320 --> 06:41:33.480
That English learners represent a larger proportion of students with disabilities

06:41:33.480 --> 06:41:35.080
later in K-12 education.

06:41:35.720 --> 06:41:41.080
That our statewide cost high cost pools to support LEAs with high cost special

06:41:41.080 --> 06:41:45.160
education programs are among the lowest funded pools in the nation.

06:41:45.720 --> 06:41:50.680
And that the nonpublic school placement patterns that the current funding formula

06:41:50.680 --> 06:41:54.040
actually incentivize placement in nonpublic schools.

06:41:54.040 --> 06:41:55.960
Which I thought was really interesting.

06:41:55.960 --> 06:41:59.880
And that white students were more likely to be placed in nonpublic school settings.

06:42:01.800 --> 06:42:08.040
And that students with emotional disturbance, autism, specific learning disability,

06:42:08.040 --> 06:42:10.280
other health impairment are the ones more likely.

06:42:10.280 --> 06:42:12.840
So I thought that would be interesting to share.

06:42:12.840 --> 06:42:16.120
They did talk a lot about promoting inclusive practices.

06:42:16.120 --> 06:42:18.360
Appropriate early intervention and identification.

06:42:18.360 --> 06:42:23.320
And making sure that the funds get to the students who have the greatest need.

06:42:23.320 --> 06:42:27.880
Also there was a discussion about the family empowerment center expansion.

06:42:27.880 --> 06:42:29.720
Was part of a budget program as well.

06:42:30.520 --> 06:42:31.560
Enhancement program.

06:42:32.200 --> 06:42:37.960
And there was like $5 million to increase the family empowerment center.

06:42:37.960 --> 06:42:39.240
So that was important.

06:42:39.240 --> 06:42:41.160
And that's a budget enhancement.

06:42:41.800 --> 06:42:48.360
I just wanted to talk quickly about the CSU has a committee called closing.

06:42:49.560 --> 06:42:51.480
The center to close the opportunity gap.

06:42:51.480 --> 06:42:55.880
And their work, which was also funded by a budget trailer item.

06:42:55.880 --> 06:42:58.680
Also links very much with the work we're doing.

06:42:58.680 --> 06:43:00.680
And I think Francisco actually knows some about it.

06:43:00.680 --> 06:43:04.040
Because there's a partnership with Chula Vista Elementary is one of their partners.

06:43:04.040 --> 06:43:05.160
They talked about.

06:43:05.160 --> 06:43:08.520
But they're talking about looking at professional preparation of educators.

06:43:08.520 --> 06:43:13.000
Talking a lot about schools that serve high concentrations of black Latinx.

06:43:13.000 --> 06:43:15.720
And socioeconomically disadvantaged students.

06:43:15.720 --> 06:43:23.640
Looking at models that blends practitioners and interest holders from across the state.

06:43:23.640 --> 06:43:25.640
And they've done a lot of review.

06:43:25.640 --> 06:43:27.240
They're starting a website.

06:43:27.240 --> 06:43:29.000
They're curating some materials.

06:43:29.000 --> 06:43:31.000
They've had an education summit.

06:43:31.000 --> 06:43:32.920
And they're going to be disseminating materials.

06:43:32.920 --> 06:43:34.440
I think it might be really relevant.

06:43:34.440 --> 06:43:38.920
I know certainly with Superintendent Thurman's task force as well.

06:43:38.920 --> 06:43:40.040
The equity issues.

06:43:40.040 --> 06:43:42.600
They're looking at resources.

06:43:42.600 --> 06:43:44.680
And then how do we build capacity?

06:43:44.680 --> 06:43:46.280
Which all of us are talking about.

06:43:46.280 --> 06:43:49.800
For both pre-service teachers and teachers in the field.

06:43:49.800 --> 06:43:53.480
And so I just think this opportunity for regional hubs.

06:43:53.480 --> 06:43:57.320
They have one at San Diego State and at Cal State Fullerton.

06:43:58.040 --> 06:44:03.400
Will be really helpful in sharing practices to close the opportunity gap.

06:44:03.400 --> 06:44:05.080
So I just wanted to share that as well.

06:44:05.080 --> 06:44:06.760
So that ends my report.

06:44:06.760 --> 06:44:07.640
Thank you very much.

06:44:08.840 --> 06:44:09.340
Thank you.

06:44:10.040 --> 06:44:10.760
Member Rucker.

06:44:11.480 --> 06:44:16.840
So I'll begin my report by saying I got a text message from Board Member Ting Tsang

06:44:16.840 --> 06:44:19.160
asking me to make a correction.

06:44:19.880 --> 06:44:23.480
So November 19th is an important day in history.

06:44:23.480 --> 06:44:25.960
That was the day the Beatles released their album.

06:44:25.960 --> 06:44:31.880
The Magical Mystery Tour was also the day Abraham Lincoln delivered his Gettysburg address.

06:44:31.960 --> 06:44:36.920
It's my birthday, but that's also the day the California Workforce Pathways Joint

06:44:36.920 --> 06:44:39.480
Advisory Committee will be meeting.

06:44:39.480 --> 06:44:43.240
Not on December 19th, but on November 19th.

06:44:43.240 --> 06:44:45.320
So I wanted to make sure I did that.

06:44:46.760 --> 06:44:50.920
Board Member Strauss talked a lot about the work that's going on with the ITC.

06:44:50.920 --> 06:44:52.360
So I don't need to comment on that.

06:44:52.360 --> 06:44:57.000
But I do want to draw attention to something that I think is a pretty big deal for the

06:44:57.000 --> 06:45:00.040
Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory Committee.

06:45:00.120 --> 06:45:07.000
We have been spending quite some time as a group having meetings to take a look at data

06:45:07.000 --> 06:45:09.400
and doing a really in-depth data study.

06:45:09.400 --> 06:45:14.840
As a matter of fact, a joint study session with our community partner groups to look

06:45:14.840 --> 06:45:20.360
at the development of the new California State Plan for Career Technical Education.

06:45:20.360 --> 06:45:25.080
So I really do want to take a moment just to congratulate the work that's being developed

06:45:25.080 --> 06:45:28.520
by department staff in preparation for this meeting.

06:45:28.520 --> 06:45:34.920
They have pulled together a lot of data, not only from our state's data system for accountability,

06:45:34.920 --> 06:45:41.320
but they have framed and recalibrated some of the data points that we have required as

06:45:41.320 --> 06:45:48.200
part of the work for the applications for the two funding streams that we are primarily

06:45:48.200 --> 06:45:51.080
responsible for overseeing and monitoring.

06:45:51.080 --> 06:45:55.080
At this next upcoming meeting, we're actually going to see a data report that's looking

06:45:55.080 --> 06:45:58.680
at state accountability assessment data at the claims level.

06:45:58.680 --> 06:46:05.320
What I'm really looking forward to in that conversation is it's the data that's reported

06:46:05.320 --> 06:46:11.480
at the claims level that's most directly related to what we hold these programs accountable

06:46:11.480 --> 06:46:15.400
for in the performance of students who come through their programs.

06:46:15.400 --> 06:46:19.960
So we'll have an opportunity to really look at what is the instructional impact of these

06:46:19.960 --> 06:46:24.440
programs on moving students toward proficiency on those standards.

06:46:24.440 --> 06:46:29.480
So it promises to be a very promising meeting, not only the joint study session with our

06:46:29.480 --> 06:46:34.440
community partners, but the work that's going to take a look at how to frame that discussion

06:46:34.440 --> 06:46:35.240
on accountability.

06:46:35.240 --> 06:46:37.240
So I think that's going to be a very exciting meeting.

06:46:38.760 --> 06:46:40.120
And that ends my report.

06:46:40.120 --> 06:46:42.360
Thank you, Ting, for giving me the chance to say that.

06:46:44.360 --> 06:46:45.880
Happy birthday in advance.

06:46:48.920 --> 06:46:50.760
Member Rodriguez.

06:46:51.400 --> 06:46:52.280
Yes, thank you.

06:46:53.240 --> 06:47:00.120
So the California Summer School for the Arts, we had a board meeting on October 21st.

06:47:00.760 --> 06:47:04.600
And I want to share a few of the highlights.

06:47:07.240 --> 06:47:09.880
The new executive, well, he's not that new anymore.

06:47:09.880 --> 06:47:17.720
Matthew Gallagher has come in with a lot of enthusiasm and has demonstrated his enthusiasm

06:47:17.720 --> 06:47:19.000
with a lot of work.

06:47:19.000 --> 06:47:26.040
He completed a six-year dashboard so that there's data to show our student demographics,

06:47:26.040 --> 06:47:33.160
who's participating, the race ethnicity demographics, financial aid, student enrollment.

06:47:33.160 --> 06:47:39.800
And so he has put together a report, which I am happy to share in an email with Brooks.

06:47:39.800 --> 06:47:41.640
And so he can pass on to all of you.

06:47:42.360 --> 06:47:51.880
And also prompted from some of those conversations is the strengthening development of a DEI

06:47:51.880 --> 06:47:56.120
committee, which was established in spring of 2021.

06:47:56.120 --> 06:48:03.960
I alluded to it a little bit in my last update, but the committee has been very active.

06:48:03.960 --> 06:48:11.080
They're really looking at not only geographic, socioeconomic, racial and ethnic

06:48:11.160 --> 06:48:13.080
representation from throughout the state.

06:48:13.640 --> 06:48:17.960
Because as you'll see in the dashboard, a lot of the representation, it's really heavy

06:48:17.960 --> 06:48:19.320
in the Los Angeles area.

06:48:20.040 --> 06:48:23.320
And one of the things that I mentioned to Matthew when I went through the board,

06:48:27.320 --> 06:48:28.040
what do you call that?

06:48:28.040 --> 06:48:31.720
The like when you're introduced, I'm completely blank.

06:48:32.760 --> 06:48:37.160
Yes, when I was talking to him and I said, you know, I was the visual and performing

06:48:37.160 --> 06:48:42.920
arts coordinator at my former school and I had never heard of the California Summer

06:48:42.920 --> 06:48:44.280
School for the Arts.

06:48:44.280 --> 06:48:48.040
And we have a lot of very talented students down here.

06:48:48.840 --> 06:48:54.280
And so anyway, he and I will be meeting next week to talk about ideas on how to reach

06:48:55.000 --> 06:49:01.640
more rural, more, you know, areas that are a little further removed from the cities

06:49:02.200 --> 06:49:05.480
and to be able to recruit students from communities like ours as well.

06:49:07.320 --> 06:49:10.040
They're also looking for a location.

06:49:11.880 --> 06:49:18.840
The CalArts responded to the request for proposal, but they're looking at the whole

06:49:18.840 --> 06:49:22.440
money situation and that's in the works right now.

06:49:22.440 --> 06:49:30.520
So and I believe that the summer school has met at CalArts all of the time in the past.

06:49:30.520 --> 06:49:37.320
And so I think it's a bit of an economic and visiting various other sites.

06:49:37.960 --> 06:49:46.200
So that is my and there's also a student survey, sorry, that was conducted by Professor Emeritus

06:49:46.200 --> 06:49:54.440
of UC Santa Cruz, David Harrington, and he surveyed students over the past several years.

06:49:55.080 --> 06:50:05.000
And 97% of the students believe that the summer school helped them a lot with their educational

06:50:05.000 --> 06:50:05.800
and career goals.

06:50:07.000 --> 06:50:12.360
We all know how important the arts are for development, for humanity, right?

06:50:12.360 --> 06:50:16.680
You know, building those neural pathways and also careers.

06:50:16.680 --> 06:50:21.640
We're in California where there are a lot of opportunities for whether it's visual and

06:50:21.640 --> 06:50:28.760
performing arts or animation, and a lot of these students actually go into careers like that.

06:50:28.760 --> 06:50:33.000
You know, and there's one of the responses to the young lady who spoke this morning

06:50:33.960 --> 06:50:37.640
who was talking about the preparation once students graduate, right?

06:50:37.640 --> 06:50:41.400
We can, there are definitely a lot of opportunities here with

06:50:42.120 --> 06:50:44.280
the summer school for the arts for our students.

06:50:45.480 --> 06:50:50.760
And I will move on, I'm trying to rush through this, to the CTC meeting.

06:50:51.400 --> 06:50:57.720
We only met for one day and moved the October meeting into September.

06:50:58.920 --> 06:51:05.800
So an announcement, teacher residency capacity grant request for applications is now open.

06:51:07.880 --> 06:51:15.800
The governor signed the budget in July 2021 and it includes $350 million in funding

06:51:15.800 --> 06:51:20.200
for competitive grants to support a collaborative partnership between

06:51:20.200 --> 06:51:26.600
an eligible ally or a consortium with one or more commission approved

06:51:26.600 --> 06:51:31.800
teacher preparation programs offered by a regionally accredited institution.

06:51:31.800 --> 06:51:34.680
For more information, visit the CTC's website.

06:51:35.240 --> 06:51:41.400
The RFA is due to the commission by 5 p.m. on February 14th.

06:51:42.360 --> 06:51:45.240
And there are some wonderful residency models

06:51:45.800 --> 06:51:52.840
that, you know, happening at the state where teachers are really benefiting from the experiences.

06:51:55.160 --> 06:52:01.240
And also there's a, the local solutions to the shortage of special education teachers,

06:52:01.240 --> 06:52:07.880
local solutions as it's called grants, were included in the 2018-19 state budget.

06:52:08.600 --> 06:52:15.320
And the commission reviewed the report as of now how things are going.

06:52:15.400 --> 06:52:18.200
There were some narrative comments in the annual reports.

06:52:19.800 --> 06:52:24.040
Some of the participants were a little disappointed about not being able to complete

06:52:25.560 --> 06:52:28.920
what they set out to do because of the distance learning,

06:52:28.920 --> 06:52:33.080
right, you know, so that that interrupted their plans a little bit, but they will continue.

06:52:35.400 --> 06:52:40.440
In the narrative comments included in the annual report and emails received,

06:52:40.520 --> 06:52:46.600
the grantees expressed overwhelming enthusiasm and gratitude for the local solutions grant program

06:52:46.600 --> 06:52:49.240
and the opportunities that the funds have provided them.

06:52:50.280 --> 06:52:54.840
Many programs have identified promising practices such as signing bonuses,

06:52:55.400 --> 06:52:59.640
tuition reimbursement payment, and strong mentoring programs

06:52:59.640 --> 06:53:04.200
that are already improving special education in the grantee alley A.

06:53:04.840 --> 06:53:06.280
So I wanted to highlight that.

06:53:06.280 --> 06:53:13.560
And also the commission has been working, so this is a member Patil Bronson,

06:53:13.560 --> 06:53:16.840
towards transformative work in early childhood education.

06:53:16.840 --> 06:53:22.600
Over the past several years, to set the foundation and the context for the work proposed,

06:53:24.200 --> 06:53:31.400
there are an array of credentials and assignments that could be adjusted and repurposed

06:53:31.400 --> 06:53:34.120
to meet the changing workforce needs.

06:53:34.120 --> 06:53:38.760
And so this was only an information item, but, you know, there was a lot of talk about the

06:53:38.760 --> 06:53:46.520
possibilities on how to either laterally move or best prepare teachers or use already existing

06:53:46.520 --> 06:53:54.440
credentials to support the opportunities for preparation of the EC workforce.

06:53:55.400 --> 06:53:59.960
And that is that is all.

06:54:00.920 --> 06:54:01.800
Those are the highlights.

06:54:01.800 --> 06:54:02.280
Thank you.

06:54:03.000 --> 06:54:03.560
Thank you.

06:54:03.560 --> 06:54:04.840
Member Patil Bronson.

06:54:06.920 --> 06:54:15.240
I'm going to pick up on the last committee report around CTC and talk a little bit about

06:54:15.240 --> 06:54:21.960
a emerging or actually now well underway effort which CDE has undertaken.

06:54:22.520 --> 06:54:26.120
And really also just start by commending the leadership of Sarah Neville-Morgan,

06:54:27.080 --> 06:54:33.960
who has been convening a series of working groups between CDE, CTC, and a

06:54:33.960 --> 06:54:40.760
variety of other stakeholders across educational partners, excuse me, across

06:54:41.720 --> 06:54:49.000
state agencies, community organizations, and different representatives from both

06:54:49.000 --> 06:54:53.080
LEAs as well as community-based organizations in the early learning space.

06:54:53.640 --> 06:55:00.120
All of this is focused on what is the implementation effort necessary in order to

06:55:00.120 --> 06:55:06.200
properly launch the UPK universal preschool and universal transitional kindergarten

06:55:08.760 --> 06:55:17.880
investments that were approved, which were exciting and are going to be birthed and need

06:55:17.880 --> 06:55:22.920
the full implementation resources to be successful as they're brought in into

06:55:24.920 --> 06:55:31.000
This means in part thinking about local implementation practices, leverage

06:55:32.120 --> 06:55:37.960
research that we know of best practices from other states, and what actually drives fair

06:55:37.960 --> 06:55:46.680
and just child outcomes across socioeconomic and also that provides for integrated learning

06:55:46.680 --> 06:55:52.840
environments. And then to the last point that board member Rodriguez was just describing around

06:55:52.840 --> 06:55:59.960
workforce, thinking about how do we leverage the incredible asset that we have in that the early

06:55:59.960 --> 06:56:05.400
learning teacher community has tended to be more socioeconomically and racially diverse,

06:56:06.360 --> 06:56:16.680
and how do we help folks come into the TK space who have BAs who are in line or alluded to

06:56:17.560 --> 06:56:23.960
the multiple subject credential already have the 24 units of ECE specific education.

06:56:25.560 --> 06:56:32.040
Similarly, how do we actually make sure that state preschool programs are also well launched

06:56:32.040 --> 06:56:38.600
and have the workforce that they need in order to continue that pipeline of education so that

06:56:40.280 --> 06:56:48.040
in the best forecast of what we would want as kids enter the TK to 12 system in California,

06:56:48.040 --> 06:56:55.080
they'll have had the benefit for low income kids of a widely expanded state preschool program,

06:56:55.080 --> 06:56:59.240
as well as a universal transitional kindergarten program for fours.

06:57:00.040 --> 06:57:04.280
There's also been a lot of discussion about sort of what are the communication

06:57:05.480 --> 06:57:12.040
vehicles that are necessary in order to share broadly. And I think this is really just an

06:57:12.040 --> 06:57:19.640
exciting space for being able to bring to bear the best learnings that we've seen from so many

06:57:19.640 --> 06:57:24.840
other states that have gone down this also figure out what is the California way in the space

06:57:25.560 --> 06:57:30.680
to make it successful. Lastly, I'll just mention that later this month we'll also be

06:57:36.280 --> 06:57:39.960
the early childhood policy council meeting in two weeks, and that will be

06:57:40.520 --> 06:57:44.760
likely focused a little bit more on zero to three and thinking about how do we ensure that learning

06:57:45.480 --> 06:57:48.520
knowing that learning begins at birth, how do we leverage the possibilities

06:57:49.480 --> 06:57:52.680
to actually ensure that that pipeline of learning continues

06:57:53.640 --> 06:57:58.200
in the full zero to five space and then is continued in the P to three aligned space.

06:57:59.400 --> 06:58:04.200
And that concludes my report. Terrific. Thank you. Member McQuillin.

06:58:06.520 --> 06:58:11.800
Not as much as others to report on. I'll be thankful at this hour of the day, but

06:58:11.800 --> 06:58:19.240
as we heard this morning, the students that reported out on the from the

06:58:20.280 --> 06:58:25.560
Sabe, the student advisory board on education, I had the pleasure of working with them and preparing

06:58:25.560 --> 06:58:30.840
them for those presentations. It was fantastic. It was just a pleasure to work directly with the

06:58:30.840 --> 06:58:38.440
students. And my goal is to see some representation from above San Francisco from districts up here

06:58:39.240 --> 06:58:45.160
at that student conference and maybe applying next year to be our student representative. But

06:58:45.160 --> 06:58:51.720
there were definitely some Bay Area reps that made the application process. That was a real pleasure.

06:58:53.880 --> 06:58:56.920
We also heard this morning in the superintendent's report that

06:58:58.040 --> 06:59:04.520
Assemblyman Ramos has been very busy and he's sponsoring some new legislation on American

06:59:04.520 --> 06:59:10.600
Indian education in California. It's really exciting. It's early in the process and he

06:59:10.600 --> 06:59:19.800
took a lot of input on that. And also the governor signed a task force that's rather unique

06:59:21.000 --> 06:59:30.200
that is going to look at protecting items worn at graduation by American Indians and making

06:59:30.200 --> 06:59:35.560
recommendations of what those items are if a student wanted to wear a feather or something

06:59:35.560 --> 06:59:43.960
representing their tribal tribe in California that they can do so during graduation. There's a task

06:59:43.960 --> 06:59:52.680
force that'll be set up to do that. Looking forward to having some input on that. And then

06:59:53.640 --> 06:59:56.680
I'm also looking forward to the big day on November 19th

06:59:57.240 --> 07:00:04.760
for the joint task force on CTE coming back together. And a birthday I guess too.

07:00:06.920 --> 07:00:12.920
So thank you, that's all. Thank you so much and thanks for all the support you gave the students.

07:00:14.200 --> 07:00:21.160
That was wonderful and I'm sure all that coaching really made them more confident and ready to do

07:00:21.240 --> 07:00:26.120
this presentation. So that was terrific. Member Glover Woods.

07:00:27.720 --> 07:00:33.880
I don't have anything additional to report. Both items I would have shared were on today's agenda,

07:00:33.880 --> 07:00:38.680
world languages and the work of the screening committee. So nothing else to report at this time.

07:00:39.720 --> 07:00:46.200
Well job well done because we got both of those over the finish line. So thank you. Member Escobedo.

07:00:46.200 --> 07:00:56.120
Yes, I've been part of the WestEd group for the last year or so. It's been an impressive group.

07:00:56.120 --> 07:01:03.240
They've facilitated an intersegmental working group that developed a comprehensive technical

07:01:03.240 --> 07:01:10.280
and legal framework for the new cradle to career public data system to provide information on

07:01:10.360 --> 07:01:17.400
students as they progress from early education to college and into California's labor market.

07:01:17.400 --> 07:01:25.320
Now this system will allow for linking data on academic success, persistence, school quality

07:01:25.960 --> 07:01:32.600
and socioeconomic indicators and will enable state regions and state educational systems

07:01:33.240 --> 07:01:39.080
to better understand how educational programs contribute to student learning and

07:01:40.280 --> 07:01:48.120
workforce preparedness. This new cradle to career data system was funded by the California

07:01:48.120 --> 07:01:57.640
legislature. I believe it was in the summer of 2021 the system is being built. It's underway

07:01:57.640 --> 07:02:06.600
and really looking forward to seeing it in place. We had our first in-person board meeting for over

07:02:07.480 --> 07:02:12.040
almost two years. It was great to see everyone. Actually I'm looking forward to seeing everyone

07:02:12.760 --> 07:02:22.120
this board as well. We had our meeting about a week ago in Phoenix and we were hosted by the Helios

07:02:23.000 --> 07:02:32.040
Education Foundation which is one of the largest educational foundations in Arizona.

07:02:32.680 --> 07:02:42.200
They support some of WestEd's work. For example, Helios recently published a brief on college access

07:02:42.200 --> 07:02:50.040
and attainment strategies and programs for men of color. One of the features that really struck me

07:02:50.040 --> 07:02:58.840
was the decision theater in this building and this I felt like I was like in an Epcot venue.

07:02:58.840 --> 07:03:07.080
I mean I was surrounded by screens and it was probably the most interactive data visualization

07:03:08.920 --> 07:03:15.560
experience I've ever seen. So we had two superintendents that was able to highlight

07:03:16.200 --> 07:03:22.040
their districts in one screen and then another screen we're able to see the amount of violence

07:03:22.040 --> 07:03:29.400
students are exposed to, lead content, air quality. Another screen you got to see some of the

07:03:29.400 --> 07:03:39.400
socioeconomic indicators and another screen you might have been able to see the work and industrial

07:03:39.800 --> 07:03:49.560
profile of that area. The beauty of this experience was that the superintendents

07:03:49.560 --> 07:03:55.640
were able to manipulate some of the data by saying what would happen if I increased my

07:03:55.640 --> 07:04:02.280
graduation rate by 10% and how would that affect crime and how that would affect

07:04:02.840 --> 07:04:12.840
taxes. For example, the amount of taxes a city is able to gain. It was remarkable. I've never seen

07:04:14.200 --> 07:04:21.320
how data could create a story so visually. A great experience, a lot to learn

07:04:22.280 --> 07:04:29.000
and I think it's very powerful not only for districts but also for mayors and decision

07:04:29.000 --> 07:04:35.880
makers to really see that education is an investment. It is not an expense. It isn't

07:04:35.880 --> 07:04:43.480
an investment because it affects every facet of our society. So that was a great experience,

07:04:43.480 --> 07:04:50.200
the decision theater and that is my report and I will report again tomorrow

07:04:51.080 --> 07:04:56.360
with the community school agenda item which will be number one.

07:04:57.800 --> 07:05:05.720
You know, that sounds like something that would be such a huge benefit for civic engagement and

07:05:05.720 --> 07:05:12.360
policymaking generally. So thank you for describing that. I'm going to find out more. Member Burr.

07:05:12.680 --> 07:05:18.120
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond. I was also thinking as Member Escobedo was reporting

07:05:18.120 --> 07:05:23.720
that it could be perfect for the next LCAP iteration. There you go.

07:05:24.920 --> 07:05:29.640
Per board member Sun's recommendations this morning that we do something that is engaging

07:05:30.360 --> 07:05:34.520
and is meaningful to the participants so we would love to learn more about that.

07:05:35.480 --> 07:05:39.560
My report on accountability took place this morning about the LCAP template.

07:05:39.960 --> 07:05:43.480
I'm just going to talk briefly about the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence

07:05:44.360 --> 07:05:51.160
board met last week. We also met in person. It's quite the opportunity. People are elated to see

07:05:51.160 --> 07:05:56.040
each other in person. We were able to meet at the Sacramento City Unified School District and we

07:05:56.040 --> 07:06:03.400
thank Superintendent Aguilar for that opportunity. So just a few highlights. As you all know,

07:06:04.200 --> 07:06:15.800
a former colleague, many of our former colleagues, Matt Nava was appointed as Executive Director of

07:06:15.800 --> 07:06:21.240
the Collaborative and he not surprisingly hit the ground running. As he told us in the interview,

07:06:21.240 --> 07:06:27.960
he was going to do a 90-day plan. He's been actively engaged in engagement and strategic

07:06:27.960 --> 07:06:33.880
planning effort. I think he's interviewed more than 140 of our educational partners

07:06:34.600 --> 07:06:40.040
to identify the sort of classic strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to the

07:06:40.040 --> 07:06:45.880
CCE. It's sort of a perfect time to reflect back. We've been in existence six or seven years.

07:06:45.880 --> 07:06:52.360
And as he said, we're now in our teenage phase. I hope not the unruly teenagers, but we are

07:06:52.360 --> 07:06:56.120
certainly in a place where we have a pretty good idea about what we should be doing. We've been

07:06:56.120 --> 07:07:02.040
given lots of tasks by the legislature and the governor, but we need to step back and say,

07:07:02.040 --> 07:07:09.720
are we really being responsive to the folks who were supposed to be assisting? So from that work,

07:07:09.720 --> 07:07:16.120
he's going to be developing a mission, vision, and values statement. We have the mission statement

07:07:16.120 --> 07:07:21.480
already, but doing some refinement there. There's a two-page presentation that's on our website if

07:07:21.480 --> 07:07:27.800
you're interested in looking in more detail. We also had a very robust presentation by the

07:07:27.800 --> 07:07:34.280
professional learning team at CCE. They're also doing, they're part of the strategic engagement

07:07:34.280 --> 07:07:41.080
and strategic planning, and they're developing their objectives going forward, especially around

07:07:41.080 --> 07:07:46.600
professional learning that's based on evidence and best practice, that is a rapid response to

07:07:46.680 --> 07:07:52.120
support teaching and learning, and to be sure that they increase accessibility too, and the use of

07:07:52.120 --> 07:07:56.840
all of the resources. We had a really nice presentation from the Los Angeles County Office

07:07:56.840 --> 07:08:04.600
of Education on how they have actually been using one of the sort of centerpieces of work that was

07:08:04.600 --> 07:08:09.960
created in response to the pandemic, the Field Guide for Accelerating Learning. So it was great

07:08:09.960 --> 07:08:15.960
to hear how the folks on the ground are actually using this just vast wealth of materials that

07:08:15.960 --> 07:08:24.520
CCE created in response to needs of the pandemic. Going forward with respect to the professional

07:08:24.520 --> 07:08:29.080
learning unit, they're really going to be focusing on universal design for learning

07:08:29.080 --> 07:08:36.360
and making sure that all of our LEAs have access to those approaches and are able to implement the

07:08:36.360 --> 07:08:41.320
universal design for learning. We had a big presentation on the budget and the trailer bill,

07:08:41.320 --> 07:08:48.280
lots of responsibilities for CCE, but the one I'll highlight is the $50 million grant program

07:08:48.840 --> 07:08:54.520
that is provided for professional learning to support, again, learning acceleration in the

07:08:54.520 --> 07:09:00.840
main areas of math, literacy, and language development, and the CCE staff are busy

07:09:00.840 --> 07:09:07.400
working on the RFP for that. Those grants go out to LEAs, so I'll keep you updated on that.

07:09:07.480 --> 07:09:12.760
And then finally, we just spend some time acknowledging our former executive director,

07:09:12.760 --> 07:09:18.840
Tom Armolino, and again, want to congratulate Tom on his retirement. Our next meeting will be

07:09:18.840 --> 07:09:23.800
December 2nd, and that will be a virtual meeting. That completes my report.

07:09:25.240 --> 07:09:29.640
Perfect. And member Banaka.

07:09:29.640 --> 07:09:37.000
Thank you. Recently, I've been attending and speaking at quite a few student advocacy

07:09:37.000 --> 07:09:42.760
conferences. So in late September, I was a speaker at the San Benito CAS conference with

07:09:42.760 --> 07:09:49.640
their superintendent's student advisory council, where I talked about ways that students can engage

07:09:49.640 --> 07:09:55.800
in statewide advocacy and heard some of their ideas for changes in education. I was also a

07:09:55.800 --> 07:10:01.640
panelist at the Stockton student advisory conference and the CASC region 10 conference,

07:10:01.640 --> 07:10:06.200
where I heard student proposals on issues relating to education and gave feedback.

07:10:07.240 --> 07:10:12.760
I really enjoyed being at these conferences and hearing so many different student perspectives

07:10:13.480 --> 07:10:19.400
on issues ranging from mental health to equity to curriculum, because it really helps inform my

07:10:19.400 --> 07:10:25.000
perspective and helps me understand what students in the state are feeling and what they're thinking

07:10:25.000 --> 07:10:30.760
about our education system. And then last but definitely not least, over this past weekend,

07:10:30.760 --> 07:10:36.760
I attended the student advisory board on education and helped facilitate the selection process for

07:10:37.480 --> 07:10:42.360
the upcoming student board member. And I know we already went over this, but I just wanted

07:10:42.360 --> 07:10:47.800
to reiterate how talented and accomplished every single one of these semifinalists

07:10:47.800 --> 07:10:52.600
are. And I think that we're really lucky to have these students be in the running

07:10:52.600 --> 07:10:57.000
for our next student board member. And that'll be all for my liaison report.

07:10:58.280 --> 07:11:03.720
Terrific. Thank you. And I'll just add a couple of things. I mean, a lot of ground has been covered,

07:11:03.720 --> 07:11:09.880
but part of what's going on now, of course, is that we had this amazing budget last year with

07:11:09.880 --> 07:11:15.720
so much investment in education. And we've heard about TK and about investments in the teaching

07:11:15.720 --> 07:11:21.720
force and special education and the community schools we'll hear about tomorrow. So there's been

07:11:21.720 --> 07:11:26.760
a lot going on to sort of figure out how to implement all of this work in a way that will

07:11:26.760 --> 07:11:32.520
actually be effective, that will get to the people who need it in ways that they can use it.

07:11:33.240 --> 07:11:40.280
And I think that's going to continue to be a part of our challenge over the next several years. Much

07:11:40.280 --> 07:11:47.560
of this funding is expected to play out over the next five years. And so there's a lot to figure

07:11:47.560 --> 07:11:53.400
out in terms of how people can take it up, integrate it. I think the board has been very

07:11:53.400 --> 07:12:00.200
mindful about all the ways in which we can be sensitive to the overwhelming experience that it

07:12:00.200 --> 07:12:06.440
is to be in a school district right now as a leader, as a teacher, and so on. And then, well,

07:12:07.080 --> 07:12:14.120
these changes are important, adding another grade, adding TK. And with the infrastructure bill that's

07:12:14.120 --> 07:12:20.120
about to pass in Washington, there'll be significant resources for three- and four-year-old

07:12:20.120 --> 07:12:25.080
universal pre-Ks. So if we just want to think even a little bit more aspirationally,

07:12:25.080 --> 07:12:30.920
redesigning schools to be community schools so that they can integrate these services. So

07:12:31.480 --> 07:12:37.560
I'll just say that that's going to be an ongoing thread of work for us. I would just add a couple

07:12:37.560 --> 07:12:44.280
of points to what's already been mentioned. On the investments in the teaching force,

07:12:45.160 --> 07:12:51.800
I day talked about the funding for teacher residency programs, which a number of districts

07:12:51.800 --> 07:12:58.680
have found has really helped them in the pandemic to have programs of teacher education that are

07:12:58.680 --> 07:13:05.000
bringing people in, training them for a year, bringing them ready to start at the district

07:13:05.400 --> 07:13:10.760
as well prepared as a teacher with a couple of years of experience because they've been

07:13:10.760 --> 07:13:15.640
rooted in a very integrated approach to their training from excellent mentor teachers. That's

07:13:15.640 --> 07:13:21.160
supplemented also by Golden State Scholarships, which have a significant amount of money will

07:13:21.160 --> 07:13:28.200
support people coming into teaching for up to $20,000 in scholarship support if they teach in

07:13:28.200 --> 07:13:33.240
the fields and places where they're most needed. And all of these things are kind of getting off

07:13:33.240 --> 07:13:38.520
the ground. We want people to be able to know about them, use them, address the shortages that

07:13:38.520 --> 07:13:45.800
they may be experiencing of teachers in that process. And so that's going to be another big

07:13:45.800 --> 07:13:53.480
part of the process coming up. The ETS negotiations we already heard about. Community schools we'll

07:13:53.480 --> 07:13:59.320
hear about tomorrow. So I'll save comments for that. I'll just add on the special education

07:13:59.320 --> 07:14:07.480
front that in the budget was in addition to some funding for the special education functions

07:14:07.480 --> 07:14:17.240
themselves, expectations for redesign of funding and governance that are part of the anticipated

07:14:17.880 --> 07:14:24.680
activity this coming year for additional investment in special education. Work has been going on in

07:14:24.680 --> 07:14:30.600
the alternative diploma. Many of our students with special education programs, particularly those

07:14:30.600 --> 07:14:36.040
who are taking the alternative assessments have not had a pathway to a diploma that holds up

07:14:36.040 --> 07:14:42.760
their ability to access jobs and go forward in their life in many cases. So that's another thing

07:14:42.760 --> 07:14:48.760
that's being worked on and thought about and talked about to get to the place where many other

07:14:48.760 --> 07:14:54.600
states are where we do have an alternative diploma that allows students to meet the standards of

07:14:54.600 --> 07:15:03.880
ways that are appropriate for their learning differences. And finally, I would just note that

07:15:04.840 --> 07:15:11.080
in the work on pre-K and thank you very much, Member Patia Bronson for helping us get so excited

07:15:11.080 --> 07:15:17.880
about what's coming down the pike there. There is a lot of work going on. I'm part of the kitchen

07:15:17.880 --> 07:15:26.440
cabinet that Sarah Neville Morgan has convened. She's got the most amazing set of interactive

07:15:26.440 --> 07:15:33.080
collaborative partnerships to bring many people around the state, researchers from various places

07:15:33.080 --> 07:15:41.080
and folks who are working on the ground together to get this right and subsidies for training the

07:15:41.160 --> 07:15:46.040
workforce, credentialing and collaboration with the future credentialing commission

07:15:46.760 --> 07:15:53.640
and rethinking or extending, elaborating the pre-K foundations into a framework that goes from

07:15:53.640 --> 07:16:00.680
early childhood all the way through the primary grades are part of that activity. So we've got

07:16:00.680 --> 07:16:06.920
a wonderful start on a very coherent approach there that we're all looking forward to seeing

07:16:07.880 --> 07:16:13.960
unfold and giving all of our learners such a good start on their educational careers.

07:16:15.000 --> 07:16:20.440
With that, this concludes item one. We're going to take up item 16, general public comment.

07:16:21.480 --> 07:16:25.800
Public comment is invited on any matter that's not included on the printed agenda.

07:16:26.360 --> 07:16:31.080
We'll open up the phone line for the public comment queue and members of the public,

07:16:31.800 --> 07:16:36.840
I think we want to see the slide, there it comes. Members of the public wishing to provide comments

07:16:36.840 --> 07:16:43.000
on this item may do so by calling the number shown on the public comment slide using the access that

07:16:43.000 --> 07:16:50.040
is shown there and we'll give it a moment for folks who may want to comment to get themselves

07:16:50.680 --> 07:16:57.000
organized and in the queue. We'll encourage anyone who is wanting to comment to state their name and

07:16:57.000 --> 07:17:01.800
affiliation for the record, turn down the volume on their computer if they're following the live

07:17:01.800 --> 07:17:08.600
feed and limit their comments to a minute each. Do we have any further public comments?

07:17:10.040 --> 07:17:16.280
There are no public comment at this time and this is the Sound of the South officially signing off.

07:17:18.760 --> 07:17:25.000
Thank you very much. We appreciate that. You do such a good job with that in such a polite and

07:17:25.960 --> 07:17:32.440
supportive way to our callers. So this ends today's session and we'll continue our meeting

07:17:32.440 --> 07:17:38.200
beginning with the closed session tomorrow morning to discuss or take action on the following legal

07:17:38.200 --> 07:17:45.240
matters, EE at all, Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund versus State and Related

07:17:45.240 --> 07:17:50.760
University of the United States Department of Justice Complaint and Office of Administrative

07:17:50.840 --> 07:17:56.920
Hearing Complaints and California's for Equal Rights Foundation at all versus the state.

07:17:56.920 --> 07:18:09.320
And with that, I bid you a fond adieu and we'll see you early tomorrow morning at 8.30 a.m.
