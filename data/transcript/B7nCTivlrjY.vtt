00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Good morning, everyone. We're about to convene the January 13th, 14th, 2021 State Board of

00:15.000 --> 00:20.160
Education meeting. And seeing that board members are now present, Brooks, will you please call

00:20.160 --> 00:22.160
the roll to establish the roll?

00:22.160 --> 00:25.160
Of course, good morning. Member Sun.

00:29.160 --> 00:32.160
Here. Thank you. Member Strauss.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.160
Here. Member Rucker.

00:36.160 --> 00:38.160
Present. Member Rodriguez.

00:40.160 --> 00:42.160
Here. Member Patil-Brownson.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.160
Here. Member Navo.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.160
Here. Member McQuillan.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.160

00:56.160 --> 00:58.160
Here. President Darling-Hammond.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.160
Here. Member Burr.

01:02.160 --> 01:06.160
Here. Everyone's present and accounted for.

01:07.160 --> 01:14.160
Thank you. I hereby call the January 2021 meeting of the State Board of Education to order at 8.35 a.m.

01:15.160 --> 01:20.160
And I'd like to commence by saluting the flag. Member Rodriguez, will you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?

01:21.160 --> 01:23.160
Absolutely. Please stand.

01:27.160 --> 01:43.160
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, with liberty and justice for all.

01:44.160 --> 01:45.160
Thank you.

01:45.160 --> 01:51.160
We are ready to begin.

01:52.160 --> 01:58.160
And item one is our State Board projects and priorities item to take up the annual election of officers only.

01:59.160 --> 02:12.160
The State Board of Education staff recommends that the State Board take up annual election of officers and will now hold an election for the position of President and Vice President for 2021.

02:12.160 --> 02:21.160
The bylaws require that the State Superintendent preside over the election of the President and such other business as the State Board may direct, and I'll turn the gavel over to Tony.

02:22.160 --> 02:25.160
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond. Good morning, everyone.

02:25.160 --> 02:35.160
Good morning, everyone. And to also to the public, there is opportunity for public comment during any portion of the election.

02:36.160 --> 02:42.160
If you wish to participate in public comment, the number to call will be provided to you on the screen.

02:42.160 --> 02:54.160
We will now, in keeping with Article 5 of the bylaws for the State Board, I'd like to call for nominations for the Office of President.

02:55.160 --> 02:59.160
No member may nominate or second the nomination for him or herself.

03:00.160 --> 03:10.160
Six votes are necessary to elect an officer, and each officer elected shall serve for one year or until his or her successor is elected.

03:10.160 --> 03:17.160
I'll now open the floor for nominations for the Office of President by their nominations.

03:18.160 --> 03:23.160
So I would like to nominate Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond as President of the State Board of Education.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.160
Is there a second to this nomination?

03:27.160 --> 03:28.160
I second it.

03:29.160 --> 03:36.160
We have a nomination and a second for Linda Darling-Hammond. Is there any public comment?

03:36.160 --> 03:37.160
There is none.

03:39.160 --> 03:41.160
There's no public comment.

03:42.160 --> 03:45.160
Bruce, would you please call the roll?

03:46.160 --> 03:51.160

04:34.160 --> 04:41.160
Congratulations, Linda, and thank you again for being willing to serve in this capacity, especially in these very difficult times.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.160
Congratulations.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.160
Thank you.

04:46.160 --> 04:53.160
Congratulations, Linda, and thank you again for being willing to serve in this capacity, especially in these very difficult times.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.160
Congratulations.

04:55.160 --> 04:59.160
And it is my pleasure to return the virtual gavel back to you.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.160
Thank you so much.

05:01.160 --> 05:02.160
And thanks, everyone.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.160
I appreciate it.

05:03.160 --> 05:06.160
And it's such a wonderful board to work with.

05:06.160 --> 05:12.160
We've been making such amazing progress over these number of years.

05:12.160 --> 05:17.160
I am privileged to be able to work with you over the coming year.

05:18.160 --> 05:25.160
And at this point, in keeping with Article 4 of the State Board's bylaws, I would like to call for nominations for the Office of Vice President.

05:26.160 --> 05:29.160
No member may nominate or second a nomination for himself or herself.

05:30.160 --> 05:38.160
Six votes are necessary to elect an officer, and each officer elected shall serve for one year or until his or her successor is elected.

05:39.160 --> 05:43.160
I will now open the floor for nominations for the Office of Vice President.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.160
Are there nominations?

05:47.160 --> 05:48.160
Member Rodriguez?

05:49.160 --> 05:50.160
I nominate Eileen Strauss.

05:51.160 --> 05:52.160
Is there a second?

05:53.160 --> 05:54.160
I will second.

05:55.160 --> 05:56.160
Thank you very much.

05:58.160 --> 06:01.160
Eileen Strauss has been nominated to the Office of Vice President.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.160
Are there any other nominations?

06:06.160 --> 06:07.160
Hearing none.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.160
Is there any public comment?

06:10.160 --> 06:12.160
We have one person signed up for public comment.

06:13.160 --> 06:14.160
All right.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.160
Thank you.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.160
Caller, you are unmuted.

06:17.160 --> 06:19.160
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:19.160 --> 06:20.160
Your time starts now.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.160
It looks like they just hung up.

06:25.160 --> 06:27.160
So there is no more public comment.

06:28.160 --> 06:29.160
All right.

06:29.160 --> 06:31.160
They probably wanted another item.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.160
Brooks, can you please call the roll?

06:33.160 --> 06:34.160
Let's call the roll.

07:18.160 --> 07:19.160
Congratulations, Eileen.

07:20.160 --> 07:21.160
Thank you so much.

07:21.160 --> 07:27.160
I look forward to working with everybody this year and just so appreciate the collaboration and the work of our team.

07:28.160 --> 07:29.160
Thank you.

07:29.160 --> 07:30.160
I am glad to be here.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.160
Thank you, Eileen.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.160
Thank you, everyone.

07:33.160 --> 07:36.160
Thank you, all of you for your hard work and the work you've done.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.160
Thank you.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.160
And thank you, everyone that's been on the line today.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.160
Thank you.

07:42.160 --> 07:43.160
Thank you.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.160
Thank you.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.160
Thank you.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.160
Thank you, everyone.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.160
Thank you.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.160
Thank you.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.160
Thank you.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.160
Thank you.

recommendations for appointments to the ACCS.

07:56.600 --> 07:59.320
Item five, state educational agency approval

including the allocation formulas,

08:19.480 --> 08:23.360
specific funding amounts, and the number of grant awards,

08:23.360 --> 08:24.840
purposes for grant fund use,

08:24.840 --> 08:27.420

08:28.400 --> 08:33.400
The proposed waiver consent items are W1 through W4.

08:33.720 --> 08:38.720
The proposed regular consent items are items seven through 14.

There are two items that have been withdrawn

08:58.960 --> 09:01.960
In terms of public input, members of the public

09:01.960 --> 09:04.160
wishing to call in for public comment

09:04.160 --> 09:06.040

09:06.040 --> 09:07.520
to know at what time public comment

09:07.520 --> 09:09.600
will occur for each item.

09:09.600 --> 09:12.440
Public comment may be provided by dialing the phone number

09:12.440 --> 09:17.040
that we will put on a slide before each occurrence.

09:18.740 --> 09:21.440
And by entering a participant access code

09:21.440 --> 09:24.000
and following each of the operator's prompts.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.800
Upon dialing in, callers will be added to a caller queue.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.520
The operator will notify callers when it is their turn

09:30.520 --> 09:32.280
to provide public comment.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.280
We will also ask callers to please turn down

09:34.280 --> 09:36.760
the speaker volume on their computers

09:36.760 --> 09:38.560
if they're following the live webcast

09:38.560 --> 09:40.680
to avoid an echoing effect.

09:41.880 --> 09:44.440
Public comment will be limited to one minute

09:44.440 --> 09:46.200
for each speaker.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.640
Item 15 is the general public comment item

09:48.640 --> 09:51.160
during which members of the public may provide comment

09:51.160 --> 09:53.200
on items that are not specifically listed

09:53.200 --> 09:55.080
on the board's agenda.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.040
Board members, please mute your microphones

09:57.040 --> 09:59.800
when not speaking and keep your cameras on at all times

09:59.800 --> 10:01.720
except during the schedule breaks

10:01.720 --> 10:03.360
to ensure that we maintain a quorum

10:03.360 --> 10:05.160
throughout today's virtual meeting.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.000
For each item on the agenda,

10:08.000 --> 10:10.240
there will be an opportunity for you board members

10:10.240 --> 10:14.080
to raise your hand during the Zoom participant window

10:14.120 --> 10:17.600
if you would like to ask a question or make a comment.

10:17.600 --> 10:21.680
So agenda item one is our state board priorities item

10:21.680 --> 10:24.400
and we will only take up the state superintendent's report

10:24.400 --> 10:26.320
and my report at this time

10:26.320 --> 10:29.520
and then we will reopen the item later this afternoon.

10:29.520 --> 10:32.960
I'm now gonna turn it over to Superintendent Tony Thurmond

10:32.960 --> 10:35.040
for his report, Tony.

10:36.160 --> 10:37.880
Thank you, Madam President.

10:37.880 --> 10:40.760
Congratulations again, President Darling-Hammond,

10:40.760 --> 10:42.160
Vice President Strauss.

10:42.160 --> 10:45.760
Thank you both for your steady leadership and stewardship

10:45.760 --> 10:47.880
and it is an honor to continue working with you

10:47.880 --> 10:49.600
and all the members of the board.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.200
To all the members of the board,

10:51.200 --> 10:53.320
this is the first time we're seeing each other this year.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.160
I wanna wish you a happy new year.

10:55.160 --> 10:58.900
I'm hopeful that 2021 is off to a good start.

11:00.080 --> 11:03.440
As you might imagine, our focus continues to be

11:03.440 --> 11:06.720
on how do we keep students and families and educators safe

11:06.720 --> 11:08.240
during the pandemic.

11:08.280 --> 11:11.240
We have continued our conversations

11:11.240 --> 11:16.240
on all phases and all aspects of school reopening.

11:16.860 --> 11:19.360
We've worked closely with the governor

11:19.360 --> 11:21.720
and with President Darling-Hammond

11:21.720 --> 11:26.000
on a number of proposals that will increase COVID testing.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.060
Like everyone, we continue to turn our hope

11:30.060 --> 11:34.720
to seeing the acceleration of the vaccine distribution

11:34.720 --> 11:36.620
so that it reaches our schools.

11:37.580 --> 11:40.140
At least, Constancio and my staff has been serving

11:40.140 --> 11:44.980
on the governor's advisory task force related to vaccines

11:44.980 --> 11:49.980
and also has been serving on the governor's workforce group

11:51.380 --> 11:56.380
to stand up the Valencia lab that will provide COVID testing

11:56.860 --> 11:59.980
for many of our school districts.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.500
We've also just kept our focus

12:01.500 --> 12:03.860
on how do we offset learning gaps

12:03.860 --> 12:06.580
that just are unavoidable

12:06.580 --> 12:09.500
that many students have experienced,

12:09.500 --> 12:11.740
especially students who don't have computers,

12:11.740 --> 12:13.980
students who haven't checked in,

12:13.980 --> 12:16.100
and just students who for whatever reason,

12:16.100 --> 12:18.420
the connection just hasn't been strong enough

12:18.420 --> 12:21.900
if they're not in class with their teachers.

12:21.900 --> 12:23.740
We have literally worked with a number

12:23.740 --> 12:26.860
of our school districts on efforts to engage students

12:26.860 --> 12:28.220
who have not checked in.

12:28.220 --> 12:29.580
That means that a number of our staff

12:29.580 --> 12:33.020
are calling alongside school district staff

12:33.020 --> 12:35.980
to families where students haven't checked in.

12:35.980 --> 12:39.460
We put together webinars for the field

12:39.460 --> 12:41.380
where we work with equity advocates

12:41.380 --> 12:46.180
like Etrus West and PK and families together

12:46.180 --> 12:51.180
to show our schools how to maximize distance learning,

12:53.300 --> 12:56.740
to find ways to support our students in distance learning,

12:56.740 --> 12:59.020
to make sure our families are the most engaged

12:59.020 --> 13:02.940
they can be so that we have ways to offset learning gaps.

13:03.900 --> 13:05.540
We put on a webinar

13:05.540 --> 13:07.860
addressing the mental health needs of our students,

13:07.860 --> 13:10.340
a social emotional learning webinar

13:10.340 --> 13:14.740
with experts who deliver social emotional learning strategies.

13:14.740 --> 13:17.900
More than a thousand educators participating

13:17.900 --> 13:20.420
in that webinar and in that training.

13:20.420 --> 13:22.940
We intend to continue our conversation

13:22.940 --> 13:25.060
with school districts about strategies

13:25.060 --> 13:27.380
that they can use to offset learning gaps

13:27.380 --> 13:29.740
on January 21st at 4.

13:29.740 --> 13:31.100
We'll put on the next webinar

13:31.380 --> 13:32.340
a number of experts,

13:32.340 --> 13:34.700
including our own president Linda Darling-Hammond

13:34.700 --> 13:38.460
to share examples of ways to offset learning gaps,

13:38.460 --> 13:41.620
whether it's through small group or coaching for teachers,

13:41.620 --> 13:44.460
what we do during extended learning time,

13:44.460 --> 13:45.660
what we do during the summer.

13:45.660 --> 13:47.820
We know that there'll be many opportunities

13:47.820 --> 13:50.140
that we must pursue starting right away

13:50.140 --> 13:53.380
to really continue our work to offset learning grants.

13:53.380 --> 13:56.580
And we've repurposed some grants that we've received

13:56.580 --> 13:59.540
to provide more resources to the field.

13:59.580 --> 14:01.180
And we've just announced the grant

14:01.180 --> 14:02.860
that we call the equity grant

14:02.860 --> 14:05.100
that really gives resources to school districts

14:05.100 --> 14:07.060
to do anything that will help them

14:07.060 --> 14:08.340
in offsetting learning grants.

14:08.340 --> 14:10.940
That can be for professional development,

14:10.940 --> 14:13.180
it can be for family engagement work.

14:13.180 --> 14:15.820
And so we announced those grants

14:15.820 --> 14:20.020
and have received more than 470 applicants,

14:20.020 --> 14:22.940
all districts asking for support

14:22.940 --> 14:26.340
so that they can do work to offset equity grants.

14:26.340 --> 14:29.820
We intend to be meeting with the equity staff

14:29.820 --> 14:31.740
of each of our thousand districts.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.740
We've invited them to participate

14:33.740 --> 14:35.820
in what we're calling an equity webinar.

14:35.820 --> 14:39.060
It's really a listening session for us to work together

14:39.060 --> 14:41.900
with many of the folks who are working at the field level

14:41.900 --> 14:43.740
on what they're seeing and hearing

14:43.740 --> 14:45.820
that can allow us to continue our work

14:45.820 --> 14:49.220
to close equity gaps to support students.

14:49.220 --> 14:51.740
And we continue our effort

14:51.740 --> 14:54.100
in the face of mounting violence

14:54.140 --> 14:58.340
that we've seen in the Capitol against our lawmakers,

14:59.660 --> 15:03.580
the actions of white supremacy in our nation's Capitol.

15:03.580 --> 15:05.300
In the backdrop of all these things,

15:05.300 --> 15:08.940
we continue our conversation around

15:08.940 --> 15:12.100
how do we use education to end hate?

15:12.100 --> 15:13.500
And just on yesterday,

15:13.500 --> 15:17.100
we held our third installment in the conversation

15:17.100 --> 15:21.380
where we led a conversation with great partners

15:21.420 --> 15:25.220
about how do we counter Islamophobia in our schools,

15:25.220 --> 15:27.940
recognizing that many of our students are bullied

15:27.940 --> 15:30.900
for their faith, recognizing that even though

15:30.900 --> 15:34.060
our standards are clear on what we teach about religion,

15:34.060 --> 15:39.060
sometimes in schools, our students who practice Islam

15:39.060 --> 15:41.220
experience the wrong things being taught

15:41.220 --> 15:43.300
and things that reinforce stereotypes.

15:43.300 --> 15:47.740
This conversation follows up two other webinars

15:47.740 --> 15:49.260
and in services that we've provided.

15:49.260 --> 15:51.500
One that focuses on what we teach

15:51.500 --> 15:53.300
about Native American history

15:53.300 --> 15:54.980
and to Native American students.

15:54.980 --> 15:56.940
And another that we focus on

15:56.940 --> 15:59.300
how do we counter antisemitism?

15:59.300 --> 16:01.740
We know that in the last few months and years,

16:01.740 --> 16:04.620
we've really seen an increase in acts of hate.

16:04.620 --> 16:08.260
And in many cases, the largest number of acts of hate

16:08.260 --> 16:10.540
that impact our schools have been

16:11.580 --> 16:15.380
in the areas of antisemitism and Islamophobia.

16:15.380 --> 16:18.100
We intend to continue doing more webinars

16:18.100 --> 16:21.020
where we address the issues of racism

16:21.020 --> 16:23.380
in the spirit of Black Lives Matter

16:23.380 --> 16:25.540
and the ongoing racism

16:25.540 --> 16:28.140
that many of our students of color experience.

16:28.140 --> 16:33.060
The focus on how we support LGBTQ students from bullying,

16:33.060 --> 16:34.140
we intend to do this.

16:34.140 --> 16:36.820
And all of this is part and parcel

16:36.820 --> 16:39.060
with a number of grants that we provide

16:39.060 --> 16:42.580
at the school districts to allow them at the local level

16:42.580 --> 16:44.740
to provide their own professional development

16:44.740 --> 16:48.740
to address implicit bias, explicit bias,

16:48.740 --> 16:52.900
and to continue to use education to end hate.

16:53.820 --> 16:56.780
We'll be giving you an email with some press releases

16:56.780 --> 16:59.620
so that you can see the folks that we celebrated

16:59.620 --> 17:01.940
over the course of the last several weeks.

17:01.940 --> 17:05.780
We celebrated the classified employees of the year,

17:05.780 --> 17:07.660
a number of wonderful folks,

17:07.660 --> 17:10.780
custodians, folks in maintenance,

17:10.780 --> 17:12.340
folks who work in the office.

17:13.100 --> 17:17.380
We want to share with you who these wonderful leaders are

17:17.380 --> 17:20.820
who've been doing longstanding service across the state,

17:20.820 --> 17:23.220
like teachers committed and dedicated

17:23.220 --> 17:25.180
to the wellbeing of our students.

17:25.180 --> 17:27.260
We wanna share with you the winners

17:27.260 --> 17:29.900
of the Presidential Awards in excellence.

17:29.900 --> 17:31.860
You'll be receiving copies of that,

17:31.860 --> 17:34.900
as well as the schools that have been selected

17:34.900 --> 17:37.380
for the National Distinguished Schools Awards.

17:37.380 --> 17:39.900
And so you'll be getting copies of all of these.

17:39.900 --> 17:42.140
We wanna, even in these tough times,

17:42.980 --> 17:44.940
continue to celebrate those who bring forward

17:44.940 --> 17:46.980
innovation and commitment

17:46.980 --> 17:49.620
to supporting our students and our schools.

17:49.620 --> 17:51.540
And finally, I wanna share with you some new faces

17:51.540 --> 17:54.780
that you'll see on the CDE team.

17:54.780 --> 17:59.780
Many of you know that we have had some grants

17:59.820 --> 18:02.820
that we've been able to receive during the pandemic,

18:05.420 --> 18:07.180
upwards of $5 million,

18:07.180 --> 18:10.180
and we've turned those grants into opportunities

18:10.180 --> 18:12.340
for us to support schools.

18:12.340 --> 18:13.780
All of these webinars,

18:13.780 --> 18:17.460
all of these, the focus on addressing implicit bias,

18:17.460 --> 18:19.940
the manner in which we try to work with our school districts

18:19.940 --> 18:22.380
on some new things like family engagement,

18:22.380 --> 18:25.020
largely supported by these grants.

18:25.020 --> 18:28.100
Wanna acknowledge that we had our HR director,

18:28.100 --> 18:31.980
Valerie, has retired after serving CDE for 30-some years.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.420
Thank you, Valerie.

18:33.420 --> 18:34.740
And so many of you will,

18:34.740 --> 18:38.100
I'm sure many of you knew her and know her.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.660
We're pleased that you'll now have the opportunity

18:40.660 --> 18:43.820
to work with our new HR director, Shonda Bell,

18:43.820 --> 18:47.460
who comes to us after being in a similar role

18:47.460 --> 18:49.300
at the Department of Motor Vehicles

18:49.300 --> 18:51.300
and has already hit the ground running

18:51.300 --> 18:53.260
and working to help us innovate

18:53.260 --> 18:56.020
a number of our practices in HR.

18:56.020 --> 19:01.020
A big focus for us is how do we create equity in our hiring?

19:01.060 --> 19:04.140
And so Shonda has gone to work on that.

19:04.140 --> 19:06.460
She will be aided by a new deputy superintendent

19:06.500 --> 19:08.500
who we're pleased to bring on,

19:08.500 --> 19:11.700
who will also focus on human resources issues

19:11.700 --> 19:13.980
and strengthening the work that we do with our labor

19:13.980 --> 19:16.580
and management partners at the state level.

19:16.580 --> 19:20.540
She's a former teacher, principal,

19:20.540 --> 19:23.420
and most recently served as the deputy superintendent

19:23.420 --> 19:26.100
for human resources at Contra Costa County.

19:26.100 --> 19:29.020
That's Cheryl Cotton, who will be joining us shortly.

19:29.020 --> 19:31.780
And again, will be someone who will be available to help us

19:31.780 --> 19:35.100
as we work on diversity issues.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.660
We also have brought on another deputy superintendent

19:37.660 --> 19:40.460
who will be helping us with a number of special projects.

19:40.460 --> 19:41.780
Her name is Jenny Carreon,

19:41.780 --> 19:43.980
and she joins us from the healthcare field

19:43.980 --> 19:47.980
working at one of the largest federally qualified FQHCs

19:49.780 --> 19:52.820
in Southern California and brings a health background

19:52.820 --> 19:56.260
that is helping us as we continue to try and steady the work

19:56.260 --> 20:00.140
around helping districts, how they safely open.

20:00.140 --> 20:01.740
She's on board and has been helping us

20:01.780 --> 20:05.740
with our initiatives to address chronic absenteeism

20:05.740 --> 20:07.860
of those students who've not checked in.

20:07.860 --> 20:10.500
In a similar way, we brought on a new director

20:10.500 --> 20:12.660
for family engagement, Lisa Borrego,

20:12.660 --> 20:14.980
who joins us from the district level

20:14.980 --> 20:17.860
where she has focused on family engagement.

20:17.860 --> 20:21.980
She's already organized an incredible campaign

20:21.980 --> 20:23.700
to help us in helping districts

20:23.700 --> 20:27.460
who've seen attendance challenges exacerbated

20:27.460 --> 20:29.500
through the pandemic.

20:29.500 --> 20:32.620
Also, Pamela Kadakia, who's joined us

20:32.620 --> 20:34.260
in working on our equity effort.

20:34.260 --> 20:38.820
She's been leading our webinars on education to end hate,

20:38.820 --> 20:42.540
has done incredible work with our grant series.

20:42.540 --> 20:45.940
And Dr. Michael Ishimoto, who joins us in the capacity

20:45.940 --> 20:48.300
of helping us to expand research

20:48.300 --> 20:51.500
that we can use to benefit districts.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.380
You'll have a chance to meet all of these folks,

20:53.380 --> 20:54.340
but we wanted to let you know

20:54.340 --> 20:58.100
that through a series of grants opportunities,

20:58.100 --> 21:01.540
we've been able to build out the capacity of CDE

21:01.540 --> 21:03.740
to help our districts a bit more.

21:03.740 --> 21:04.980
And so this concludes my report.

21:04.980 --> 21:06.580
As always, I'm happy to take any questions

21:06.580 --> 21:07.500
that you may have.

21:09.260 --> 21:11.580
Thank you so much.

21:11.580 --> 21:16.180
And we welcome all of these new colleagues to the effort.

21:16.180 --> 21:19.420
And I thank you for all of the intensive work

21:19.420 --> 21:23.020
that the department has been undertaking.

21:23.020 --> 21:26.420
And I just wanna underscore that that conversation

21:26.420 --> 21:30.100
that you've been leading against racism and hate

21:30.100 --> 21:33.260
and for mutual understanding and unity

21:33.260 --> 21:35.140
is so very important right now.

21:35.140 --> 21:36.860
We really appreciate it.

21:38.420 --> 21:43.100
These are challenging times for California and our nation.

21:43.100 --> 21:46.780
We're in the midst of a public health crisis,

21:46.780 --> 21:50.060
an economic crisis, a long overdue reckoning

21:50.060 --> 21:53.180
with racial injustice and a crisis of confidence

21:53.180 --> 21:55.820
in our democratic system of government.

21:55.820 --> 21:59.220
And we know that a strong public education system

21:59.220 --> 22:02.980
is critical to addressing all of these crises

22:02.980 --> 22:05.660
and that that's really part of our charge.

22:05.660 --> 22:09.620
The pandemic has, as Superintendent Thurmond noted,

22:09.620 --> 22:13.220
exacerbated the inequities of society and education.

22:13.220 --> 22:14.660
Even before the pandemic,

22:14.660 --> 22:15.940
many schools were struggling

22:15.940 --> 22:18.060
to meet the needs of all learners.

22:18.060 --> 22:20.660
And when learning was disrupted in March,

22:20.660 --> 22:23.460
the vital role that schools play became clear.

22:23.460 --> 22:25.700
Our economy and many households

22:25.700 --> 22:27.860
cannot function without them.

22:27.860 --> 22:30.340
With no time to prepare, educators stepped up

22:30.340 --> 22:33.260
to provide access to remote learning,

22:33.260 --> 22:37.020
to food and to a variety of other services.

22:37.020 --> 22:40.180
And we will need to do still more.

22:40.180 --> 22:41.300
Over the last year,

22:41.300 --> 22:45.580
California lost 1.3 million non-farm jobs.

22:45.580 --> 22:47.620
And those job losses have triggered

22:47.620 --> 22:49.460
for many of our students.

22:49.460 --> 22:52.660
Housing insecurity, greater food insecurity

22:52.660 --> 22:56.060
and other challenges that have a devastating impact

22:56.060 --> 22:58.780
on the physical and mental health of family members,

22:58.780 --> 23:00.620
including children.

23:00.620 --> 23:02.540
We're going to need to wrap around them

23:02.540 --> 23:06.060
with social and emotional as well as academic resources

23:06.060 --> 23:08.500
and with social services that connect their families

23:08.500 --> 23:11.620
to secure havens and supports.

23:11.620 --> 23:12.980
That's why it's so important

23:12.980 --> 23:16.260
that the governor proposed the largest investment ever

23:16.260 --> 23:19.740
in TK through 12 public education last week.

23:19.740 --> 23:24.660
At $85 billion, nearly $15 billion more than last year.

23:24.660 --> 23:28.860
This budget also includes more than $300 million

23:28.860 --> 23:31.540
for student mental health and community schools

23:31.540 --> 23:33.780
that provide wraparound services,

23:33.780 --> 23:36.020
as well as school climate surveys

23:36.020 --> 23:38.380
to help us keep track of and respond

23:38.380 --> 23:41.340
to what students are experiencing.

23:41.340 --> 23:43.700
We know that community schools can play a huge role

23:43.700 --> 23:46.980
in reducing the impacts of the pandemic

23:47.020 --> 23:50.700
by connecting families to needed services,

23:50.700 --> 23:54.660
by keeping a very personalized eye

23:54.660 --> 23:56.820
on the welfare of each child,

23:56.820 --> 24:01.100
by ensuring that they're connected to and engaged in school

24:01.100 --> 24:06.100
and the capacity to expand that way of working with

24:07.020 --> 24:10.500
children and families is going to be very important for us

24:10.500 --> 24:14.700
coming through the pandemic with families and children

24:14.700 --> 24:17.340
intact and engaged in school.

24:17.340 --> 24:21.020
As we see that COVID levels will eventually recede

24:21.020 --> 24:23.860
and vaccinations are beginning to roll out,

24:23.860 --> 24:26.820
we will find ourselves at a crossroads.

24:26.820 --> 24:28.780
One of the things that we need to think about

24:28.780 --> 24:31.500
as we take up issues here at the state board

24:31.500 --> 24:34.020
and in the department is whether we will revert

24:34.020 --> 24:35.940
to the system as we've known it,

24:35.940 --> 24:38.580
or will we take steps to transform the system

24:38.580 --> 24:41.140
in ways that will improve education

24:41.140 --> 24:43.300
for students in California.

24:43.300 --> 24:46.020
California has an opportunity to use the disruption

24:46.020 --> 24:49.580
created by the pandemic to turn a new way forward,

24:49.580 --> 24:53.140
to make schools more equitable, more socially responsive

24:53.140 --> 24:55.340
and more academically engaging

24:55.340 --> 24:58.340
than some of them may have been before.

24:58.340 --> 25:01.740
We must use the next few months to prepare to move forward.

25:01.740 --> 25:03.940
And this means rethinking the way in which we use

25:03.940 --> 25:06.660
the school day and the school year to support

25:06.660 --> 25:09.700
and educate students to maximum advantage,

25:09.700 --> 25:12.460
creating conditions for more humane, more caring,

25:12.500 --> 25:15.580
more equitable teaching and learning.

25:15.580 --> 25:18.260
It is the time for us to move beyond the assumptions

25:18.260 --> 25:19.940
of the agrarian school calendar

25:19.940 --> 25:23.900
that is no longer really relevant to today's economy,

25:23.900 --> 25:26.300
to move beyond the notion that schooling

25:26.300 --> 25:28.620
is a standardized march through fixed content

25:28.620 --> 25:30.660
that's the same for every child,

25:30.660 --> 25:33.300
whether or not it meets their needs.

25:33.300 --> 25:38.300
The governor's budget also includes $4.6 billion in funds

25:38.300 --> 25:40.900
for targeted academic supports and interventions

25:40.900 --> 25:44.300
that are personalized to the needs of students

25:44.300 --> 25:47.020
and for expanding education into the summer

25:47.020 --> 25:49.780
through extended school year or summer school,

25:49.780 --> 25:51.780
a variety of vehicles.

25:51.780 --> 25:55.460
These types of interventions will be critically important

25:55.460 --> 25:57.020
to accelerating learning,

25:57.020 --> 25:59.420
especially for our youngest learners,

25:59.420 --> 26:01.940
but really for all of our learners.

26:01.940 --> 26:04.340
We also know that beyond adding time,

26:04.340 --> 26:06.900
students only thrive in a rich learning environment

26:06.900 --> 26:08.820
in which they feel valued and purposeful

26:08.940 --> 26:11.260
and they're engaged in meaningful learning

26:11.260 --> 26:12.860
and extra support and tutoring

26:12.860 --> 26:15.180
are only part of the solution.

26:15.180 --> 26:17.380
We need to continue to support educators

26:17.380 --> 26:20.140
to provide deeper learning experiences

26:20.140 --> 26:23.220
that are relevant, exciting and connected to students lives

26:23.220 --> 26:25.860
while they continue to redesign schools

26:25.860 --> 26:27.860
that are centered on relationships.

26:27.860 --> 26:29.460
And across our state,

26:29.460 --> 26:32.900
educators have been inventing a variety of ways

26:32.900 --> 26:36.620
to be connecting one-on-one with students, with families,

26:36.620 --> 26:41.220
to be creating the kind of engaging learning experiences

26:41.220 --> 26:45.340
that make students want to be learning on their own

26:45.340 --> 26:47.060
as well as together.

26:47.060 --> 26:51.900
And we need to figure out ways to capture those inventions

26:51.900 --> 26:54.500
to allow for and support

26:54.500 --> 26:56.940
educator to educator learning opportunities

26:56.940 --> 27:00.540
that are proliferating across the state

27:00.540 --> 27:04.140
and to enable strong relationships to be catalytic

27:04.140 --> 27:08.620
for engaging previously disconnected students.

27:08.620 --> 27:11.940
So the budget does include $250 million

27:11.940 --> 27:14.460
for professional learning opportunities

27:14.460 --> 27:17.660
that will include the supports for teaching

27:17.660 --> 27:20.620
to accelerate learning in the content areas

27:20.620 --> 27:22.660
as well as for social emotional learning

27:22.660 --> 27:26.260
and restorative practices, implicit bias training,

27:26.260 --> 27:29.180
ethnic studies and other tools

27:29.180 --> 27:33.180
to ensure that students see themselves in school

27:33.180 --> 27:38.020
and feel connected to and engaged in what's going on there.

27:38.020 --> 27:40.380
It is also why our efforts to provide guidance

27:40.380 --> 27:43.780
for remote learning, which you'll hear about later today,

27:43.780 --> 27:46.420
focus on making the curriculum more meaningful

27:46.420 --> 27:48.820
and motivating as well as well supported

27:48.820 --> 27:51.660
with innovative uses of technologies

27:51.660 --> 27:53.620
that we should bring back with us

27:53.620 --> 27:56.460
into brick and mortar settings.

27:56.460 --> 28:00.180
Of course, the pandemic is not the only major challenge

28:00.180 --> 28:02.740
that our society is facing right now.

28:02.740 --> 28:05.740
Our entire democracy was challenged last week

28:05.740 --> 28:09.020
with the insurrection at the Capitol in Washington.

28:09.020 --> 28:12.420
The dire need for a commitment to civic education

28:12.420 --> 28:14.420
could not have been clearer.

28:14.420 --> 28:17.060
And we need to rebuild the nation's common ground

28:17.060 --> 28:20.260
and its commitment to a democratic way of life.

28:20.260 --> 28:22.900
Our recent actions to adopt criteria

28:22.900 --> 28:25.260
for the state seal of civic engagement

28:25.260 --> 28:27.460
and to stimulate civic learning and engagement

28:27.460 --> 28:30.980
throughout our schools from TK all the way up to high school

28:30.980 --> 28:33.220
are more important than ever.

28:33.220 --> 28:35.700
This effort to bring civics knowledge and commitment

28:35.700 --> 28:38.860
to our core values alive is needed to create

28:38.860 --> 28:42.380
the common understandings that hold our people together.

28:43.260 --> 28:44.980
This week, the California history

28:44.980 --> 28:47.260
social science subject matter project

28:47.260 --> 28:50.380
invited all educators in California to join with us

28:50.380 --> 28:52.580
to discuss what we can do to help students

28:52.580 --> 28:55.420
make sense of this moment and to empower them

28:55.420 --> 28:58.540
to advocate for democracy, justice,

28:58.540 --> 29:00.740
and end to racism and hate

29:00.740 --> 29:03.340
and build a better future for all of us.

29:03.340 --> 29:05.780
That really does sum up our charge

29:05.780 --> 29:09.180
to help our schools build a better future for all of us.

29:09.180 --> 29:12.460
And the new administration arriving next week in Washington

29:12.460 --> 29:14.860
is equally committed to that goal.

29:14.860 --> 29:18.100
So even though we are still in the throes of this pandemic,

29:18.100 --> 29:20.300
there is a new day dawning.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.860
It is in these moments of crisis

29:22.860 --> 29:25.540
that great transformations are possible.

29:25.540 --> 29:27.380
And I urge us to seize this moment

29:27.380 --> 29:28.220
to continue.

29:42.340 --> 29:43.260
Linda, I apologize.

29:43.260 --> 29:44.460
I think you're on mute.

29:47.860 --> 29:50.980
Was I on mute for that entire conversation?

29:50.980 --> 29:53.380
After seize the moment.

29:54.340 --> 29:55.820
Okay, I went on mute.

29:58.180 --> 29:59.140
So what did I say?

29:59.140 --> 30:01.580
To seize the moment to continue our work

30:01.580 --> 30:03.860
to transform our public education system

30:04.860 --> 30:07.020
to one that is more equitable and empowering

30:07.020 --> 30:08.380
for all of our children.

30:09.220 --> 30:10.060
Thank you.

30:11.540 --> 30:14.740
And with that, we'll move to agenda item number two,

30:16.140 --> 30:17.820
which is the distance learning curriculum

30:17.820 --> 30:20.980
and instructional guidance project update,

30:20.980 --> 30:23.940
which I actually was just referencing.

30:23.940 --> 30:26.500
This is not an action item.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.620
It is being presented for information only,

30:28.620 --> 30:32.220
and it will be presented by Shanine Coates of the CDE,

30:32.220 --> 30:34.460
along with Nancy Harada and Dave Gordon

30:34.460 --> 30:37.220
of Sacramento County Office of Education,

30:37.220 --> 30:39.860
Joe Bowler of Stanford University,

30:39.860 --> 30:43.220
Hallie Yopp of California State University of Fullerton,

30:43.220 --> 30:45.380
Richard Culotta of the International Society

30:45.380 --> 30:47.660
for Technology and Education.

30:47.660 --> 30:51.060
So Shanine and Hallie, please, yeah.

30:51.700 --> 30:56.700
Good morning, Board President Darling-Hammond,

30:57.460 --> 31:00.740
Vice President Strauss, and esteemed members of the Board.

31:00.740 --> 31:03.260
I'm Shanine Coates, Director of the Curriculum Frameworks

31:03.260 --> 31:05.540
and Instructional Resources Division,

31:05.540 --> 31:08.700
and I am joined by my colleagues to provide an update

31:08.700 --> 31:11.020
on the distance learning guidance project

31:11.020 --> 31:15.060
that was authorized as part of Senate Bill 98.

31:16.140 --> 31:17.180
Next slide, please.

31:19.100 --> 31:20.260
I'll just give a moment.

31:22.060 --> 31:25.860
Thank you.

31:28.900 --> 31:31.740
Educators will never forget March 2020

31:31.740 --> 31:35.380
when the world began responding to COVID-19,

31:35.380 --> 31:39.420
including physical school closures and social distancing.

31:39.420 --> 31:42.260
Educators, schools, and districts, communities, families,

31:42.260 --> 31:45.380
and students went into problem-solving mode

31:45.380 --> 31:48.700
to rise to the occasion of how to provide high quality

31:48.700 --> 31:51.860
first instruction in a remote setting.

31:51.860 --> 31:53.260
For many districts and schools,

31:53.260 --> 31:55.060
the pandemic served as the impetus

31:55.060 --> 31:57.260
to shift to one-to-one devices.

31:57.260 --> 31:59.100
What we've seen in the field of education

31:59.100 --> 32:01.580
over the last year is the ultimate display

32:01.580 --> 32:04.580
of heartening resilience in a time of extreme change.

32:04.580 --> 32:07.700
Now that we are moving towards more schools reopening,

32:07.700 --> 32:10.580
distance learning guidance is still very relevant.

32:10.580 --> 32:13.420
Even with the vaccine, some students will remain

32:13.420 --> 32:16.820
and continue in remote learning or hybrid learning settings.

32:16.820 --> 32:18.060
Despite its devastation,

32:18.060 --> 32:19.500
and even in light of the inequities

32:19.500 --> 32:20.540
that have been highlighted,

32:20.540 --> 32:24.700
COVID-19 brought us to the brink of a unique opportunity

32:24.700 --> 32:27.300
to set the foundation for the future of education

32:27.300 --> 32:29.180
based on what we've learned.

32:29.180 --> 32:32.740
We as educators are at a pivotal moment in time.

32:32.740 --> 32:35.300
We hold the potential to change our trajectory,

32:35.300 --> 32:37.540
to identify evidence-based policies

32:37.540 --> 32:39.860
to inform a sustainable learning model

32:39.860 --> 32:41.740
that allows for flexibility,

32:41.740 --> 32:45.220
where digital learning serves as a key component

32:45.220 --> 32:48.620
for how we build student-centered learning opportunities

32:48.620 --> 32:50.940
and create spaces that cultivate support

32:50.940 --> 32:53.260
and inspire lifelong learners.

32:53.260 --> 32:54.740
This guidance will assist teachers

32:54.740 --> 32:58.100
as they continue to integrate technology into the classroom,

32:58.100 --> 33:01.540
even in what we hope to be a post-COVID world.

33:01.540 --> 33:05.260
Section 121 of Senate Bill 98 appropriated funding

33:05.260 --> 33:07.900
to the Sacramento County Office of Education

33:07.900 --> 33:10.980
to develop a draft distance learning curriculum

33:10.980 --> 33:13.060
and instructional guidance for mathematics,

33:13.060 --> 33:15.900
English language arts, English language development,

33:15.900 --> 33:18.300
including guidance around social emotional learning

33:18.300 --> 33:19.540
and assessments.

33:19.540 --> 33:21.740
This guidance will come before you,

33:21.740 --> 33:24.500
the state board, in May 2021.

33:24.500 --> 33:27.260
Today, we would like to provide an update on this work,

33:27.260 --> 33:29.340
as well as receive your input.

33:29.340 --> 33:30.740
Next slide, please.

33:30.740 --> 33:34.220
I am joined by several members of the project's leadership

33:34.220 --> 33:36.380
and content development team.

33:36.380 --> 33:38.780
At this time, I would like to turn it over

33:38.780 --> 33:42.060
to the Sacramento County Office of Education

33:42.060 --> 33:44.060
Superintendent, David Gordon,

33:44.060 --> 33:46.140
to introduce the leadership team.

33:46.140 --> 33:47.540
Superintendent Gordon.

33:52.140 --> 33:54.020
Thank you very much, Shanee.

33:54.020 --> 33:55.140
Am I on camera?

34:01.620 --> 34:03.540
I do not see you on camera, sir.

34:12.100 --> 34:15.140
Okay, I guess I'm not on camera, but thank you.

34:15.140 --> 34:15.980
Thank you, Shanee.

34:15.980 --> 34:18.020
I'm Dave Gordon,

34:18.020 --> 34:20.660
Sacramento County Superintendent of Schools,

34:20.660 --> 34:25.820
and I want to congratulate President Darling-Hammond

34:25.820 --> 34:29.660
and Vice President Strauss on your election.

34:31.980 --> 34:35.140
And between you and Superintendent Thurmond,

34:35.140 --> 34:38.460
we are so grateful for the strong leadership

34:38.460 --> 34:40.620
and the leadership that you have.

34:40.700 --> 34:43.220
For the strong leadership that you provided

34:43.220 --> 34:45.140
and continue to provide.

34:45.140 --> 34:47.180
It's much appreciated.

34:47.180 --> 34:49.700
SCOE has convened a strong team

34:49.700 --> 34:52.300
to develop the distance learning curriculum

34:52.300 --> 34:54.700
and instructional guidance.

34:54.700 --> 34:57.740
We have contracted with the International Society

34:57.740 --> 35:02.700
for Technology in Education, known as ITSE,

35:02.700 --> 35:05.220
to serve as the lead organization,

35:05.220 --> 35:08.620
coordinate the writing team, and draft the final product.

35:09.620 --> 35:13.140
We're also working with computer using educators,

35:13.140 --> 35:18.140
known as Q, that has extensive technology expertise

35:18.420 --> 35:22.100
working with educators, specifically in California.

35:23.580 --> 35:26.180
An important component of the work includes

35:26.180 --> 35:30.100
the identification of critical standards in mathematics

35:30.100 --> 35:33.860
and English language arts, English language development.

35:33.860 --> 35:36.820
And we're very pleased to have convened a team

35:37.020 --> 35:41.460
of nationally recognized experts for these content areas

35:41.460 --> 35:46.340
that includes, for ELA, ELD, Dr. Halley Yopp,

35:46.340 --> 35:51.340
Nancy Brindleson, Dr. Douglas Fisher, and Dr. Nancy Frye.

35:51.780 --> 35:56.620
For mathematics, Dr. Joe Bowler and Cathy Ann Williams.

35:56.620 --> 36:00.900
And for distance learning, Dr. Catherine Kennedy from ISTE.

36:01.940 --> 36:05.940
And now I'm pleased to turn it over to Dr. Nancy Gerota,

36:05.980 --> 36:08.580
our Deputy Superintendent at SCOE,

36:08.580 --> 36:11.020
to provide an overview of the project.

36:12.780 --> 36:14.340
Thank you, Superintendent Gordon.

36:14.340 --> 36:17.700
If you can switch to the next slide.

36:17.700 --> 36:18.860
Thank you.

36:18.860 --> 36:20.900
So what I'd like to do is to begin

36:20.900 --> 36:24.620
with providing a broad overview of the content areas

36:24.620 --> 36:26.740
that will be included in this guide.

36:26.740 --> 36:30.740
I will then describe the structures and the processes

36:30.740 --> 36:33.460
that we have put in place to gather input

36:33.460 --> 36:35.500
in the development of this guide.

36:36.020 --> 36:38.780
And then we will move into these sections

36:38.780 --> 36:41.820
that are currently under development.

36:41.820 --> 36:45.620
So as you can see on the slide, Senate Bill 98 calls

36:45.620 --> 36:48.820
for the development of a distance learning curriculum

36:48.820 --> 36:51.780
and instructional guidance for mathematics,

36:51.780 --> 36:55.140
English language arts, and English language development.

36:55.140 --> 36:58.540
This guidance document will include a framework

36:58.540 --> 37:02.740
for addressing critical standards in the area of mathematics,

37:02.740 --> 37:07.220
English language arts, and English language development.

37:07.220 --> 37:10.260
This document will also include guidance

37:10.260 --> 37:14.140
in the area of formative and diagnostic assessment,

37:14.140 --> 37:17.740
and will provide recommendations for aggregating time

37:17.740 --> 37:21.300
for instruction and independent work by grade span.

37:22.740 --> 37:25.580
Another key component of this document

37:25.580 --> 37:29.540
will be the inclusion of strategies to support

37:29.540 --> 37:32.260
social emotional learning for our students

37:32.260 --> 37:34.540
in an early learning department,

37:34.540 --> 37:36.940
in a distance learning environment.

37:36.940 --> 37:39.180
And I think it's important to note here

37:39.180 --> 37:43.740
that we are coordinating our efforts with the team at CDE

37:43.740 --> 37:47.860
who is leading the state's social emotional learning team.

37:47.860 --> 37:50.940
And here at the Sacramento County Office of Education,

37:50.940 --> 37:54.260
we have our assistant superintendent, Brent Mallicoat,

37:54.260 --> 37:56.260
who serves on the state SEL team.

37:56.260 --> 38:00.740
So we are ensuring that we are aligning our efforts.

38:00.740 --> 38:04.500
This guidance resource will also include

38:04.500 --> 38:06.820
the importance of approaches

38:06.820 --> 38:09.380
to meet the needs of all students.

38:09.380 --> 38:12.860
So there will be sections focused on meeting the needs

38:12.860 --> 38:15.940
of students with disabilities, English learners,

38:15.940 --> 38:18.740
as well as other vulnerable groups.

38:18.740 --> 38:22.540
We will also be addressing strategies to accelerate learning

38:22.540 --> 38:25.260
to address the mitigation of learning loss.

38:25.260 --> 38:27.220
And we are working with partners

38:27.220 --> 38:31.740
to identify high quality online interactive materials

38:31.740 --> 38:34.180
that will be embedded throughout the document.

38:36.620 --> 38:41.620
This provides an overview of the organizational structure

38:41.740 --> 38:44.620
that we have developed to move forward with this work.

38:44.620 --> 38:48.420
And we're very, very pleased with the strong infrastructure

38:48.420 --> 38:50.180
that we have put in place.

38:50.180 --> 38:54.860
We are working, as you can see, with both ISTE and Q,

38:54.860 --> 38:58.740
their leadership and expertise in the area

38:58.740 --> 39:01.780
of the use of technology and education

39:01.780 --> 39:05.020
are recognized at the international, national,

39:05.020 --> 39:06.300
and state level.

39:06.300 --> 39:08.380
And we are just so pleased to be working

39:08.380 --> 39:12.220
with both organizations to help lead this effort.

39:12.220 --> 39:15.100
As Superintendent Gordon highlighted,

39:15.100 --> 39:18.540
we also have nationally recognized experts

39:18.540 --> 39:22.700
in the areas of mathematics and ELA, ELD.

39:22.700 --> 39:25.380
And for the area of mathematics,

39:25.380 --> 39:30.220
Dr. Jo Buller is the lead writer for this section.

39:30.220 --> 39:34.220
And not only is she a nationally recognized expert,

39:34.220 --> 39:37.260
but what's important to note is that she's also part

39:37.260 --> 39:40.980
of the committee convened by the CDE

39:40.980 --> 39:44.060
that is working on the revisions to the math framework.

39:44.060 --> 39:47.500
So that connection was critically important in our work.

39:47.500 --> 39:51.540
For the ELA, ELD section, Dr. Halley Yopp

39:51.580 --> 39:54.460
and Nancy Bernelson were key authors

39:54.460 --> 39:56.780
of the ELA, ELD framework.

39:56.780 --> 39:59.580
And so their contributions are ensuring

39:59.580 --> 40:03.060
that this document is completely aligned

40:03.060 --> 40:04.900
with our existing resource.

40:04.900 --> 40:08.740
And then of course, Dr. Douglas Fisher and Dr. Fry

40:08.740 --> 40:11.700
have currently developed a variety of resources

40:11.700 --> 40:12.780
around distance learning.

40:12.780 --> 40:15.180
So we're very pleased to be able to tap in

40:15.180 --> 40:17.060
to their expertise.

40:17.060 --> 40:19.460
I will be describing later the structure

40:19.460 --> 40:23.220
that we have put in place to develop and gather input

40:23.220 --> 40:26.340
from the distance learning advisory committee.

40:26.340 --> 40:29.900
And we've also put in place an ongoing structure

40:29.900 --> 40:31.420
for stakeholder input.

40:34.540 --> 40:37.660
So at this time, I would like to turn it over

40:37.660 --> 40:41.460
to Richard Culotta, who is the chief executive officer

40:41.460 --> 40:45.900
for the International Society for Technology and Education.

40:46.740 --> 40:48.140
Good morning, Dr. Rota.

40:48.140 --> 40:50.660
Thank you for giving me a minute here

40:50.660 --> 40:53.100
and Superintendent Thurmond, President Darling-Hammond

40:53.100 --> 40:54.260
and all of the board members.

40:54.260 --> 40:57.460
It's a pleasure to join you for a few minutes virtually here.

40:58.540 --> 41:01.340
I just wanted to take a second to share a little bit

41:01.340 --> 41:04.020
about what our role is as ISTE

41:04.020 --> 41:07.580
and also to mention quickly what we do

41:07.580 --> 41:09.940
for those of you who may not be familiar with us.

41:09.940 --> 41:13.340
So we're thrilled to be joining SCOE and Q

41:13.340 --> 41:15.380
and the other great members of this team

41:15.380 --> 41:18.940
to help pull together this guide,

41:18.940 --> 41:23.220
this vision that will both help serve the schools

41:23.220 --> 41:27.980
in California, but also we believe really be a model

41:27.980 --> 41:31.220
for other states to follow as this is exactly the work

41:31.220 --> 41:33.780
that needs to happen at the moment.

41:33.780 --> 41:38.660
So our role in ISTE, what we're doing is really helping

41:38.660 --> 41:42.100
to make sure we're informing all of this work

41:42.100 --> 41:44.380
with solid research, right?

41:44.380 --> 41:45.940
Educational research, what we're learning

41:45.940 --> 41:47.420
from learning sciences and make sure

41:47.420 --> 41:49.980
that it's really grounded in solid principles.

41:49.980 --> 41:53.180
We'll also be working on leading the writing

41:53.180 --> 41:54.860
of the guides, right?

41:54.860 --> 41:56.500
That you'll see.

41:56.500 --> 41:58.580
But one of the parts that I'm most excited about

41:58.580 --> 42:03.580
is the way that Dr. Rota and the team have envisioned this

42:04.780 --> 42:07.980
is really leveraging a variety of experts,

42:07.980 --> 42:12.980
both in California and also nationally, internationally

42:13.380 --> 42:15.220
to really make sure we're getting the best thinking

42:15.220 --> 42:16.540
and best ideas.

42:16.540 --> 42:17.820
And that's part of what we do.

42:17.820 --> 42:19.580
ISTE as an international organization,

42:19.580 --> 42:21.180
we work very closely with all states,

42:21.180 --> 42:23.620
we work very closely with experts in this area.

42:23.620 --> 42:27.100
And so we're pulling together a variety of ideas

42:27.100 --> 42:30.500
and really best practices that we can pull from

42:30.500 --> 42:34.180
to be able to show examples of what these solid research

42:34.180 --> 42:35.820
based practices look like.

42:35.820 --> 42:38.380
We feel it's very important not to just throw out

42:38.380 --> 42:40.260
a bunch of sort of principles,

42:40.260 --> 42:41.980
even if they're really solid principles,

42:41.980 --> 42:44.540
we feel like it's important that they also are accompanied

42:44.540 --> 42:46.420
by tangible practical examples

42:46.420 --> 42:49.180
of what this looks like in practice.

42:49.180 --> 42:50.340
So that's what we'll do.

42:50.340 --> 42:52.620
The last part you see on there, the last two bullets,

42:52.620 --> 42:55.500
we'll work on the design and publishing of the final guide

42:55.500 --> 42:58.580
and developing some digital supplemental content.

42:58.580 --> 43:03.580
This is important because we're making a guide here

43:03.580 --> 43:05.980
that's talking about what the future of learning looks like

43:05.980 --> 43:07.260
and how to leverage technology

43:07.260 --> 43:08.900
and think about things in new and different ways.

43:08.900 --> 43:10.820
And so it's a little awkward

43:10.820 --> 43:13.420
if we talk about all the possibilities

43:13.420 --> 43:18.260
and present a kind of stale looking text document, right?

43:18.260 --> 43:22.020
So what we will do is have, yes, some guides,

43:22.020 --> 43:23.700
but they will be very accessible.

43:23.700 --> 43:25.220
They'll have lots of examples built in

43:25.220 --> 43:27.860
and some digital content, some video examples,

43:27.860 --> 43:30.580
some other things so that it really practices

43:30.580 --> 43:33.860
what we preach a bit here as well.

43:34.700 --> 43:35.900
One final thing that I'll just share

43:35.900 --> 43:38.940
before handing the mic back to Dr. Rota

43:38.940 --> 43:41.060
is that if for those who have not worked with ISTE

43:41.060 --> 43:42.740
or aren't familiar with what we do,

43:42.740 --> 43:45.460
our organization, we're a large nonprofit organization

43:45.460 --> 43:47.900
and our focus is on helping think about

43:47.900 --> 43:51.940
how do we use technology and innovative approaches

43:51.940 --> 43:53.940
to solve tough problems in education.

43:53.940 --> 43:57.260
So we focus a lot on looking at how do we use technology

43:57.260 --> 43:58.420
to close equity gaps.

43:58.420 --> 44:00.420
We internally call it Techquity.

44:00.420 --> 44:03.140
We look at using technology to help make sure teachers

44:03.140 --> 44:06.020
are prepared to really thrive in new environments

44:06.020 --> 44:08.980
to make sure students are prepared for a future world

44:08.980 --> 44:10.460
that looks very different.

44:10.460 --> 44:15.180
And we do that through a whole variety of work streams,

44:15.180 --> 44:17.020
both research that we conduct through partners

44:17.020 --> 44:19.980
like Q and others, but also in providing

44:19.980 --> 44:23.860
and working very closely with teachers and schools

44:23.860 --> 44:26.740
to understand their needs and be able to capture that

44:26.740 --> 44:27.980
in tangible ways.

44:27.980 --> 44:29.860
We do that with a number of districts

44:29.860 --> 44:31.620
across the state of California.

44:31.620 --> 44:33.220
In fact, we have a large event that we do every year.

44:33.220 --> 44:36.220
We bring about 25,000 education innovators together

44:36.220 --> 44:37.940
in person and we were planning on having that

44:37.940 --> 44:41.580
in Anaheim this year, but for reasons that you all know,

44:41.580 --> 44:43.220
that had to be postponed.

44:43.220 --> 44:46.580
So we're very excited to work on this together

44:46.580 --> 44:51.500
with the team and to end with what President Darling Hammond

44:51.500 --> 44:54.020
said, we have an opportunity here.

44:54.020 --> 44:56.020
There's an opportunity to use this moment.

44:56.020 --> 44:58.180
We never would have asked for this COVID moment,

44:58.180 --> 45:01.140
but we got it and the worst thing that we could do

45:01.140 --> 45:04.740
is not take advantage of it in order to really rethink

45:04.740 --> 45:06.500
and reset some of our expectations.

45:06.500 --> 45:09.140
And we are excited to work with SCOE to help create

45:09.140 --> 45:11.620
this guide to do just that.

45:11.620 --> 45:13.260
Back to you, Dr. Arrota, thank you.

45:13.260 --> 45:14.100
Thank you.

45:15.220 --> 45:20.220
So the next slide highlights the important role Q

45:20.580 --> 45:25.140
and it was important to bring Q into this leadership role

45:25.140 --> 45:28.260
because of their extensive experience

45:28.260 --> 45:30.620
working with California educators.

45:30.620 --> 45:35.500
So Q and ISTE are working very closely together

45:35.500 --> 45:38.820
in the development of this resource and what Q has done

45:38.820 --> 45:42.780
thus far is to conduct a survey of California educators

45:42.780 --> 45:47.340
to identify research-based best practices and to begin

45:47.340 --> 45:51.180
to identify high quality interactive resources

45:51.180 --> 45:53.780
that will be embedded throughout this guide.

45:53.780 --> 45:58.260
They are also helping to develop and identify key educators

45:58.260 --> 46:03.020
to include in these vignettes that will help bring life

46:03.020 --> 46:06.340
to the content and document best practices

46:06.340 --> 46:09.340
within the distance learning environment

46:09.340 --> 46:12.460
or a hybrid environment or a classroom setting

46:12.460 --> 46:15.220
using technology as was mentioned.

46:15.220 --> 46:18.660
They are also curating a list of high quality

46:18.660 --> 46:23.660
interactive online materials and will be the key entity

46:23.860 --> 46:26.260
vetting those resources.

46:26.260 --> 46:27.220
Next slide.

46:29.180 --> 46:31.700
As in the initial phase of our work,

46:31.700 --> 46:34.540
we knew that it was important to gather input

46:34.540 --> 46:37.180
from a broad range of stakeholders.

46:37.180 --> 46:40.660
So we began with a letter that was sent on behalf

46:40.660 --> 46:45.180
of state superintendent, Tony Thurman, our board president,

46:45.180 --> 46:49.940
Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond and our county superintendent.

46:49.940 --> 46:52.380
And this letter was sent out back in August

46:52.380 --> 46:55.420
to extend the invitation to be part

46:55.420 --> 46:56.980
of a distance learning coalition.

46:57.020 --> 47:01.780
So the letter was sent to 58 county offices of education,

47:01.780 --> 47:04.100
all districts here in California

47:04.100 --> 47:08.980
and a number of advocacy groups and other organizations.

47:08.980 --> 47:12.100
As you can see, we have the respondents

47:12.100 --> 47:15.140
that include 18 county offices of education,

47:15.140 --> 47:18.380
13 school districts and five advocacy groups,

47:18.380 --> 47:22.220
but do know that we have reached out beyond these respondents

47:22.220 --> 47:25.180
and we have developed a broader coalition

47:25.220 --> 47:27.060
to support this work.

47:27.060 --> 47:32.060
We have and will continue to conduct outreach sessions

47:32.540 --> 47:35.100
to continue to solicit feedback

47:35.100 --> 47:37.420
on the development of this guide.

47:37.420 --> 47:40.420
And the important component of this outreach

47:40.420 --> 47:45.420
is that it includes representation from not only educators,

47:45.820 --> 47:48.900
but parents, other experts,

47:48.900 --> 47:52.220
and we are moving into a process to gather,

47:52.220 --> 47:55.540
conduct empathy interviews with students as well.

47:55.540 --> 47:56.380
Next slide.

47:57.700 --> 47:58.860
So this is the ambitious,

47:58.860 --> 48:01.100
I refer to this as the ambitious timeline

48:01.100 --> 48:04.620
that we have in place to develop this guidance document.

48:04.620 --> 48:08.300
So again, we began in September of 2020

48:08.300 --> 48:10.820
and in the initial part of this work,

48:10.820 --> 48:13.860
we began by gathering initial input

48:13.860 --> 48:16.060
from our advisory committee members

48:17.380 --> 48:20.540
to gather input on the development of the outline

48:20.540 --> 48:24.660
and then we held a subsequent session with our advisory

48:24.660 --> 48:28.220
to review the draft outline that was developed

48:28.220 --> 48:30.900
and we will continue to work with our advisory

48:30.900 --> 48:34.180
to gather input as sections of this document

48:34.180 --> 48:35.340
is being developed.

48:35.340 --> 48:38.940
We are currently working with ISTE, Q

48:38.940 --> 48:41.060
and all of the content writers

48:41.060 --> 48:44.860
in developing this draft guidance document.

48:44.860 --> 48:49.620
And the goal is to present this draft document

48:49.660 --> 48:53.420
at the May state board meeting for final approval.

48:53.420 --> 48:56.740
And then once we've received the feedback at the May meeting,

48:56.740 --> 48:59.860
we will work again very closely with ISTE

48:59.860 --> 49:02.980
and other contributors to develop the final document,

49:02.980 --> 49:06.860
which again, as Richard mentioned, will be an online,

49:06.860 --> 49:10.820
it will be both a PDF as well as an online digital resource

49:10.820 --> 49:15.180
to make it easily accessible and user-friendly for educators.

49:16.980 --> 49:17.820
Next slide.

49:19.860 --> 49:23.340
So I shared with you the stakeholder groups

49:23.340 --> 49:26.260
that were identified to support this project

49:26.260 --> 49:28.780
and from that stakeholder coalition list,

49:28.780 --> 49:33.540
we identified key members to serve on our advisory committee

49:33.540 --> 49:37.020
and the advisory committee, their role is to provide guidance

49:37.020 --> 49:38.700
throughout the course of this project

49:38.700 --> 49:42.500
and provide input in the development of this resource.

49:42.500 --> 49:45.580
They have also begun to help identify

49:45.580 --> 49:49.180
interactive online materials as well as other resources

49:49.740 --> 49:51.260
to support distance learning.

49:51.260 --> 49:54.340
And they are helping to identify examples

49:54.340 --> 49:57.580
of success stories and other illustrative examples

49:57.580 --> 49:59.780
of districts or classroom examples

49:59.780 --> 50:03.460
that we'll be able to incorporate into this guide

50:03.460 --> 50:06.780
as either vignettes or videos.

50:06.780 --> 50:07.620
Next slide.

50:08.620 --> 50:12.660
So this is a broad overview of the committee members

50:12.660 --> 50:16.420
who represent a variety of areas.

50:16.420 --> 50:18.420
We have not only content experts

50:18.420 --> 50:20.060
and I would like to point out

50:20.060 --> 50:22.260
that in the area of content expertise,

50:22.260 --> 50:24.860
we are working with Brian Lindeman,

50:24.860 --> 50:27.660
who is the writing team lead

50:27.660 --> 50:30.260
for the mathematics framework revision work.

50:30.260 --> 50:33.980
We have members of the California subject matter project

50:33.980 --> 50:35.660
serving on our advisory committee

50:35.660 --> 50:37.540
as well as Californians together.

50:37.540 --> 50:40.420
And as you can see, we have representation

50:40.420 --> 50:44.300
from both school districts and county offices of education.

50:45.180 --> 50:49.140
Professional organizations and associations

50:49.140 --> 50:50.940
that serve on our advisory committee

50:50.940 --> 50:55.940
include teacher associations, such as CTA and CFT.

50:55.980 --> 50:57.100
We are also working

50:57.100 --> 51:00.020
with the California parent teachers association,

51:00.020 --> 51:03.180
California charter schools association,

51:03.180 --> 51:05.540
PACE and Ed Trust West.

51:08.460 --> 51:12.660
So moving forward, what we would like to do

51:12.660 --> 51:15.300
is to share with you highlights

51:15.300 --> 51:17.500
of the current draft document

51:17.500 --> 51:20.020
that is currently under development.

51:20.020 --> 51:22.780
Following the forward and the introduction,

51:22.780 --> 51:25.620
there will be three sections.

51:25.620 --> 51:27.500
And the first section will focus

51:27.500 --> 51:31.860
on research-based distance learning guidance,

51:31.860 --> 51:34.620
distance learning principles and practices.

51:34.620 --> 51:36.700
And to develop this section,

51:36.700 --> 51:40.380
ISTE conducted initially a literature review

51:40.380 --> 51:44.100
to identify research-based best practices

51:44.100 --> 51:46.660
for educators and distance learning.

51:46.660 --> 51:49.140
And this formal literature review process

51:49.140 --> 51:52.780
included meta-analysis and systematic reviews

51:52.780 --> 51:56.380
with a particular focus on K-12 distance learning

51:56.380 --> 51:58.900
for online learning.

51:58.900 --> 52:02.620
The part A, the subsection part A

52:02.620 --> 52:05.780
will cover research-based instructional strategies

52:05.780 --> 52:07.340
in online learning.

52:07.340 --> 52:08.380
And in this section,

52:08.380 --> 52:10.860
they will include the national standards

52:10.860 --> 52:13.140
for quality online courses.

52:13.140 --> 52:14.380
There will be a section

52:14.380 --> 52:17.060
focused on incorporating universal design

52:17.060 --> 52:18.580
for learning framework,

52:18.580 --> 52:22.700
as well as other resources to inform this section.

52:22.700 --> 52:27.060
We are also working with Dr. Douglas Frye,

52:27.060 --> 52:29.260
Dr. Douglas Fisher and Nancy Frye

52:29.260 --> 52:32.620
in developing the assessment section.

52:32.620 --> 52:35.380
And this section will provide guidance

52:35.380 --> 52:39.060
in the area of both formative and diagnostic assessment,

52:39.060 --> 52:40.540
and most importantly,

52:40.540 --> 52:44.180
how to analyze and utilize this data

52:44.180 --> 52:46.420
to differentiate instruction.

52:46.420 --> 52:50.260
The section will also include strategies

52:50.260 --> 52:53.700
to accelerate learning, to mitigate learning loss.

52:53.700 --> 52:57.060
And then the final section, part C of section one,

52:57.060 --> 52:59.060
will focus on fostering healthy,

52:59.060 --> 53:01.860
equitable and inclusive digital communities.

53:01.860 --> 53:04.100
And this is the section where the focus

53:04.100 --> 53:06.980
on social-emotional supports for students

53:06.980 --> 53:09.780
will be incorporated that include, again,

53:09.780 --> 53:12.180
many of the resources that have been released

53:12.180 --> 53:14.220
through the California Department of Education

53:14.220 --> 53:18.380
so that we are ensuring that the content in this section

53:18.380 --> 53:21.260
is aligned with other CBE resources.

53:22.220 --> 53:26.940
So at this time, I am going to turn it over to Dr. Bowler,

53:26.940 --> 53:28.900
who again is the lead writer

53:28.900 --> 53:31.780
for the mathematics section, section two.

53:32.780 --> 53:35.700
Good morning, State Board and members of the public.

53:37.220 --> 53:38.220
My name is Jo Bowler.

53:38.220 --> 53:39.940
We're going to talk about maths for a bit.

53:39.940 --> 53:42.980
I'm a professor of mathematics education at Stanford

53:42.980 --> 53:46.060
and co-founder of U-Cubed.

53:46.060 --> 53:48.700
I'm also one of the five writers, as Nancy said,

53:48.700 --> 53:51.220
of the new California maths framework.

53:51.220 --> 53:52.820
So I thought I'd give you an overview

53:52.820 --> 53:54.500
of the approach of that new framework

53:54.500 --> 53:56.540
before we go into this project.

53:56.540 --> 53:59.700
By showing you this visual,

53:59.940 --> 54:02.300
we are emphasising in the new framework

54:02.300 --> 54:03.940
that mathematics work for students

54:03.940 --> 54:08.980
shouldn't be about practising through endless short questions,

54:08.980 --> 54:12.340
but should be about investigating ideas.

54:12.340 --> 54:16.100
And we've also communicated that teachers think about content

54:16.100 --> 54:19.260
not as small disconnected methods,

54:19.260 --> 54:22.860
but as bigger ideas that students can connect

54:22.860 --> 54:24.660
and investigate with.

54:24.660 --> 54:28.260
So we have set out four big content ideas

54:28.300 --> 54:30.700
that you see at the bottom of that document

54:30.700 --> 54:32.820
that apply across all of K-12,

54:32.820 --> 54:36.660
which helps us give a progression through the grades.

54:36.660 --> 54:39.420
So you may be able to see that communicating stories

54:39.420 --> 54:43.300
with data, exploring changing quantities,

54:43.300 --> 54:45.540
taking holes apart and putting parts together,

54:45.540 --> 54:47.860
something we do a lot in mathematics,

54:47.860 --> 54:50.260
and discovering shape and space.

54:50.260 --> 54:51.740
These should always be integrated

54:51.740 --> 54:53.060
with the mathematical practises

54:53.060 --> 54:55.220
that you see on the vertical axis.

54:55.220 --> 54:57.140
And then the cross-cutting themes,

54:57.140 --> 54:59.060
which are new to the framework,

54:59.060 --> 55:01.140
are meant to be encouraging purpose

55:01.140 --> 55:03.180
for students' investigations.

55:03.180 --> 55:06.500
We're saying that maths work should always have a purpose,

55:06.500 --> 55:09.220
whether it's making sense of the world,

55:09.220 --> 55:13.220
predicting what might happen, or impacting the future.

55:13.220 --> 55:18.220
And these ideas apply to all the content and practises.

55:18.300 --> 55:21.020
So that's the background for this work.

55:21.020 --> 55:23.660
And if we can look at the next slide,

55:23.660 --> 55:26.980
we can, myself and Cathy Williams, come to this work

55:27.820 --> 55:30.900
having written a K-8 book series,

55:30.900 --> 55:34.860
and that is organised also around big ideas.

55:34.860 --> 55:37.860
And you see that in that network map.

55:37.860 --> 55:40.460
And as we looked carefully at the standards

55:40.460 --> 55:42.380
to think about ways of making them more manageable

55:42.380 --> 55:44.300
to teachers for this project,

55:44.300 --> 55:47.740
we decided that it wasn't really helpful to cut standards

55:47.740 --> 55:51.260
as nearly all the ideas are needed later on,

55:51.260 --> 55:54.420
but to make them into bigger ideas.

55:54.420 --> 55:57.100
We're organising them under the content connections

55:57.100 --> 55:58.460
of the new framework.

55:58.460 --> 56:01.820
We're integrating them with the ELD framework,

56:01.820 --> 56:04.860
and we plan to make connected maps like these

56:04.860 --> 56:08.940
to show teachers the connected nature of the content.

56:08.940 --> 56:11.620
So the next two slides, and we can look at the next slide,

56:11.620 --> 56:14.180
give you an example from grade three.

56:14.180 --> 56:16.340
If you read the wording of the standards,

56:16.340 --> 56:19.540
you'll see that many of them are very narrow,

56:19.540 --> 56:24.060
which we think leads publishers into making short questions

56:24.060 --> 56:26.460
that target these narrow ideas.

56:26.460 --> 56:30.620
If we just look at that, a little bit of the first one,

56:30.620 --> 56:33.740
represent a fraction one over B on a number line diagram

56:33.740 --> 56:37.060
by defining the interval from zero to one as the whole

56:37.060 --> 56:39.860
and partitioning it into B equal parts,

56:39.860 --> 56:42.540
recognise that each part has size one over B,

56:42.540 --> 56:45.100
and that the end point of the part based at zero

56:45.100 --> 56:47.420
locates the number one over B on the number line.

56:47.420 --> 56:49.980
They're often written in ways that aren't very inspiring

56:49.980 --> 56:51.980
for third grade teachers, we think.

56:52.020 --> 56:55.020
And so we're taking this very detailed content

56:55.020 --> 56:57.500
and we're raising it to a bigger level.

56:57.500 --> 56:59.180
So if we could look at the next slide,

56:59.180 --> 57:01.260
we're saying all of this

57:01.260 --> 57:03.740
could actually be communicated in this way.

57:03.740 --> 57:07.580
Compare unit fractions using different visual models,

57:07.580 --> 57:09.900
including linear models like number lines,

57:09.900 --> 57:13.980
tape measures, and area models, such as shape diagrams,

57:13.980 --> 57:17.460
and encourage student justification with visual models.

57:17.460 --> 57:20.020
We think this is much more meaningful for teachers,

57:21.020 --> 57:24.260
and we see it really as a big step forward

57:24.260 --> 57:27.300
for teachers and students in making maths more meaningful,

57:27.300 --> 57:29.340
not only during this distance learning time,

57:29.340 --> 57:31.820
but going forward into the future.

57:31.820 --> 57:35.780
So just one note about high school before I leave you.

57:35.780 --> 57:37.780
If we look at the next slide,

57:37.780 --> 57:40.500
the high school standards

57:40.500 --> 57:43.700
have a lot of prescribed methods in them

57:43.700 --> 57:45.420
that were really written in the days

57:45.420 --> 57:47.700
before we had good technology.

57:47.900 --> 57:51.380
And this has led to students spending many hours

57:51.380 --> 57:53.060
in algebra, for example,

57:53.060 --> 57:58.060
factoring expressions that nobody will do by hand

57:58.140 --> 57:59.940
when they enter the workplace.

57:59.940 --> 58:01.740
And there's really broad agreement

58:01.740 --> 58:03.620
from people in different sectors

58:03.620 --> 58:06.500
that what's really powerful for high school students

58:06.500 --> 58:10.420
is when they learn to take a problem, set up a model,

58:10.420 --> 58:12.500
use a computer or a calculator

58:12.500 --> 58:14.780
to perform the computational part,

58:14.780 --> 58:17.540
and then make sense of the results.

58:18.380 --> 58:20.820
And we now have wonderful free tools

58:20.820 --> 58:24.100
that innovative teachers are using regularly,

58:24.100 --> 58:26.700
such as Desmas or War from Alpha,

58:26.700 --> 58:29.380
that enable this mathematical power.

58:29.380 --> 58:30.900
So in high school,

58:30.900 --> 58:34.500
we're also recommending the big ideas of the content,

58:34.500 --> 58:37.700
but we're adding that students can do some of the methods

58:37.700 --> 58:41.500
work with technology,

58:41.500 --> 58:43.700
and that will be a better experience for them.

58:43.700 --> 58:47.300
It will also free up time for students and teachers

58:48.260 --> 58:50.740
to do that more important mathematical work.

58:50.740 --> 58:53.180
So we're very carefully recommending technology

58:53.180 --> 58:54.140
that's free.

58:54.140 --> 58:58.180
Most teachers are actually using this technology already.

58:59.580 --> 59:00.780
So one final thought,

59:00.780 --> 59:02.980
it seems that the approach of the two teams,

59:02.980 --> 59:05.220
maths and English are very similar

59:05.220 --> 59:06.780
and compatible with each other.

59:06.780 --> 59:10.500
And I'm now going to turn over to Dr. Halley Yopp,

59:10.500 --> 59:12.540
who will address English language arts.

59:13.820 --> 59:15.500
Thank you very much, Joe,

59:16.460 --> 59:17.700
my colleague, Nancy,

59:17.700 --> 59:20.060
and I are pleased to have this opportunity

59:20.060 --> 59:21.900
to work on the distance learning guidance,

59:21.900 --> 59:25.060
especially on the heels several years ago

59:25.060 --> 59:28.660
of working on the ELA ELD framework.

59:28.660 --> 59:33.660
So I'm sharing here the circles of implementation graphic

59:38.380 --> 59:41.380
that captures the big picture of implementation

59:41.380 --> 59:43.420
of ELA and ELD instruction

59:43.420 --> 59:46.220
as described in that framework.

59:46.220 --> 59:48.740
And in a nutshell, in the outer ring,

59:48.740 --> 59:53.180
you see the overarching goals of ELA ELD instruction.

59:53.180 --> 59:54.540
And those are by the time

59:54.540 --> 59:57.300
California students complete high school,

59:57.300 --> 59:58.940
they have developed the readiness

59:58.940 --> 01:00:01.540
for college careers and civic life,

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:04.940
attained the capacities of literate individuals,

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:07.220
acquired the skills for living and learning

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.580
in the 21st century.

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:11.060
And those include technological competence

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:13.860
as well as global competencies.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:16.140
And they have become broadly literate.

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:21.100
In the center of this graphic are grade level standards,

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:23.620
the year by year pathway

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.540
toward achieving those overarching goals.

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:30.620
And embedded within the ELA slash literacy standards

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:33.100
are the California ELD standards,

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:35.660
which were designed to amplify

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:37.660
areas of English language development

01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:40.380
that are crucial for academic learning.

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:43.540
Circling the standards

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:46.780
are the cross-cutting themes of the standards.

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.580
These themes highlight the interconnections

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:54.580
among reading, writing, listening, speaking and language.

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:58.060
They represent the bigger ideas,

01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:00.420
the cross-cutting themes of the standards.

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:01.820
They're meaning making,

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:04.220
because the course meaning is central

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:07.500
to reading, writing, speaking, listening and language.

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.900
They're language development,

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:11.620
because reading, writing, listening and speaking

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:14.180
are all language processes.

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:16.420
They are also effective expression,

01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:18.180
which I could define at length here,

01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:19.660
but I'm not going to.

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:22.740
Content knowledge and foundational skills.

01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:27.340
These are the five overarching key cross-cutting themes

01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:32.340
of ELA and ELD instruction as conceived in the framework

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:35.860
and duplicated here in this project.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.580
The white field in the graphic

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:41.780
represents the context in which instruction occurs.

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:44.540
We call for instruction that is integrated,

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:48.260
motivating and engaging, respectful

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:49.980
and intellectually challenging

01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:53.620
for all students at all grade levels.

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:56.580
The graphic, particularly those cross-cutting themes

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:59.220
provides the framework and organizing structure

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:03.060
for our discussion of the ELA slash literacy standards.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:06.660
They are the big ideas in the ELA, ELD framework

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:09.020
and they are now the big ideas here

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:11.740
in this distance learning guide.

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:12.740
Next slide, please.

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:18.860
And here we see how this section of the guide is organized.

01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:22.540
There are those five themes.

01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:25.980
There will be a chart for each of those five themes

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:27.740
across the grade levels.

01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:30.660
You see the heading and then below that

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:32.420
are critical standards.

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:34.700
These are clusters of standards

01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.580
or in a few cases, individual standards

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:40.980
that address very closely that theme.

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:44.220
Each theme heading then is followed by several cells

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:47.860
or rows containing critical standards.

01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:49.020
Next slide, please.

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:54.300
Within those cells, you will find

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:58.980
that closely related standards are placed in the same cell.

01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:02.020
You'll find that there are supporting ELD standards

01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:05.300
that are identified and that we include bullets

01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:07.180
and shortly you'll see an example.

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:12.220
Bulleted comments that clarify, contextualize

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:15.340
or emphasize some aspect of the standard

01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:19.540
or clusters of standards and provide instructional guidance

01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:22.820
or that tie in closely with issues of SEL

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:23.980
or issues of equity.

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:28.980
And finally, the ELA standards that are repeated

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:32.540
across themes appear in the same color.

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:36.420
That repetition draws attention to the interrelationship

01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:38.700
among these ideas.

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:39.740
Next slide, please.

01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:44.220
Here we have an example from kindergarten.

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:47.180
This is the chart that displays critical standards

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:50.660
for teaching the language arts as meaning making processes,

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.060
one of those five key themes.

01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:54.940
Now due to space constraints,

01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:58.660
we don't have the actual boxes and borders around these,

01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:02.300
but I'd like you to think about this.

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:06.740
The slide has actually two cells of four

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:08.780
that are in our current draft,

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:12.740
meaning that two of the four clusters of critical standards.

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:13.900
Border lines, as I said,

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.580
have been omitted here due to space constraints,

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:19.340
but you might imagine this as a table with rows

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.380
that we are calling cells.

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:24.060
In the first, you see a green critical standard.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:27.860
The fact that it is green tells us that this same standard

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:31.020
appears in another theme chart for this grade level.

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:33.020
More on that shortly.

01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:37.220
Here the standard is paired with a supporting ELD standard.

01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:40.420
The standards are followed by, in this case, two bullets

01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:44.140
that highlight important instructional considerations,

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:45.900
that is guidance for teachers

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:50.020
as they are thinking about implementation of this standard.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.820
The purple text, remember this color,

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:55.380
is the start of a second cell.

01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:59.180
This purple critical standard is actually three standards

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:01.380
that have been clustered or merged,

01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:04.180
writing standards one, two, and three.

01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:06.500
The ELD standard is provided,

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:08.260
and the bullets highlight the fact

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:11.260
that children use writing to communicate,

01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:15.340
they work to express opinions, information, stories,

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:16.940
use the written language.

01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:20.940
We teach writing as a meaning-making process.

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:25.940
It is not simply printing letters or copying a sentence.

01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:29.660
So with just these two cells in the meaning-making chart,

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:32.740
we see that reading and writing are both thought of,

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:37.140
taught as, and emphasized as meaning-making processes

01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:40.540
here in kindergarten and throughout the grade levels.

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:41.700
Next slide, please.

01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:47.300
This is a different chart within kindergarten.

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:51.060
This attaches to the theme of foundational skills,

01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:54.420
as teachers work to build students' abilities

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:56.740
in the foundational skills.

01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:59.980
On this slide, we see two of the critical standards

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:02.180
in the foundational skills theme.

01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:04.260
The first is in the color brown,

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.820
which signals to us that this same standard

01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:09.340
appears in another one of those five themes

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.060
for this grade level.

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:13.460
The next standard is in purple.

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:15.500
You may recall that the previous slide

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.020
had a purple standard.

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:18.940
It was the same standard,

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:22.740
the cluster of writing standards one through three.

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:26.340
At a glance, teachers can see that the purple standard

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:29.260
is important for supporting understanding

01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:31.620
that writing is a meaning-making process.

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:35.620
Yes, we use it to communicate, as we saw in the last slide,

01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:39.820
and it's crucial for developing foundational skills,

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:43.820
which we see here in the foundational skills theme chart.

01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:46.900
Children are using writing to express ideas,

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:48.660
yes, to share meaning,

01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:52.580
and they also are using their emerging understanding

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:56.420
of the alphabetic principle of foundational skill

01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:59.260
as they work to translate their ideas

01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:01.620
into written language.

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:04.420
The final document includes these charts

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:07.180
of the five themes or big ideas,

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:10.660
clusters of standards at each grade level.

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:12.620
Thank you, and back to Nancy.

01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:26.100
Sorry, Nancy, you're muted.

01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:29.420
Okay, I'm on.

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:33.860
As you heard from both Dr. Bowler and Dr. Yopp,

01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:36.980
the team, they have identified the organization

01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:40.140
and standards that are used in the grade level

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:43.220
and the education and structure of how to identify

01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:46.220
these critical standards organized around these themes

01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:47.620
and these big ideas.

01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:49.900
What I wanted to convey in this slide is that

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:52.940
in these sections, we will also be working

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:56.020
with the ISTE team and with Q

01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:59.380
to infuse social-emotional learning components

01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:00.940
and considerations.

01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:04.380
These are the sections that will also include vignettes

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.940
and other examples, illustrative examples

01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:09.060
from California educators,

01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:12.140
which will also include videos.

01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:16.500
And these are the sections that will include resources,

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:20.140
digital access to high-quality instructional materials.

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:22.300
Next slide.

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:26.700
So the conclusion of this document will focus

01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:30.260
on addressing a vision for the future

01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:32.820
of teaching and learning in the state of California

01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:35.780
and will provide recommendations for leaders

01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:38.180
to move forward with this vision.

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.820
What I do want to emphasize as we close

01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:44.900
is to reiterate what was shared by Shinning Codes,

01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:49.900
which is this is a document that we believe will live

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.020
and is being designed to live

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:54.220
beyond the life of this pandemic.

01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:57.780
It will be a salient and relevant resource,

01:08:57.780 --> 01:09:00.980
whether we are in a distance learning environment,

01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:04.860
in a hybrid environment, or back in the classroom

01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:08.700
where this will be a resource to support teachers

01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:12.140
on the effective use of technology in the classroom.

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:16.860
So again, we appreciate this opportunity as a team

01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:19.940
to provide an update to the state board

01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:23.660
about where we are in the development of this resource.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:26.820
And I, at this time, I will turn it back over

01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:29.220
to President Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond.

01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:34.220
Thank you so much.

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:40.660
I want to open the phone line now for public comment.

01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:44.220
And there we go.

01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:47.580
Members of the public wishing to provide comment

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:51.500
on this item may do so by calling the number on the screen

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:54.660
and entering the access code noted there.

01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:59.300
While we're waiting for the members of the public

01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:01.020
to call in, I will ask board members

01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:03.740
if they want to ask any clarifying questions

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:07.740
of the presenters who've just presented.

01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:11.700
And I will try to be able to watch for your hands.

01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:15.700
If you, I see that member Navo has a hand up.

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:19.420
Thank you.

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:22.100
That was very informative and so exciting

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:24.540
to see the experts in the field

01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:26.220
that are contributing to this work.

01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:29.100
Nancy, I really appreciate the presentation

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:32.740
and the heavy lift that's being done through SCOE.

01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:34.980
One of the questions I do have is you had mentioned

01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:36.820
that there were sections

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:40.220
that addressed vulnerable student groups.

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:42.300
And oftentimes we may hear that

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:45.780
and maybe that section is just a paragraph

01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:46.740
and they call it a section.

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.140
Can you elaborate a little bit more

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:50.580
on what that might look like for ELs,

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:53.500
students with disabilities, vulnerable groups?

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:56.260
Yes, so thank you for the question.

01:10:56.260 --> 01:11:00.340
We are working with not only our county office partners,

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:03.140
but other CDE departments to ensure

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:06.620
that we are developing a comprehensive,

01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:08.980
that we are addressing these areas comprehensively.

01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:13.700
So not only are we specifically including a section

01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:17.500
on strategies to address students with special needs,

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:21.140
we are working with our Californians together.

01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:24.140
We are planning to also work with CABE.

01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:26.380
They're leading other efforts statewide

01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:28.020
to address the needs of English learners

01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:32.060
that include the support for English learners

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:34.060
in a distance learning environment.

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:37.580
We had just yesterday a call with CDE

01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:42.260
to discuss the need to address the importance

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:46.660
of the outreach and the engagement of our foster youth,

01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:49.460
our students experiencing homelessness.

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:51.980
So these are very important conversations

01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:56.220
that we are engaging in with not only our writing team,

01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:59.620
but with our CDE and SBE partners.

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:02.580
Thank you, Nancy, I appreciate that.

01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:06.220
Member Rucker.

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:07.940
Thank you.

01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:10.620
First of all, along with Board Member Novel,

01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:12.820
and I'm sure my other colleagues on the Board,

01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:15.180
I was really gladdened and very excited

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:17.740
to see the work that's being done

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:20.300
and the team that has come together

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:24.460
to put this document and this guidance out.

01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:27.500
I remain concerned, especially given the comments

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:30.340
by our Board President, Dr. Darling-Hammond,

01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:32.620
about the need to pay attention

01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:34.940
to educating the whole child.

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:38.700
There's also a need to make sure that we're focused on

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:42.260
and looking at how to deliver the whole curriculum.

01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:44.660
So I think this guidance is a good start.

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:48.260
To do the work on developing and implementing guidance

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:51.580
and instruction for reading language arts and mathematics

01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:56.580
is very important, but I fear without continuing the work

01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:00.500
to also provide guidance on appropriate good instruction

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:03.700
in science and the other subject areas,

01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:06.420
that it will lead to a continuing emphasis

01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:09.980
that we're already seeing on the subjects that are tested

01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:12.740
or focused on for accountability purposes

01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:15.980
to the detriment of the student experience

01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:18.140
in those other subject areas.

01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:21.380
So I hope that as this guidance goes forward

01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:23.420
and the work continues to develop

01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:25.900
on providing this very excellent tool,

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.700
that there's some consideration on what it means,

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:31.700
not just to provide instructional support

01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:34.340
for the whole child in reading language arts

01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:36.420
and mathematics, but what it means

01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:38.380
to provide instructional support

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:40.140
for the whole curriculum as well.

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:48.740
Does anyone want to respond to that from the group?

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:54.300
I can share that, again, during our call with SBE and CDE

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:57.900
just yesterday or Monday in our planning call,

01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:00.180
we did have discussions about the importance

01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:03.180
of integration across all content areas,

01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:06.540
the exact approach and how we will include this,

01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:08.980
our items that we are in discussion,

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:11.460
but certainly this has been raised

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:13.980
by our writing team as well.

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:17.260
So we will continue to refine our efforts

01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:22.220
and we are very mindful of the importance

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:24.620
of the integration of all content areas.

01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:29.620
So we have a very highly, a team of experts

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.660
and I'm very confident

01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:34.620
that we'll be able to pull this together.

01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:36.460
Thank you very much.

01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:39.740
I am mindful that we're getting into a bit of discussion

01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:41.780
and we still have people queued up

01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:44.660
from the public comment queues.

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:46.740
So I'm gonna ask member Patil Brownson

01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:47.980
if we can come back to you

01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:50.780
after we've heard from the public comment, is that okay?

01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:02.780
Okay, so let's see if there we have any public comment.

01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:04.660
It looks like we have three people signed up

01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:06.180
for public comment.

01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:08.620
I will open the phone lines now.

01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:09.660
Okay.

01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:10.860
Caller, please state your name

01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:12.260
and affiliation for the record.

01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:13.460
Your time starts now.

01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:14.540
You have one minute.

01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:25.620
Jessica Saco, representing Children Now.

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:29.140
I'd like to congratulate Drs. Linda Darling-Hammond

01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:31.660
and I mean Strauss on their reelection

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:34.260
as president and vice president respectively.

01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:35.780
We look forward to continuing our work

01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:37.300
with you in the coming year.

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:38.700
The resources under development

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:39.900
that were presented with this item

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:41.420
are welcome and necessary.

01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:42.740
While many of us have an eye towards

01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:45.660
a return to in-person instruction by September 2021

01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:47.700
when this resource will be available,

01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:49.660
we see the potential of the resource for use

01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:51.380
in case of future emergencies

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:53.340
and with the sharing of lessons learned

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:55.580
during the development and implementation process

01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:56.820
to inform the re-envisioning

01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:58.900
of teaching and learning in California.

01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:01.140
We share member Rucker's call that science, STEM,

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:03.420
history, social science, the arts and other subjects

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:04.940
which have been shown time and time again

01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:06.580
as the essential and core components

01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:10.220
of the 21st century whole child approach to education

01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:11.900
also need to be supported.

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:14.220
These subjects increase student engagement and enthusiasm

01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:16.260
and deepen understanding and mastery of all subjects

01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:19.300
including math, language arts and language development.

01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:20.140
Thank you.

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:20.980
Thank you.

01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:25.420
Caller, please state your name

01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:26.740
and affiliation for the record.

01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:27.940
Your time starts now.

01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:28.980
You have one minute.

01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:36.900
Caller, are you there?

01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:40.260
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:50.980
Hello, it's Eric Premack

01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:53.380
with the Charter Schools Development Center.

01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:54.980
We're very pleased to see that the state

01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:58.140
is starting to think more seriously about these issues

01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:01.460
and we commend Dr. Darling-Hammond for leading on this

01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:02.860
and for the conversation.

01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:05.620
And for leading on this and for the comments she made

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:08.540
during the governor's budget announcement.

01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:11.740
We are though a little disheartened to see

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:14.220
that there's a very narrow focus here.

01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:16.420
And we think that the primary focus

01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:19.700
before you get into the curriculum and instructional issues

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:22.740
is you really need to look at the kind of stultifying mass

01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:26.380
of red tape and the education code that is for decades

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:28.460
been a major barrier to innovation

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:31.780
and instructional methods and makes it very difficult

01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:34.940
for the many schools and many of my member schools

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:36.180
that have been trying to innovate

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:38.020
in these areas for decades.

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:40.700
Many have been able to do so with relative success

01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:44.180
but are definitely have their hands tied behind their backs.

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:47.260
We would urge you to expand the group that's here

01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:51.380
and the focus to primarily or at least initially focus

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:55.180
on the many difficult statutory and regulatory barriers

01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:58.900
to innovation in addition to the important instructional ones

01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:01.180
that the speakers brought up.

01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:02.020
Thank you.

01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:07.900
Good morning, caller.

01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.900
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:10.980
Your time starts now.

01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:12.020
You have one minute.

01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:14.500
Good morning.

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.700
This is Liz Guillen with Public Advocates.

01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:21.780
I'm speaking for the LCFF Equity Coalition as well.

01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:27.740
While we think this is still necessary and important,

01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:30.300
our families and communities

01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:34.100
will have already experienced distance learning as it is

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:37.660
in all its various forms statewide.

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:41.780
This seems late in coming for this particular pandemic

01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:44.460
but we know and it sounds like

01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:46.700
you're going to consider its utility

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:50.100
to study the challenges and lessons learned

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:53.100
as a foundation for future emergencies.

01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:59.300
The board should require

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:01.180
that there be a frank discussion

01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:04.220
of where the distance learning struggle really was

01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:05.580
and continues to be.

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:10.820
Appreciate that there is a focus on math

01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:12.260
and English language arts

01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:17.260
since we see the initial evidence that those big areas

01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:24.020
for focus, old child should also be considered.

01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:24.860
Thank you.

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:25.700
Thank you.

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:28.660
Good morning, caller.

01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:30.620
Would you state your name and affiliation for the record?

01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:31.620
Your time starts now.

01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:32.660
You have one minute.

01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:42.340
Good morning, caller.

01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:43.780
Oh, it looks like we lost her.

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:46.380
That concludes public comment for item number two.

01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:49.740
Thank you very much.

01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:56.100
So getting back to the queue,

01:19:56.300 --> 01:20:00.020
I have member Patio Bronson, member Glover Woods

01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:02.100
and member Strauss.

01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:05.260
So Kim, why don't you get us going?

01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:06.100
Great.

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:06.940
Thank you.

01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:11.060
So I offer gratitude for the approach

01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:13.820
that our panelists offered in terms of thinking

01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:16.140
about the pandemic that we're facing right now

01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:18.780
but also with an eye towards the future

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:23.780
and also reflect that even with the September release date

01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:27.180
there is ongoing possibility

01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:31.500
of a staggered learning structure in the fall

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:36.220
that is not likely to go back to business as usual

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:38.140
with full loading standards,

01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:43.140
especially given that the vaccination schedule

01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:47.700
for young children especially is going to be delayed

01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:50.820
given that there hasn't actually been vaccine trials

01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:52.740
for children under 12.

01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:57.460
So the continued salience of this conversation

01:20:57.460 --> 01:21:01.860
I think will be quite acute still in the fall.

01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:04.940
The question that I had for our panel, however,

01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:07.660
has to do with young children

01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:11.740
and their ability to engage in online learning.

01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:15.260
I think by the governor's budget proposal

01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:19.260
that was released last Friday,

01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:23.420
the emphasis on TK to two and the unique challenges

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:28.020
that young children have with both navigating

01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:31.940
the electronic tools and also just taking up the content

01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:36.340
that is otherwise just a lot of physical activity

01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:39.100
in a physical classroom is something

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:41.980
that is not gonna go away as a challenge.

01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:45.300
And wanted to know first,

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:49.580
how has stakeholder input been influenced

01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:52.700
in terms of are you pulling focus groups?

01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:56.700
How are you outreaching to interact with this segment

01:21:56.700 --> 01:22:00.140
of teachers who teach TK to two

01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:01.780
as well as parents and families

01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:05.420
who can bring this challenge to life?

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:11.500
And then also how it all will recommendations be carved out

01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:15.740
to address the unique challenges of the younger age group.

01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:20.460
I can address the question.

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:24.060
So formally, I'm currently the deputy superintendent

01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:26.940
here at SCOE, but I was also the early learning director

01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:29.180
and led a number of statewide efforts

01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:30.380
focused on early learning.

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:34.780
So here at SCOE, we have a very extensive team

01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:36.340
that works very closely

01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:39.180
with the California Department of Education to develop.

01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:41.740
In fact, we wrote the transitional kindergarten

01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:42.900
implementation guide.

01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:46.700
So we are taking the expertise of our team,

01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:49.860
but recognizing that in this distance learning environment,

01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:52.620
this is a very different environment that we've never faced.

01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:57.460
So we are looking closely at NAEYC recommendations

01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:58.780
that have been released.

01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:01.420
Head Start has developed resources

01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:03.220
and we are working closely

01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:05.740
with the California Department of Education's

01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:09.380
early learning division to ensure the coordination again

01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:12.140
of these resources and the guidance

01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:15.660
that is being developed by CDE

01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:18.580
so that we are integrating all of these resources

01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:21.420
at the national and state level.

01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:24.740
In terms of the outreach, you ask a very good question.

01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:27.620
We do have some representation

01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:29.820
among our early learning colleagues,

01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:33.180
but we know and we have heard

01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:36.260
through these stakeholder input sessions

01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:38.700
that there does need to be additional input.

01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:41.020
So I appreciate your comments

01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:44.660
and we will certainly in our next series

01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:46.420
of stakeholder input sessions

01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:49.380
where we begin to share draft documents,

01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:54.380
we will ensure that we include very specifically

01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:56.980
those representatives from early learning.

01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:06.260
I do wanna, before we move on to others

01:24:06.260 --> 01:24:07.420
with their hands raised,

01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:10.060
we have member Glover Woods and member Strauss.

01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:12.060
I'm looking to see if there's anyone else.

01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:15.060
I just wanna put a little more context on this.

01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:18.460
This project was defined by the legislature

01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:21.380
and a set of requirements that were passed

01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:26.020
in the end of the summer, early fall.

01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:32.380
And so while there is a lot that might be done beyond this,

01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:35.420
the particular parameters of the project were defined

01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:38.260
in that piece of legislation.

01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:40.380
Meanwhile, as you know,

01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:45.380
the governor has proposed supports as it is safe

01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:51.820
for getting the youngest children back in classrooms

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:55.260
as soon as is healthfully and safely possible

01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:59.460
while we're also engaged in this other project,

01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:02.380
which we hope will have to do with as much

01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:06.220
with how technologies may be used in supportive ways

01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:08.740
when we get back to brick and mortar classrooms

01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:11.420
as well as how they may be used in supporting.

01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:14.460
So just to kind of give a framework for the fact that,

01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:16.660
you know, none of these things are in lieu of the other.

01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:21.300
They are all kind of happening simultaneously.

01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:24.180
And I think this resource of identifying

01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:26.540
the critical standards in a way

01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:30.020
that makes them more powerful for teaching

01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:33.020
because they are integrated and teachers can say,

01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:35.380
here's the big idea I'm working on

01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:37.660
rather than trying to find all the little pieces

01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:39.460
sprinkled about the standards

01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:44.460
will be a very big support at all grade levels.

01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:48.540
Even after everything, everyone is back in classrooms.

01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:53.260
Next on the queue I think is a member Glover Woods.

01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:55.980
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond

01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:58.940
and I will probably echo a couple of the comments

01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:01.020
that you have just previously made.

01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:04.260
First and foremost, I would like to say thank you so much

01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:06.580
to Sacramento County Office of Education

01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:08.780
and all the partners that are working with them

01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:11.380
to develop this very important guide.

01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:14.700
And while we do anticipate at some point in time

01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:18.220
that students will be returning for in-person instruction,

01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:21.100
I think it is important for us in that lens

01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:24.500
of reimagining and re-envisioning

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:28.540
what education will look like post the pandemic

01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:31.540
to see how this type of resource

01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:35.940
can really be a companion to in-person instruction

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:37.980
and support student learning

01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:40.380
outside of the brick and mortar classroom.

01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:45.660
Just as I would say a re-emphasis on some areas to look at

01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:48.900
and Dr. Herroda has addressed some of these

01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:52.180
along with the comments from my fellow board members,

01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:56.980
ensuring that embedded and interwoven throughout the guide

01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:02.140
is guidance related to the cultural relevancy

01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:05.900
of pedagogy, strategies and or resources

01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:08.980
that would be very important as well as that integration

01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:11.660
across many curriculum areas

01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:14.620
that we know are so important for student learning.

01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:18.980
One additional piece I would add just for consideration

01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:23.980
is how might we embed support that allow for teachers

01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:27.820
to look at how to utilize the home environment

01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:32.260
and family and community in relation to the big ideas

01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:34.940
that are captured in this guide.

01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:38.140
Just the very nature of distance learning

01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:40.420
lets us know that students would be engaging

01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:42.860
in learning away from the classroom

01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:44.900
and families and community members

01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:49.220
are such a huge support in that particular environment.

01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:52.100
So if there is a way to integrate

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:55.860
what that might look like into the guide,

01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:58.740
I think it could be very beneficial for students.

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:00.260
Thank you.

01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:02.060
Perfect, thank you.

01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:04.300
Member Strauss and then member Fattah.

01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:07.660
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:11.620
So first let me thank Chloe and the entire team

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:14.020
for the coordinated work.

01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:16.900
It's wonderful to see some of our writers

01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:20.340
that help guide our framework development

01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:22.700
connected to this entire project

01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:27.740
and the overall perspective on looking at an entire project

01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:29.620
that will guide the field,

01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:31.820
I think as we look to re-imagining

01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:35.980
and really resetting our whole approach.

01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:37.620
There's a lot of documents out there

01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:39.940
and I know all of our school leaders and teachers

01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:42.900
are working so hard with so many resources.

01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:45.660
So I see this particularly valuable

01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:49.140
as a coordinated document that puts it all together

01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:51.100
and just to support member Rucker's comment

01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:53.980
about integrating all the different curricular areas

01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:55.740
I think is so important.

01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:58.940
So we've learned a lot along the way of developing

01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:02.180
that you can be teaching literacy through science.

01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:05.580
We know that a lot of our, there are a lot of areas,

01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:08.140
but I just think people are doing the very best they can

01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:11.020
and this creates a really wonderful opportunity,

01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:13.660
particularly as the Deputy Superintendent said,

01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:16.220
they're looking at vignettes and videos

01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:18.500
and I think we found through the frameworks

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:20.780
that those vignettes are actually quite helpful

01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:23.940
in illustrating actually how some of these documents

01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:26.460
come to life in a classroom.

01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:29.180
And what I think about as we move forward on this

01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:32.980
is that this is likely to be ready this fall

01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:36.100
and that we ought to be really connecting

01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:39.700
with say teacher education as we prepare future educators

01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:42.500
to have a guidance document to make sense

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:44.500
of all the resources out there.

01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:46.980
This is sort of an overarching document

01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:49.060
and then obviously through our county offices

01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:52.100
and our curriculum divisions helping to look,

01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:54.900
because we know from the time that we developed frameworks

01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:56.660
and guidance documents,

01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:59.500
it's years till it's fully implemented

01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:02.340
and people often depend on what they have

01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:04.020
because they're driving the train

01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:06.060
as they're looking at new materials.

01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:08.460
So I think we ought to think thoughtfully

01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:11.980
about implementation with the professional development money

01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:13.420
in the governor's budget,

01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:16.660
how we might look to training and support for teachers

01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:18.100
to learn some of these materials,

01:30:18.100 --> 01:30:20.900
but overall just a tremendous amount of support

01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:23.940
to Superintendent Gordon and the entire team

01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:26.420
for a coordinated visionary document

01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:28.260
that has the pieces connected

01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:29.940
and to all the wonderful writers

01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:31.700
that are willing to stay with the process

01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:34.300
and connect the work I can think with,

01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:36.580
all the ELA, ELD work that we did

01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:38.500
and I'm still talking to districts

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:40.300
who don't quite remember some of the things

01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:41.740
that are in that document.

01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:44.140
And so I see a potential down the line

01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:46.420
of using this as a training document

01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:48.860
for a pre-service and teachers in service

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.620
in different stages of their career.

01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:53.420
This would be a wonderful overall guidance document.

01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:54.980
Thank you very much.

01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:56.260
Thank you.

01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:57.940
I think that says it well.

01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:01.260
Member Fatah and then member Rodriguez.

01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:03.860
Thank you, President Darling-Cammond

01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:06.260
and I just like to share the gratitude

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:09.740
that my colleagues have all shared on the board

01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:12.660
regarding the amazing work that you guys have been doing

01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:15.700
in tandem with following SB 98.

01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:19.860
And I really, I liked a component that you touched on.

01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:21.820
You mentioned how there have been so far

01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:23.860
18 counties of education have responded,

01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:26.100
13 districts, five advocacy groups

01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:27.740
and how you guys were kind of moving

01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:30.620
in a direction of looking at empathy interviews

01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:31.620
with the students.

01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:34.180
And I really think that it's incredibly important

01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:35.900
for us to be listening to students.

01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:37.860
I think that the student voice is incredibly important

01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:40.660
amidst this pandemic and informing

01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:41.740
the curriculum development.

01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:44.700
And so I'd encourage you to really listen

01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:46.980
to the student voices when it comes to these issues

01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:49.420
and when it comes to the perspective that they have

01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:50.980
regarding the curriculum development

01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:53.500
and to try as best as possible

01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:55.660
to not tokenize their voices.

01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:58.620
Terrific, thank you.

01:31:58.620 --> 01:31:59.780
Member Rodriguez.

01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:02.340
Thank you.

01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:05.860
And I just wanna echo everything that's already been said

01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:10.180
from integrating and not leaving out important subjects

01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:11.740
is the arts.

01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:17.220
I like the way the ELD themes were incorporated in this.

01:32:17.220 --> 01:32:22.220
And I think that that would be a very natural application

01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:26.220
to go into the integration, to use those themes.

01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:30.900
And also what Member Fatah just said,

01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:34.220
I would really like to get students' perspective

01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:39.220
and teachers' perspective on how this would land with us.

01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:45.060
And finally, I wanna make sure that we don't sacrifice

01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:51.180
depth for shiny technology,

01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:53.260
because I think that sometimes we can get so caught up

01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:55.460
in the apps and in this and in that,

01:32:55.460 --> 01:33:00.460
that going deep into especially things like civics

01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:04.380
and things that we really need to develop

01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:07.980
deep understanding and deeper learning for our students

01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:11.060
that it doesn't get lost in the technology.

01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:13.460
So I just really want to point that out.

01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:16.340
And thank you so much for your excellent thought

01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:18.660
and the incredible team that was brought together

01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:20.700
to start this work.

01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:26.300
And I think that says it well.

01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:28.140
Member Patia Brunson, your hand is still up,

01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:32.060
but I'm assuming that that was maybe leftover from before.

01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:34.580
Okay, so that concludes our discussion.

01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:36.380
And I wanna add my thanks.

01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:38.300
This is really an all-star team

01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:39.900
that has been working on this

01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:43.100
with a very coherent big vision.

01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:46.820
Thanks to Dave Gordon and Nancy Giroda

01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:51.820
at the county office for just amazing work on this.

01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:54.820
And then all of the members of the writing team,

01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:58.140
Joe Bowler and Hallie Yopp are bringing that coherence

01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:01.380
from the frameworks that they have worked on,

01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:04.140
which is really going to help this become

01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:06.100
a very useful tool for us.

01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:09.140
And I just want to thank all of the members of the team

01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:10.980
and all of the other members of the team.

01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:14.460
Really very, very grateful for this work.

01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:18.340
And with that, we will conclude this information item.

01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:21.940
Thank you, Shanine and everyone else who presented.

01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:25.900
And given that we have a long assessment item coming up,

01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:28.740
I think we should take our 10-minute break now.

01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:33.740
So you'll be ready to engage fully in the next discussion.

01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:36.900
We should be back by 10-18.

01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:40.660
I think we need to mute ourselves.

01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:45.420
I think you, let's see,

01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:49.060
you have to turn off your microphone and your camera,

01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:52.660
and then we'll turn the cameras back on when we come back.

01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:53.860
See you at 10-18.

01:34:56.820 --> 01:35:00.220
All right, so I'm gonna ask Brooks to call the roll

01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:01.740
to reestablish a quorum.

01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:05.500
Member Sun.

01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:11.060
Vice President Strauss.

01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:12.220
Here.

01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:13.060
Member Rucker.

01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:15.260
Here.

01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:16.340
Member Rodriguez.

01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:19.180
Here.

01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:20.460
Member Patil Brownson.

01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:22.740
Here.

01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:24.380
Member Navo.

01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:25.580
Here.

01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:26.580
Member McQuillin.

01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:28.940
Here.

01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:30.060
Member Glover Woods.

01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:32.460
Here.

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:33.300
Member Fatah.

01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:35.260
Here.

01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:37.180
President Darling-Hammond.

01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:38.020
Here.

01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:38.860
Member Burr.

01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:45.900
Here.

01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:49.740
Great.

01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:51.700
We have a quorum.

01:35:53.980 --> 01:35:57.020
I'm gonna start then on agenda item three,

01:35:57.020 --> 01:35:58.700
which is the California assessment

01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:01.900
of student performance and progress system

01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:03.980
and the English language proficiency assessments

01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:05.060
for California.

01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:09.420
We're going to be listening to the request for approval

01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:11.220
of proposed goals and priorities

01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:14.260
to be included in the California assessment system

01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:17.540
request for qualifications, stage three,

01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:20.020
which is the formal written submission

01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:22.900
and an update of program activities.

01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:26.780
And the item will be presented by Mal Vang of the CDE.

01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:28.100
Mal, please begin.

01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:30.420
Thank you.

01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:31.500
Good morning.

01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:34.060
I'm Superintendent Thurmond, President Darling-Hammond

01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:35.980
and board members.

01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:37.420
As mentioned, I'm Mal Vang.

01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:39.740
I'm the director for the assessment development

01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:41.100
and administration division

01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:43.580
at the California Department of Education.

01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:46.740
The item before you today is an action item

01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:48.180
and an information item.

01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:51.540
Alex, it's not scrolling.

01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:52.380
Okay.

01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:53.220
Excuse me.

01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:54.060
Thank you.

01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:57.660
The presentation will include the following topics.

01:36:57.660 --> 01:37:01.420
We will begin with an introduction by Rachel Maves,

01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:04.300
who is our deputy superintendent

01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:06.700
of the instruction and measurement branch

01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:09.340
and an overview of the program.

01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:11.860
And then we'll move on to the next item,

01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:13.300
which is the final item,

01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:14.700
which is the final item,

01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:16.100
which is the final item,

01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:17.380
the instruction and measurement branch

01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:21.060
and an overview of the California Department of Education's

01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:23.580
recommendation for approval.

01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:27.180
We'll visit the LPAC Fall Administration Reflections

01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:30.700
and then go over the 2020-2021 timelines,

01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:33.940
test administration options and considerations.

01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:36.140
And then we'll end with the CASP update

01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:37.500
or the California assessment

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.780
for Student Performance and Progress updates.

01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:43.140
And I will stop talking here

01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:48.140
and introduce Rachel to begin.

01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:51.580
Thank you, Dr. Vang.

01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:54.100
Hello everyone, I'm President Darlene Hammond,

01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:57.400
Vice President Strauss and State Board members.

01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:00.740
As we come before you with this item on assessments,

01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:03.540
I would like to once again situate our discussion

01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:05.540
in the current context.

01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:07.980
At our last meeting, as we requested approval

01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:11.500
for a reduced blueprint to the ELA and math assessments,

01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:14.180
I noted there were many unknowns.

01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:17.060
We were uncertain what COVID cases would look like

01:38:17.060 --> 01:38:19.180
as the testing window opened.

01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:21.380
We were uncertain how many districts

01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:24.060
would be able to move forward with bringing students back

01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:26.340
to in-person instruction this month,

01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:29.140
and how many would remain in distance learning.

01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:31.420
And while all those answers are clear now,

01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:34.860
yesterday the Sacramento region moved into the purple tier,

01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:37.780
allowing once again a slow reopen.

01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:42.420
Each day, each week brings a new set of circumstances

01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:45.980
that require adjustment and flexibility,

01:38:45.980 --> 01:38:48.660
and it is admittedly exhausting.

01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:53.780
There is nothing about our current situation that is easy.

01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:57.380
Transitioning 6.2 million students to distance learning

01:38:57.380 --> 01:39:00.700
in a matter of months has not been easy.

01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:02.820
Moving instruction to a virtual setting

01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:05.660
while simultaneously building staff capacity

01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:07.860
around new instructional strategies

01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:11.420
in what for many has been a foreign technological world

01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:13.460
has not been easy.

01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:16.580
Trying to engage students through a computer screen

01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:18.140
instead of in your classroom

01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:20.420
where you can get down on their level,

01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:24.020
look them in the eye and express your care and concern

01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:26.980
has not been easy.

01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:30.460
Planning for in-person instruction, then hybrid,

01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:33.780
then distance learning, then hybrid again,

01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:35.380
has not been easy.

01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:37.740
And juggling the pressure of full-time jobs

01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:41.100
with kids at home has not been easy.

01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:43.500
None of this is easy.

01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:46.340
And yet we continue one foot in front of the other

01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:50.660
because at the heart of all of this chaos are our children.

01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:53.500
Over the last few months,

01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:56.540
CDE has explored various options

01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:59.900
to try to ease some of the burden felt by districts

01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:03.340
while still meeting federal and state requirements,

01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:06.980
which as I continue to learn, again, is not easy.

01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:09.980
At the November board meeting,

01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:12.020
we proposed an adjusted blueprint

01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:15.020
that would shorten the ELA and math test.

01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:16.980
Over the course of the last few months,

01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:20.660
we have worked tirelessly with stakeholders, contractors,

01:40:20.660 --> 01:40:23.780
and various LEA staff across the state

01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:26.940
to provide multiple options for test administration

01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:30.380
that address the safety of our staff and students.

01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:32.500
Today and a later item,

01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:34.460
we will take the first step

01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:37.060
to decouple accountability from assessments

01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:41.060
by participating in a streamlined waiver offered by ED,

01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:43.700
which pushes the identification of CSI schools

01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:44.980
out in additional years.

01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:49.020
And clearly, we still have more work to do.

01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:52.780
As federal and state requirements allow,

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:55.260
we are committed to finding solutions

01:40:55.260 --> 01:40:57.420
that provide relief and support

01:40:57.420 --> 01:40:59.620
to our partners in this field.

01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:02.740
It is my hope that as we continue to navigate a year

01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:07.220
that relentlessly tests our strength and fortitude,

01:41:07.220 --> 01:41:12.220
we model collaboration, partnership, innovation, and unity.

01:41:13.460 --> 01:41:16.460
And with that, I will turn this item back over to Dr. Boehme.

01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:27.620
Thank you, Rachel.

01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:31.460
Thank you.

01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:32.300
Thank you.

01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:00.900
So today, the California Department of Education

01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:04.540
is seeking approval on the proposed goals and priorities

01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:06.980
to be included in the written submission

01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:11.980
from potential contractors for our next assessment contract.

01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:17.980
I will go over the proposed goals and priorities

01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:21.220
and background on our procurement process.

01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:24.540
And we are in stage three.

01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:27.860
So this first topic here, again,

01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:32.780
will cover the proposed goals and priorities.

01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:36.500
Just to give some background,

01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:40.460
this slide provides or displays all the assessments

01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:42.940
in our California assessment system,

01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:45.300
which includes both the California Assessment

01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:49.100
of Student Performance and Progress, or CAST,

01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:51.740
and the English Language Proficiency Assessments

01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:53.460
for California, or LPAC.

01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:57.940
Under the requirements of the Every Student Succeeds Act,

01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:01.660
or ESSA, enacted on December 10th, 2015,

01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:03.380
which reauthorized the Elementary

01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:07.060
and Secondary Education Act of 1965,

01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:10.460
all states accepting title funds for use

01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:12.100
by local educational agencies

01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:17.100
must assess all eligible students on these assessments.

01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:18.940
So on one side, we have the CAST,

01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:21.020
which consists of our English Language Arts,

01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:23.260
Mathematics, and Science tests.

01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:26.740
Our alternate assessments for English Language Arts,

01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:29.780
Mathematics, and Science, and the primary language,

01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:31.940
which is assessment, which we have

01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:35.020
the California Spanish Assessment, or CSA.

01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:38.420
On the other side, we have the LPAC,

01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:42.740
which consists of the initial LPAC, the summative LPAC,

01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:45.540
and both the initial and summative alternate LPAC.

01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:48.620
So the CAST and LPAC contracts

01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:53.620
were competitively procured separately in 2015.

01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:55.340
And at that time, the CAST contract

01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:58.140
encompassed the technology infrastructure.

01:43:58.140 --> 01:44:00.900
Then in 2018, the LPAC was integrated

01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:03.260
into the CAST contract, which included

01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:05.460
the development and administration

01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:07.220
of both the CAST and the LPAC

01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:11.020
through the 2021-2022 school year.

01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:13.020
So the current contract will expand

01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:14.060
at the end of the school year.

01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:15.900
So the current contract will expire

01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:19.300
at the end of December 2022.

01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:24.060
The next contract is projected to begin on July 1, 2022.

01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:28.060
The California Department of Education has implemented,

01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:29.980
or is in the process of implementing

01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:33.860
a four-stage request for qualification procurement process.

01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:36.460
And the goals of this process is to,

01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:39.740
one of the goals is to identify an assessment contractor

01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:41.500
with the capacity and expertise

01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:45.220
to successfully implement the California assessment system.

01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:48.340
And the process is competitive and open,

01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:50.860
utilizing standardized scoring criteria

01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:54.340
in an effort to determine whether potential contractors

01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:56.940
are qualified to provide the critical components

01:44:56.940 --> 01:44:58.940
of our assessment programs.

01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:03.100
So the four stages include qualifications,

01:45:03.100 --> 01:45:05.340
the mandatory demonstrations,

01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:09.060
the formal written submission, and negotiations.

01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:11.940
So the two contractors or potential contractors

01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:14.860
that passed stage one in June 2020

01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:17.780
and stage two in November 2020

01:45:17.780 --> 01:45:21.380
are Educational Testing Service, or ETS,

01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:25.820
and National Computer Systems, or NCS Pearson, Incorporated.

01:45:29.260 --> 01:45:32.260
The goals, the proposed goals and priorities

01:45:32.260 --> 01:45:35.060
to be included in stage three are

01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:37.140
enhance the development and administration

01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:38.660
of high quality assessments

01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:41.500
of the California assessment system

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:44.860
through the 2020-2027 school years.

01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:49.620
Examples of assessments to include

01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:54.380
are all the summative, interim, and formative assessments.

01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:56.900
And continue to improve the assessment system

01:45:56.900 --> 01:46:01.500
to ensure efficient, effective, and accurate results

01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:05.220
with enhancements to support multiple administration modes,

01:46:05.220 --> 01:46:08.300
explore and advance technology solutions

01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:11.460
that meet system capacity, performance, and usability

01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:13.940
to the greatest extent possible.

01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:17.260
I will recap the recommendation

01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:19.140
and proposed goals and priorities

01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:21.140
toward the end of this presentation

01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:23.060
while I cover program updates.

01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:30.500
California, in the fall,

01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:32.940
well, for preparation for this school year,

01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:35.460
California has been working to prepare

01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:38.020
for all the administration of assessments.

01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:40.540
But given the uncertainty of local conditions

01:46:40.540 --> 01:46:42.500
as a result of the pandemic,

01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:44.500
we know that administering assessments

01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:46.500
has been challenging as we reflect

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:49.140
on the fall administrations of the ALPAC.

01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:56.580
So the 2020-21 State Wives Testing Plan

01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:59.380
was to begin with the initial ALPAC on July 1

01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:01.220
with a paper pencil version

01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:03.700
and transition to the computer-based version

01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:05.220
starting on August 20,

01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:09.620
at which time the paper-based version would be discontinued.

01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:14.020
The initial ALPAC is used to determine, just to recap,

01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:15.500
it is used to determine

01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:18.140
the English language proficiency of students

01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:20.300
whose home language survey indicates a language

01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:21.580
other than English

01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:24.740
and entering California public schools for the first time

01:47:25.900 --> 01:47:29.180
so that we can get the students the help

01:47:29.180 --> 01:47:30.300
in learning English

01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:33.100
and support that they may need in school.

01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:37.060
However, due to the impact and challenges of the pandemic,

01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:41.820
we continue to provide both options of paper pencil

01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:45.540
and computer-based for the duration of this year.

01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:46.740
So as you know,

01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:50.140
all summative testing was suspended last spring

01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:52.460
and based on guidance from the federal government

01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:55.740
to states in early May 2020,

01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:59.940
it allowed states to extend their

01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:03.140
spring English language proficiency assessments

01:48:03.140 --> 01:48:04.700
through the fall

01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:09.700
and our legislature approved trailer bill language

01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:13.420
section 103 of Senate Bill 98,

01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:18.420
which did extend the 2019-2020 summative ALPAC testing window

01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:24.420
from August 20 through October 30, 2020.

01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:28.340
In addition, LEAs were greatly concerned about the,

01:48:28.340 --> 01:48:31.780
or local educational agencies for LEAs,

01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:34.060
were greatly concerned about the inability

01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:36.300
to administer the summative ALPAC,

01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:38.740
which provides results to determine those students

01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:42.020
who met English language proficiency requirement

01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:45.060
of the reclassification criteria.

01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:46.340
So in this case,

01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:49.740
students who would have potentially reclassified

01:48:49.740 --> 01:48:51.660
would have to wait another year

01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:54.820
to take the summative ALPAC in spring 2021.

01:48:55.980 --> 01:48:59.820
So although the window was extended by the legislation,

01:48:59.820 --> 01:49:04.820
LEAs were unable to open doors for in-person instruction

01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:07.660
due to the COVID restrictions,

01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:09.620
and therefore the CDE identifies

01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:11.900
several test administration options,

01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:15.300
including in-person and remote for both initial

01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:19.100
and the optional summative ALPAC fall administrations,

01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:22.580
since most were completed in the fall.

01:49:25.420 --> 01:49:28.980
So through our efforts in the fall,

01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:32.180
some lessons were learned, and I will cover that.

01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:34.380
Lessons learned from test administration,

01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:36.300
from the test administration options

01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:38.980
is that providing flexibility and options

01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:40.860
in a timely manner is essential.

01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:45.500
The CDE and our contractor, ETS,

01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:48.500
has worked quickly to determine feasible

01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:49.980
test administration options

01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:52.860
and develop physically distancing guidelines

01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:56.060
for local educational agencies to use.

01:49:56.060 --> 01:49:58.700
These test administration options, as I mentioned,

01:49:58.700 --> 01:50:03.020
are in-person co-located with the suggested guidelines

01:50:03.020 --> 01:50:06.300
for physically distancing test administrations.

01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:07.460
The second option was

01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:09.820
remote computer-based test administration,

01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:13.060
which provided the test examiner and students

01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:16.260
secure access to the test session

01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:18.300
through their own digital devices.

01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:20.780
The third option was remote paper pencil,

01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:23.820
which required the local educational agency

01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:26.060
to securely mail the paper pencil test

01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:28.660
to the student's home with clear directions

01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:31.260
that it should be open, should not be open

01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:32.860
until the student is connected

01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:34.700
with the test examiner by video.

01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:41.580
Another set of lessons learned came from the guidance

01:50:41.580 --> 01:50:44.420
and resources that were developed.

01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:47.580
Along with these, the guidelines,

01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:49.620
many more resources were developed

01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:54.180
to provide LEAs additional guidance.

01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:58.660
And this included detailed instructions

01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:00.500
for how to administer the LPAC

01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:04.020
in each of the three test administration options.

01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:07.580
There was a parent acknowledgement form for remote testing

01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:11.340
which outlined what parents can do

01:51:11.340 --> 01:51:13.660
to support remote testing at home

01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:15.980
and what they cannot do to ensure the security

01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:18.340
and validity of the assessment.

01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:20.900
However, the requirement of a signature

01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:25.180
or approval through an electronic means like a survey

01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:28.620
was difficult to secure for the acknowledgement

01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:30.020
from parents and guardians,

01:51:30.020 --> 01:51:32.980
and it really did delay testing in some cases.

01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:37.220
So there are guides for test examiners,

01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:40.500
videos for administering the domains,

01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:43.020
and detailed technology requirements

01:51:43.980 --> 01:51:46.780
for a successful administration.

01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:51.780
And all of these materials are posted on the LPAC website

01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:53.820
which is the LPAC.org.

01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:59.420
Additional lessons learned revolved

01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:00.860
around training and support.

01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:05.940
Virtual training for local educational agencies

01:52:05.940 --> 01:52:10.140
such as LPAC coordinators or their designated trainer

01:52:10.140 --> 01:52:14.020
was provided through the Moodle training site.

01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:16.980
And regional county offices also supported

01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:21.820
local educational agencies in various ways.

01:52:21.820 --> 01:52:25.500
In addition, the Educational Testing Service

01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:28.660
hosted virtual question and answer sessions

01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:33.660
that provided participants an opportunity to ask questions

01:52:33.660 --> 01:52:38.660
and receive answers live as well as a technology webcast

01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:42.780
that provided information about a variety of topics

01:52:42.780 --> 01:52:46.060
associated with the remote testing sessions and options.

01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:52.020
So in our preliminary analysis in December,

01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:55.460
it indicated that the summative LPAC

01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:58.100
or the optional summative LPAC that we administer

01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:03.100
in the fall was administered to 40,767 students.

01:53:03.180 --> 01:53:06.940
There are still some paper tests being received

01:53:06.940 --> 01:53:11.540
by our contractor and that number may change in the future,

01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:13.900
but I think that we're wrapping that one up.

01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:16.260
So this administration,

01:53:16.260 --> 01:53:18.540
along with the test administration options

01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:20.500
that were also made available

01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:23.740
to local educational agencies on August 20

01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:26.780
for the initial LPAC resulted

01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:29.740
in the California Department of Education

01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:32.060
and the Contractor Educational Testing Service

01:53:32.060 --> 01:53:34.420
gathering information on improvements

01:53:34.420 --> 01:53:37.540
that could be made to the test administration guidelines

01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:41.900
in preparation for all the summative testing in spring 2021.

01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:53.820
Another lesson learned was regarding

01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:58.380
the test administration itself or preparation for it.

01:53:58.380 --> 01:54:00.820
Test examiners were reluctant to sign

01:54:00.820 --> 01:54:04.620
the test security affidavit for remote administration

01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:06.860
due to fear of being held accountable

01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:10.020
for anything that happens in the students' homes.

01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:14.620
So we need to implement some changes there.

01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:18.620
And for students, one of the things

01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:21.340
is during test administration for group session,

01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:23.900
four students per remote group test session

01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:28.260
was not sufficient and the test delivery system

01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:30.300
should be configured to increase

01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:32.940
the number per session for spring.

01:54:32.940 --> 01:54:35.420
And also coordinating the delivery

01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:39.100
of secure K-2 student writing answer books

01:54:39.100 --> 01:54:41.180
for remote administration was difficult

01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:43.060
and not cost effective,

01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:45.900
so we need to provide additional options

01:54:45.900 --> 01:54:49.140
to be more efficient and supportive of the field.

01:54:51.660 --> 01:54:52.660
As a result of that,

01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:56.020
there was an improvement made for LPAC specifically,

01:54:56.020 --> 01:54:58.580
and that is we can make revisions

01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:01.100
to the directions for test examiners

01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:05.860
to transcribe the K-2 student writing responses

01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:07.500
during remote administration

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:09.580
to support the coordination of materials

01:55:09.580 --> 01:55:11.460
and reduce LEA costs.

01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:18.780
Another improvement for,

01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:22.420
or other improvements that will benefit

01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:24.100
both LPAC and CAS

01:55:25.100 --> 01:55:28.820
are to provide guidance on the test security affidavit

01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:31.420
and updated directions for test examiners

01:55:31.420 --> 01:55:34.980
in our test administration manuals.

01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:39.100
Regarding lessons learned for training,

01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:43.460
we've streamlined the content of our online training modules

01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:45.740
to provide comprehensive and efficient

01:55:46.820 --> 01:55:50.100
remote test administration training resources for educators

01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:54.260
in the distance learning context based on feedback

01:55:54.260 --> 01:55:57.140
that we've collected from educators.

01:55:57.140 --> 01:55:59.540
Training videos have been created

01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:01.940
to enhance online training content,

01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:04.140
and educators are now able to practice

01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:05.500
remote test administration

01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:07.820
by administering the practice tests

01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:10.460
using the new secure browser remotely.

01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:15.140
Although there are no limit to the number of students

01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:19.500
who can be part of a remote testing session,

01:56:19.540 --> 01:56:23.340
the CDE and ETS is recommending testing

01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:26.460
a maximum of 20 students per session

01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:28.220
to ensure test security,

01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:30.860
and this would enable our test examiners

01:56:30.860 --> 01:56:35.460
and test administrators to manage the remote session,

01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:36.500
monitor students,

01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:38.740
and address any questions that might arise.

01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:48.580
Now, some of the key lessons learned

01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:55.500
did also help us learn that the parents

01:56:55.540 --> 01:56:57.220
have many questions and concerns

01:56:57.220 --> 01:57:00.180
regarding remote administration option.

01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:02.740
So to assist and support parents,

01:57:02.740 --> 01:57:07.140
a website has been created to help parents

01:57:07.140 --> 01:57:11.460
and guardians stay informed about remote testing.

01:57:11.460 --> 01:57:15.020
The website includes video tutorials and other resources

01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:18.100
to help parents understand the remote testing procedures

01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:22.060
and to highlight the importance of spring administrations.

01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:26.980
Furthermore, the parent consent acknowledgement form

01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:29.180
has been replaced with a parent remote testing

01:57:29.180 --> 01:57:33.620
informational letter to streamline the process

01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:37.380
of notifying parents or guardians for remote testing

01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:39.700
where a signature is not required

01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:42.780
by providing a contact for parents and guardians

01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:46.140
to reach out to if their child cannot participate

01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:47.900
through remote administration

01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:52.300
since many did encounter some challenges

01:57:52.300 --> 01:57:55.740
with that process during the fall administration,

01:57:55.740 --> 01:57:57.740
which can cause delays in testing.

01:58:00.940 --> 01:58:05.940
So we are planning some additional support for spring

01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:11.020
by offering a series of office hours

01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:15.740
in later in January and February,

01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:18.740
and the coffee sessions to provide ongoing support

01:58:18.740 --> 01:58:22.540
and allow for local educational agency staff

01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:24.780
to ask questions and answers.

01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:32.620
So in terms of preparing for the spring administrations,

01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:39.900
next I will go over the 2020, 2021 testing timelines,

01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:43.420
test administration options and considerations for spring.

01:58:46.260 --> 01:58:51.260
So this slide provides the initial

01:58:52.260 --> 01:58:55.260
and summative assessments timelines.

01:58:55.260 --> 01:58:58.660
The statewide testing windows are how we typically,

01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:02.260
typically launch our assessment programs.

01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:04.380
One change this year is the CASP,

01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:06.220
a Smarter Balanced summative assessments

01:59:06.220 --> 01:59:09.140
for English language arts and mathematics

01:59:09.140 --> 01:59:14.140
in order to change to the adjusted blueprints

01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:15.940
approved by the State Board of Education

01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:17.780
during the November meeting.

01:59:19.020 --> 01:59:22.460
These assessments will not launch until February 22nd.

01:59:23.460 --> 01:59:26.940
As provided in this table, our assessment operates,

01:59:26.940 --> 01:59:29.620
our assessment system really operates year round

01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:31.740
with minimal down times.

01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:35.460
Local educational agencies do select

01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:38.420
their own testing window within the available test,

01:59:38.420 --> 01:59:41.380
statewide testing window based on their instructional year

01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:43.860
or what has been determined.

01:59:45.140 --> 01:59:50.140
So all California, also although we understand

01:59:51.500 --> 01:59:54.220
that although California has been preparing, adjusting

01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:56.860
and learning how to administer assessments

01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:59.900
during this pandemic, we know that there are

01:59:59.900 --> 02:00:02.300
varying circumstances around the state

02:00:02.300 --> 02:00:04.340
and for some it will be very difficult

02:00:04.340 --> 02:00:07.700
to administer assessments if it is not safe

02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:09.180
to do so in person.

02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:19.620
So since September, the U.S. Department of Education

02:00:19.820 --> 02:00:22.220
has indicated that it will not approve

02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:26.220
statewide assessment waivers for the 2021 school year.

02:00:29.780 --> 02:00:32.780
So the CDE has been working to provide

02:00:32.780 --> 02:00:35.580
test administration options that allow

02:00:35.580 --> 02:00:37.980
local educational agencies flexibility

02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:40.180
to meet the testing requirements according

02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:42.100
to the needs of their local contacts.

02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:46.220
So for the Smarter Balanced summative assessments

02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:50.820
for English Language Arts, Literacy and Mathematics,

02:00:50.820 --> 02:00:52.820
the California Science Test,

02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:54.660
the California Spanish Assessment

02:00:54.660 --> 02:00:56.180
and the summative ALPAC,

02:00:56.180 --> 02:00:59.300
the California Department of Education recommends

02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:02.940
the following test administration options for spring.

02:01:02.940 --> 02:01:05.740
Any person adhering to state, county

02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:08.220
and local health and safety requirements

02:01:08.220 --> 02:01:11.620
and remote using monitoring tools, cameras, speakers

02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:14.460
or chats during the test session.

02:01:21.380 --> 02:01:26.380
Of course, for the students with the most significant

02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:30.580
cognitive disabilities identify as eligible

02:01:30.580 --> 02:01:33.980
to participate in the California alternate assessments

02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:39.460
which includes the California alternate assessments

02:01:39.460 --> 02:01:41.900
for English Language Arts, Maths, Science

02:01:41.900 --> 02:01:45.700
or the alternate ALPAC operational field tests.

02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:49.820
Additional considerations are made or are being made

02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:54.900
since the California alternates are administered one-on-one

02:01:54.900 --> 02:01:57.780
by test examiners who are familiar with the student,

02:01:58.820 --> 02:02:02.580
including their preferred communication mode,

02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:05.740
their need for specialized accessibility resources

02:02:05.740 --> 02:02:09.660
such as manipulatives and assistive technology supports

02:02:09.660 --> 02:02:13.100
related to identify medical and health issues.

02:02:14.420 --> 02:02:17.620
So after a careful review of the necessary requirements

02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:20.580
for the delivery of the California alternate assessments

02:02:22.060 --> 02:02:25.620
for the English Language Arts, Mathematics and Science,

02:02:25.620 --> 02:02:28.140
the California Department of Education

02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:31.260
recommends in-person test administration,

02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:36.260
a hearing to state, county and local health

02:02:36.780 --> 02:02:40.460
and safety requirements,

02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:43.220
including the California Department of Education

02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:46.940
Industrial Relations Division of Occupational Safety

02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:50.860
and Health COVID-19 Emergency Temporary Standards

02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:53.980
and any local collectively bargain safety protocols.

02:02:55.060 --> 02:02:57.820
Remote administration is not recommended.

02:02:57.820 --> 02:03:01.180
The assistive technology supports are not conducive

02:03:02.100 --> 02:03:03.300
to a remote testing environment

02:03:03.300 --> 02:03:06.340
and require support from a test examiner.

02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:09.940
And also parents or guardians should not be asked

02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:11.500
to administer the assessment

02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:15.340
as our testing regulations do not allow

02:03:15.340 --> 02:03:16.700
for their participation.

02:03:20.420 --> 02:03:23.140
As for continuing on with considerations

02:03:23.140 --> 02:03:25.820
for alternate assessments.

02:03:26.620 --> 02:03:29.940
In addition, given the concerns regarding the administration

02:03:29.940 --> 02:03:31.620
of our alternate assessments,

02:03:31.620 --> 02:03:35.060
the CDE is postponing the alternate

02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:36.740
LPAC operational field tests

02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:40.620
until the 2021-2022 school year.

02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:43.740
Local educational agencies for this school year,

02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:47.380
the 2020-2021 school year,

02:03:47.380 --> 02:03:50.100
local educational agencies will continue

02:03:50.100 --> 02:03:55.100
to administer their locally determined alternate assessments,

02:03:55.740 --> 02:03:57.580
again, following state, county,

02:03:57.580 --> 02:04:00.420
local health and safety requirements.

02:04:00.420 --> 02:04:04.500
And the testing window there is from February 1st

02:04:04.500 --> 02:04:05.660
through May 31st.

02:04:10.660 --> 02:04:13.980
So in fall 2020,

02:04:13.980 --> 02:04:17.580
the CDE recommended that local educational agencies

02:04:17.580 --> 02:04:20.580
administer the LPAC assessments in person

02:04:20.580 --> 02:04:22.340
were safe to do so,

02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:24.380
and that they use remote administration

02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:26.820
as a second option when necessary.

02:04:27.580 --> 02:04:31.260
So with the recent resurgence of COVID-19,

02:04:31.260 --> 02:04:34.820
it is possible that the primary mode of administration

02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:36.860
may become remote.

02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:39.500
So among the challenges that have surfaced

02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:42.460
for stakeholders in this shift in context

02:04:42.460 --> 02:04:46.420
are issues with bandwidth and internet access,

02:04:46.420 --> 02:04:49.300
lack of local resources to install secure browsers

02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:53.220
on devices used by students in remote environments.

02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:55.660
And during the fall LPAC administrations,

02:04:55.660 --> 02:05:00.660
we saw firsthand that challenges and difficulties,

02:05:01.900 --> 02:05:05.500
as previously mentioned, were there.

02:05:05.500 --> 02:05:07.260
And due to these challenges,

02:05:07.260 --> 02:05:10.820
questions have come about regarding the use

02:05:10.820 --> 02:05:14.740
of assessment data and the comparability of data

02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:15.860
to past years.

02:05:19.340 --> 02:05:23.980
So the challenges identified for summative assessments

02:05:24.020 --> 02:05:26.340
are really not unique.

02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:28.180
With all the unknowns this year,

02:05:28.180 --> 02:05:31.980
we may not be able to fully implement summative assessments.

02:05:31.980 --> 02:05:34.580
As I stated in the November meeting,

02:05:34.580 --> 02:05:38.740
these multiple options can put us on the path

02:05:38.740 --> 02:05:41.540
to be able to collect as much information as possible

02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:44.180
during this very difficult year.

02:05:44.180 --> 02:05:47.180
So the summative testing window opened yesterday

02:05:47.180 --> 02:05:49.380
for some CASP assessments.

02:05:50.380 --> 02:05:53.060
CDE will monitor the data.

02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:54.380
From the summative assessments

02:05:54.380 --> 02:05:57.060
throughout the statewide testing window.

02:05:57.060 --> 02:06:00.980
And we do not know at this time what data would be available

02:06:00.980 --> 02:06:05.980
and would be cautious with any data interpretation or usage.

02:06:06.700 --> 02:06:08.820
And I want to remind us that the importance

02:06:08.820 --> 02:06:12.540
of having a comprehensive data collection system

02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:14.340
that includes assessments,

02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:18.380
along with multiple measures collected locally

02:06:18.380 --> 02:06:20.860
can be used to inform decisions.

02:06:24.060 --> 02:06:29.060
Now I will give you some quick updates

02:06:29.740 --> 02:06:31.420
on the CASP assessments,

02:06:31.420 --> 02:06:33.260
specifically the science tests,

02:06:33.260 --> 02:06:38.260
along with others that have updates.

02:06:40.220 --> 02:06:44.900
So first off, we will talk a little bit

02:06:44.900 --> 02:06:49.900
about the 2021 CASP administration.

02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:53.420
And the CDE will continue to use

02:06:53.420 --> 02:06:58.020
the November 2017 SBE approved blueprint.

02:06:58.020 --> 02:07:02.180
And as a reminder, the CASP is aligned

02:07:02.180 --> 02:07:06.100
with the California Next Generation Science Standards

02:07:06.100 --> 02:07:08.780
or California NGSS.

02:07:08.780 --> 02:07:11.460
It is administered to all eligible students

02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:14.460
in grades five, eight, and once in high school.

02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:23.940
Some additional updates that we were,

02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:25.980
along the way we have been providing you

02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:28.740
some updates on the science resources.

02:07:29.980 --> 02:07:34.980
During two workshops in April and June of 2020,

02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:41.220
the CDE and the Sacramento County Office of Education

02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:45.340
worked on collaboration with the California science teachers

02:07:45.340 --> 02:07:48.060
and educational coaches from across the state

02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:52.060
to develop the 38 science formative assessment resources

02:07:52.060 --> 02:07:54.980
for elementary grades K through five.

02:07:54.980 --> 02:07:56.180
And during these workshops,

02:07:56.180 --> 02:07:58.180
the participants did collaborate

02:07:58.180 --> 02:08:01.860
using a peer review process to create resources

02:08:01.860 --> 02:08:05.540
that included instructional differentiation

02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:07.780
by incorporating formative assessments

02:08:07.780 --> 02:08:11.260
and accessibility strategies.

02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:14.260
And there are 16 science resources

02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:17.260
that are currently available in the Tools for Teachers

02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:21.900
that California educators can access.

02:08:21.900 --> 02:08:24.900
And we are making plans to continue its work

02:08:24.900 --> 02:08:26.700
with the California science educators

02:08:26.700 --> 02:08:29.580
during the school year to develop additional

02:08:29.580 --> 02:08:31.700
science formative assessment resources

02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:34.380
for inclusion in the Tools for Teachers.

02:08:38.900 --> 02:08:43.740
So the CDE and Educational Testing Service

02:08:43.740 --> 02:08:45.700
will continue the development and work

02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:50.580
on the California Alternate Assessment for Science.

02:08:50.580 --> 02:08:54.060
As part of these efforts in March, 2021,

02:08:54.060 --> 02:08:58.100
the CDE will convene and our contractor will convene

02:08:58.100 --> 02:09:01.940
a virtual range achievement level descriptor meeting

02:09:01.940 --> 02:09:06.300
with California educators to review and provide feedback

02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:08.780
on the California Alternate Assessment for Science

02:09:08.780 --> 02:09:11.580
grade level range achievement level descriptors

02:09:11.580 --> 02:09:14.620
in preparation for the August, 2021

02:09:15.860 --> 02:09:18.540
California Alternate Assessment for Science

02:09:18.540 --> 02:09:20.580
standard setting meeting.

02:09:20.580 --> 02:09:25.180
So the range achievement level descriptors

02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:27.940
describe what students know and can do in science

02:09:27.940 --> 02:09:31.300
in each of the three achievement levels.

02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:35.940
Level one is really, level one is limited understanding,

02:09:35.940 --> 02:09:38.780
level two is foundational understanding,

02:09:38.780 --> 02:09:43.780
and level three is understanding of the science standards.

02:09:44.780 --> 02:09:48.500
So following the standard setting in August, 2021,

02:09:48.500 --> 02:09:51.900
the CDE will seek the approval of the recommended

02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:55.620
California Alternate Assessment for Science

02:09:55.620 --> 02:09:58.300
threshold scores from the State Board of Education

02:09:58.300 --> 02:09:59.140
in November.

02:10:04.740 --> 02:10:07.540
So to assist parents and guardians in understanding

02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:11.740
their child's California Alternate Assessment for Science,

02:10:11.740 --> 02:10:14.580
there's some additions to our starting smarter site.

02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:21.140
The CDE has made available the starting smarter webpage,

02:10:21.140 --> 02:10:25.780
which can be found on our CASP starting smarter website.

02:10:25.780 --> 02:10:30.780
And these family focus webpages provide resources

02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:35.740
to empower parents to become involved in their children's

02:10:35.740 --> 02:10:39.380
educational progress and parents and guardians

02:10:40.340 --> 02:10:43.220
can visit the websites to review a sample

02:10:43.220 --> 02:10:45.660
student score report, or SSR,

02:10:48.260 --> 02:10:51.260
to review examples of test questions

02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:54.140
and to obtain a downloadable guide with suggestions

02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:57.020
on how to prepare for parent teacher conferences,

02:10:58.100 --> 02:11:01.540
as well as access other helpful resources

02:11:01.540 --> 02:11:03.940
to support their child's learning at home.

02:11:04.300 --> 02:11:07.300
Another update is with the interim assessment

02:11:07.300 --> 02:11:08.700
hand scoring workshops.

02:11:11.660 --> 02:11:14.340
And these involve the Smarter Balanced

02:11:14.340 --> 02:11:16.620
interim assessment items.

02:11:16.620 --> 02:11:19.220
They continue to be available.

02:11:19.220 --> 02:11:22.380
These workshops begin in December

02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:25.140
and will be offered through April 2021

02:11:25.140 --> 02:11:29.180
to local educational agency staff free of charge.

02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:31.300
There are 20 sessions being offered

02:11:31.420 --> 02:11:33.820
10 focusing on the hand scoring of English language

02:11:33.820 --> 02:11:37.020
arts items and 10 focusing on mathematics.

02:11:38.340 --> 02:11:40.380
To accommodate different teacher schedules

02:11:40.380 --> 02:11:43.340
to format options are being offered

02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:45.660
in this four hour workshop.

02:11:45.660 --> 02:11:48.020
Half of the workshops are offered

02:11:48.020 --> 02:11:49.660
in a single four hour session

02:11:49.660 --> 02:11:52.060
and half of the workshops will be offered

02:11:52.060 --> 02:11:55.380
over three shorter sessions of teachers

02:11:55.380 --> 02:11:57.260
can attend after school hours.

02:11:57.460 --> 02:12:01.420
Each workshop can accommodate up to 50 educators per session

02:12:01.420 --> 02:12:05.940
with a total of 1000 educators for the series.

02:12:05.940 --> 02:12:08.660
These workshops engage educators and activities

02:12:08.660 --> 02:12:12.060
that promote understanding the process of hand scoring

02:12:12.060 --> 02:12:14.860
the Smarter Balanced assessment items

02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:18.220
for a deeper understanding of the content standards

02:12:18.220 --> 02:12:21.140
and strengthening the evaluation of student work

02:12:21.140 --> 02:12:23.100
and the quality of the content.

02:12:23.100 --> 02:12:25.140
These workshops will be available

02:12:25.180 --> 02:12:27.340
for strengthening the evaluation of student work

02:12:27.340 --> 02:12:30.300
and promoting the use of student results

02:12:30.300 --> 02:12:33.620
in informed teaching and learning.

02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:37.540
So the LEA staff, if anybody would like to register

02:12:37.540 --> 02:12:41.460
for these workshops, there is a link provided

02:12:41.460 --> 02:12:43.580
in this month's board item.

02:12:48.100 --> 02:12:51.540
In addition, I'd like to share with you

02:12:51.540 --> 02:12:53.660
that in November 2020,

02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:55.620
the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium

02:12:55.620 --> 02:12:57.620
released a new web application

02:12:57.620 --> 02:13:02.620
called the Smarter Annotated Response Tool.

02:13:02.820 --> 02:13:04.980
And this new tool is designed

02:13:04.980 --> 02:13:07.380
to help educators better understand the rubrics

02:13:07.380 --> 02:13:10.780
that are used to score students written responses

02:13:10.780 --> 02:13:13.300
to Smarter Balanced constructive response items

02:13:13.300 --> 02:13:16.460
and performance tasks for English language arts.

02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:19.700
Because all the items in this tool

02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:22.260
are practice and sample items,

02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:25.820
this web application is publicly available.

02:13:25.820 --> 02:13:28.780
The Smarter Annotated Response Tool

02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:30.940
makes hand scoring training more efficient

02:13:30.940 --> 02:13:33.780
and have the examples of student writing,

02:13:33.780 --> 02:13:38.460
scoring annotations and rubrics all in one place online.

02:13:38.460 --> 02:13:42.380
And it helps educators understand what to look for

02:13:42.380 --> 02:13:44.460
when reviewing student responses

02:13:44.460 --> 02:13:48.220
and where to provide support to students

02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:51.060
and provides a professional learning resource

02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:54.100
that educators can use as they work to standardize

02:13:54.100 --> 02:13:57.660
and calibrate their scoring of student writing samples.

02:13:59.860 --> 02:14:02.260
So CDE staff, along with the staff

02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:03.980
from the consortium member states

02:14:03.980 --> 02:14:06.500
participated in a steering committee

02:14:06.500 --> 02:14:10.460
to provide feedback and conduct system testing

02:14:10.460 --> 02:14:13.420
during the development of this new web application.

02:14:13.420 --> 02:14:17.020
We anticipate that future enhancements to this tool

02:14:17.020 --> 02:14:20.020
will include the addition of sample student responses

02:14:20.020 --> 02:14:24.580
for mathematics and the Smarter Annotated Response Tool

02:14:24.580 --> 02:14:28.980
is available through the CDE and ATS CASP web pages

02:14:28.980 --> 02:14:32.740
and is being advertised in our correspondences

02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:36.540
to the local educational agencies and in trainings.

02:14:40.140 --> 02:14:45.140
So that sums up the updates for our assessment programs.

02:14:46.140 --> 02:14:49.460
I have the recommendation recap here.

02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:54.420
Again, the California Department of Education

02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:57.300
seeks approval on the proposed goals and priorities

02:14:57.300 --> 02:15:00.060
to be included in the California assessment system

02:15:00.060 --> 02:15:01.980
request for qualifications,

02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:05.020
stage three written formal submission

02:15:05.020 --> 02:15:07.100
for the next assessment contract.

02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:13.100
And the proposed goals and priorities for stage three are here.

02:15:13.740 --> 02:15:17.020
And I will stop talking.

02:15:17.020 --> 02:15:22.020
And that takes me to the end of our presentation.

02:15:25.140 --> 02:15:26.340
Thank you so much, Mal.

02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:29.060
And thanks for all of the amazing work

02:15:29.060 --> 02:15:30.420
that you and your team have done

02:15:30.420 --> 02:15:34.260
in all of these different areas of the assessment process.

02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:37.220
It's really quite extraordinary.

02:15:37.220 --> 02:15:40.100
And we are in these extraordinary times.

02:15:40.100 --> 02:15:44.220
I know there will be comments

02:15:44.220 --> 02:15:45.580
that board members will want to make

02:15:45.580 --> 02:15:50.580
about what we are looking at for assessment coming up.

02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:52.820
We also will have public comment

02:15:53.740 --> 02:15:56.860
and just to put a little framework on it,

02:15:58.220 --> 02:16:03.220
the current status as Rachel laid out at the beginning

02:16:04.220 --> 02:16:08.180
is that, of course, while we have all kinds of questions

02:16:08.180 --> 02:16:09.700
about what will happen with schools

02:16:09.700 --> 02:16:12.060
as COVID rates are soaring again,

02:16:12.060 --> 02:16:14.780
and as districts are trying to figure out

02:16:14.780 --> 02:16:16.540
how to calibrate their plans

02:16:16.540 --> 02:16:19.100
to bring people back in person,

02:16:19.100 --> 02:16:21.020
vaccinations are going out,

02:16:21.020 --> 02:16:23.980
there's all kinds of variables

02:16:23.980 --> 02:16:25.220
that could make a difference

02:16:25.220 --> 02:16:27.940
in our ability to move forward this spring.

02:16:28.900 --> 02:16:33.460
The current administration, just as a reminder,

02:16:33.460 --> 02:16:37.100
had offered the possibility of some flexibilities

02:16:37.100 --> 02:16:40.180
in tying assessments to decisions

02:16:40.180 --> 02:16:45.180
about intervention and support status, CSI or TSI,

02:16:47.060 --> 02:16:50.460
but not with respect to assessments themselves.

02:16:50.460 --> 02:16:53.380
On January 20th, a new administration

02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:56.980
will take over the reins in Washington,

02:16:56.980 --> 02:17:00.260
which may or may not result in some changes

02:17:00.260 --> 02:17:03.660
in the flexibilities that may be considered

02:17:03.660 --> 02:17:07.700
in the assessment delivery context.

02:17:11.100 --> 02:17:13.700
We have already taken action

02:17:13.700 --> 02:17:16.380
to shorten the Smarter Balanced assessments

02:17:16.380 --> 02:17:21.380
in reading and math so that they can be more easily given

02:17:21.580 --> 02:17:23.860
if we're able to move ahead with that

02:17:23.860 --> 02:17:26.420
in remote form, in person form.

02:17:27.420 --> 02:17:31.460
And we've been developing progress

02:17:31.460 --> 02:17:34.220
towards our growth model for assessment,

02:17:34.220 --> 02:17:36.180
but we also have to be very cognizant

02:17:36.180 --> 02:17:38.500
of the moment that we're in.

02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:43.500
So what I'd like to do is restrict any questions right now

02:17:43.980 --> 02:17:48.980
to MAL, to technical issues or clarifications

02:17:50.140 --> 02:17:54.580
about what technical issues that we need to vote on,

02:17:54.580 --> 02:17:58.540
go to public comment, and then come back to the board

02:17:58.540 --> 02:18:01.620
and enable everyone to have an opportunity

02:18:01.620 --> 02:18:04.980
to share your thoughts about the assessment questions

02:18:04.980 --> 02:18:07.340
that will be ahead of us.

02:18:07.340 --> 02:18:12.340
We cannot act on anything having to do with the waivers

02:18:12.900 --> 02:18:17.900
at this moment that might be asked about down the road.

02:18:18.700 --> 02:18:23.220
We need to wait for the new administration to arrive.

02:18:23.220 --> 02:18:27.340
So we will have to hear from people, take stock,

02:18:27.340 --> 02:18:30.020
and then perhaps even at some point,

02:18:30.020 --> 02:18:33.460
shortly reconvene if there are any changes

02:18:33.460 --> 02:18:36.300
to our current course of action.

02:18:36.300 --> 02:18:38.020
So just wanted to give everyone a framework

02:18:38.020 --> 02:18:42.100
for what we're working with here is a complicated moment

02:18:42.100 --> 02:18:44.300
with a complicated item.

02:18:44.300 --> 02:18:48.340
So with that said, are there any clarification questions

02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:50.220
that you need to ask MAL

02:18:50.220 --> 02:18:53.540
about the technical aspects of her presentation?

02:18:54.540 --> 02:18:58.300
And I'm not seeing any emerging.

02:18:58.300 --> 02:18:59.780
So if that is the case,

02:18:59.780 --> 02:19:02.780
I want to be sure that we can get queued up

02:19:02.780 --> 02:19:03.980
for public comment.

02:19:07.140 --> 02:19:08.220
Members of the public,

02:19:08.220 --> 02:19:10.620
do we have the slide up for public comment?

02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:11.660
Can we put that up?

02:19:14.900 --> 02:19:17.740
Alex, I think this is stuck.

02:19:17.740 --> 02:19:20.020
I can't move the slide anymore.

02:19:20.100 --> 02:19:22.140
Oh, okay.

02:19:22.140 --> 02:19:23.300
I'll try some other.

02:19:24.420 --> 02:19:26.380
The issues with technology,

02:19:26.380 --> 02:19:29.340
which we all experience,

02:19:29.340 --> 02:19:32.500
which are part of the challenge that we are discussing.

02:19:33.620 --> 02:19:35.780
So I'm gonna note that members of the public

02:19:35.780 --> 02:19:39.060
wishing to provide comment on this item may do so

02:19:39.060 --> 02:19:43.380
by calling 712-432-0075.

02:19:45.500 --> 02:19:46.500
Is it coming up?

02:19:46.500 --> 02:19:47.620
There we go.

02:19:47.620 --> 02:19:49.580
Call the number on the slide

02:19:50.140 --> 02:19:52.820
and use the public access code that is there.

02:19:52.820 --> 02:19:55.140
And then while we're waiting for members of the public

02:19:55.140 --> 02:19:56.660
to call in, I'll ask member Sun

02:19:56.660 --> 02:19:59.860
if she has some initial comments.

02:19:59.860 --> 02:20:01.260
We'll hear from the public

02:20:01.260 --> 02:20:03.580
and then we'll come back for more discussion.

02:20:03.580 --> 02:20:04.580
Member Sun?

02:20:04.580 --> 02:20:06.380
Yes, thank you.

02:20:06.380 --> 02:20:09.140
Yeah, I had no clarifying questions,

02:20:09.140 --> 02:20:11.180
but I did want to just say that,

02:20:11.180 --> 02:20:15.420
I appreciate President Darling-Hammond's comments

02:20:15.420 --> 02:20:18.140
that we are working with many, many variables

02:20:18.140 --> 02:20:20.940
and I appreciate Deputy Superintendent Maves

02:20:20.940 --> 02:20:25.940
and Director Mao for their work in this area

02:20:25.940 --> 02:20:28.300
and trying to provide as much support

02:20:28.300 --> 02:20:31.060
as possible for the field.

02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:35.100
At the same time, as a school administrator,

02:20:35.100 --> 02:20:38.660
my anxiety just rises when I start hearing

02:20:38.660 --> 02:20:42.100
about administering these assessments

02:20:42.100 --> 02:20:44.180
over this next few months.

02:20:44.180 --> 02:20:46.660
So I just wanna make sure that the field understands

02:20:46.660 --> 02:20:48.700
that we are not tone deaf.

02:20:48.700 --> 02:20:51.620
We are working with many, many variables

02:20:51.620 --> 02:20:55.540
and so we have to kind of work through this

02:20:55.540 --> 02:20:58.100
based on what we have right now.

02:20:58.100 --> 02:21:03.100
But I just wanted to assure that we are moving forward

02:21:03.420 --> 02:21:06.420
with the best intent possible

02:21:06.420 --> 02:21:09.540
and understanding what the field is going through

02:21:09.540 --> 02:21:13.300
and the logistics of administering assessments

02:21:13.300 --> 02:21:15.740
in these very unprecedented times.

02:21:17.660 --> 02:21:21.580
Great, and with that, we'll turn to public comment.

02:21:21.580 --> 02:21:24.740
Do we have any public commenters?

02:21:24.740 --> 02:21:25.580
Yes, we do.

02:21:25.580 --> 02:21:28.020
We have quite a few people in the queue for public comment

02:21:28.020 --> 02:21:30.300
and this is for item number three.

02:21:30.300 --> 02:21:32.100
I will open up the phone lines now.

02:21:34.060 --> 02:21:34.940
Good morning, caller.

02:21:34.940 --> 02:21:36.940
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:21:36.940 --> 02:21:38.020
Your time starts now.

02:21:38.020 --> 02:21:38.980
You have one minute.

02:21:47.660 --> 02:21:49.660
Good morning, this is Andrea Ball

02:21:49.660 --> 02:21:52.980
on behalf of the Central Valley Education Coalition.

02:21:52.980 --> 02:21:56.780
Really appreciate the CDE's presentation

02:21:56.780 --> 02:21:59.940
and Board Member Sun, your comments

02:21:59.940 --> 02:22:01.940
and President Darling-Hammond.

02:22:01.940 --> 02:22:05.580
We sent a letter outlining some very practical concerns

02:22:05.580 --> 02:22:07.740
about going forward with the CAS

02:22:07.740 --> 02:22:10.620
as well as challenges with the LPAC.

02:22:10.620 --> 02:22:14.220
The Central Valley Education Coalition represents

02:22:14.700 --> 02:22:16.900
school districts, county superintendents

02:22:16.900 --> 02:22:19.700
in six Central Valley counties,

02:22:19.700 --> 02:22:23.700
over 400,000 students, 128 local agencies.

02:22:23.700 --> 02:22:25.500
Most of them have been closed.

02:22:25.500 --> 02:22:29.260
They have very high rates, most of them, of COVID-19.

02:22:29.260 --> 02:22:33.380
So I think the administration of the CAS and the LPAC

02:22:33.380 --> 02:22:36.500
just present concerns about the administration

02:22:36.500 --> 02:22:39.940
as Director Vang outlined.

02:22:39.940 --> 02:22:42.140
There's very disparate concerns

02:22:42.180 --> 02:22:45.180
about the Internet connectivity in the Central Valley.

02:22:45.180 --> 02:22:48.700
Also, accommodations for students are very challenging

02:22:48.700 --> 02:22:53.700
and really worried about the utility of the information.

02:22:54.380 --> 02:22:55.220
Thank you so much.

02:22:55.220 --> 02:22:56.060
Thank you.

02:23:01.380 --> 02:23:02.220
Good morning.

02:23:02.220 --> 02:23:04.180
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:23:04.180 --> 02:23:06.580
You have one minute and your time starts now.

02:23:06.740 --> 02:23:08.220
Good morning, State Board members.

02:23:08.220 --> 02:23:09.540
My name is Lorraine Richards.

02:23:09.540 --> 02:23:10.620
I'm a classroom teacher

02:23:10.620 --> 02:23:13.420
representing the California Teachers Association.

02:23:13.420 --> 02:23:17.740
CTA appreciates the CDE's efforts to update the field

02:23:17.740 --> 02:23:20.620
regarding their activities and efforts on statewide testing

02:23:20.620 --> 02:23:22.940
and greatly appreciates the hard work of Malvang

02:23:22.940 --> 02:23:25.260
and her staff for engaging with CTA

02:23:25.260 --> 02:23:28.860
and incorporating our feedback within this item.

02:23:28.860 --> 02:23:31.100
The devastating impact of COVID-19

02:23:31.100 --> 02:23:33.820
has been felt by the entire state of California

02:23:33.900 --> 02:23:35.500
in this item.

02:23:35.500 --> 02:23:37.420
The devastating impact of the pandemic

02:23:37.420 --> 02:23:40.900
continues to ravage so many communities across our state,

02:23:40.900 --> 02:23:43.380
especially our low income communities.

02:23:43.380 --> 02:23:46.580
And there is no way to safely administer the assessments.

02:23:46.580 --> 02:23:48.940
Our state's focus must be on supporting

02:23:48.940 --> 02:23:50.260
our most vulnerable students

02:23:50.260 --> 02:23:52.300
and not forcing assessments

02:23:52.300 --> 02:23:54.620
that will be a logistical nightmare

02:23:54.620 --> 02:23:57.700
and provide data that is not valid nor reliable.

02:23:57.700 --> 02:23:59.900
Our educators continue to go above and beyond

02:23:59.900 --> 02:24:00.940
in supporting our students

02:24:00.940 --> 02:24:03.540
and almost 15,000 have signed a petition

02:24:03.540 --> 02:24:05.060
to request a waiver.

02:24:05.060 --> 02:24:07.420
We ask the state board to join the educators

02:24:07.420 --> 02:24:09.900
that have signed our petition to request a waiver

02:24:09.900 --> 02:24:12.060
from the U.S. Department of Education.

02:24:12.060 --> 02:24:13.020
Thank you.

02:24:13.020 --> 02:24:13.860
Thank you.

02:24:17.220 --> 02:24:18.180
Good morning.

02:24:18.180 --> 02:24:19.420
Caller, please state your name

02:24:19.420 --> 02:24:20.940
and affiliation for the record.

02:24:20.940 --> 02:24:21.780
You have one minute.

02:24:21.780 --> 02:24:22.820
Your time starts now.

02:24:24.540 --> 02:24:27.740
Hi, this is Jessica Sacco on behalf of Children Now.

02:24:27.740 --> 02:24:30.580
We support CDE's proposed direction on this item

02:24:30.580 --> 02:24:33.340
regarding the goals and priorities

02:24:33.340 --> 02:24:35.580
for future assessment contracts.

02:24:35.580 --> 02:24:37.660
We also have a couple of suggestions

02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:39.940
as the process moves forward.

02:24:39.940 --> 02:24:43.620
We urge the board to consider in the coming years

02:24:44.540 --> 02:24:48.180
how to prioritize and incorporate sufficient capacity

02:24:48.180 --> 02:24:49.980
for the contractor to support the work

02:24:49.980 --> 02:24:52.260
of developing the student growth model,

02:24:52.260 --> 02:24:55.380
particularly capacity for analysis of the data,

02:24:55.380 --> 02:24:57.100
development of tools and resources

02:24:57.100 --> 02:24:59.260
to communicate about the growth model

02:24:59.260 --> 02:25:01.140
and inform educators and the public

02:25:01.140 --> 02:25:03.100
about this new accountability tool.

02:25:04.060 --> 02:25:05.860
Also, we would like to applaud CDE

02:25:05.860 --> 02:25:06.780
for their work to develop

02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:08.940
science formative assessment tools for teachers,

02:25:08.940 --> 02:25:11.580
including the focus on K-5 resources,

02:25:11.580 --> 02:25:13.100
the integration of the three dimensions

02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:15.180
of the next generation science standards,

02:25:15.180 --> 02:25:18.540
and the integration of science with other subject areas.

02:25:18.540 --> 02:25:19.380
Thank you.

02:25:19.380 --> 02:25:20.220
Thank you.

02:25:22.820 --> 02:25:23.700
Good morning, caller.

02:25:23.700 --> 02:25:25.780
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:25:25.780 --> 02:25:26.900
Your time starts now.

02:25:27.900 --> 02:25:28.740
Good morning.

02:25:28.740 --> 02:25:29.900
This is Sarah Lilas,

02:25:29.900 --> 02:25:32.340
Executive Director for Teach Plus California.

02:25:32.340 --> 02:25:34.740
We appreciate the update from Dr. Vang

02:25:34.740 --> 02:25:36.660
around the spring administration.

02:25:36.660 --> 02:25:38.740
I think I may have to watch that video a few times

02:25:38.740 --> 02:25:40.060
to gather all of the updates,

02:25:40.060 --> 02:25:43.060
but we're encouraged by many of the steps taken

02:25:43.060 --> 02:25:44.180
around communication,

02:25:44.180 --> 02:25:46.500
because our teachers believe communication to students

02:25:46.500 --> 02:25:48.660
and families and educators is essential

02:25:48.660 --> 02:25:50.740
to ensuring equitable testing.

02:25:50.740 --> 02:25:52.100
On the issue of a scope of work

02:25:52.100 --> 02:25:53.460
for the next assessment contract,

02:25:53.460 --> 02:25:56.220
our teacher leaders want to recommend

02:25:56.220 --> 02:25:58.180
that the state board provide more specific guidance

02:25:58.180 --> 02:26:01.060
for the expectations under enhancing development

02:26:01.060 --> 02:26:04.060
of high quality assessments, specifically around math.

02:26:04.060 --> 02:26:06.220
As you heard the discussion of the new math framework

02:26:06.220 --> 02:26:10.100
and the emphasis on big idea standards in math practice,

02:26:10.100 --> 02:26:11.980
we don't see that reflected in the assessment,

02:26:11.980 --> 02:26:15.020
and we hope in future iterations that it is.

02:26:15.020 --> 02:26:16.540
We also concur with the recommendations

02:26:16.540 --> 02:26:18.820
of the equity coalition that the board include

02:26:18.820 --> 02:26:21.820
in its goals and priorities sufficient capacity

02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:23.420
for the contractor to support the work

02:26:23.420 --> 02:26:24.820
of developing the growth model,

02:26:24.820 --> 02:26:27.660
including analysis of the data and communication tools.

02:26:27.660 --> 02:26:28.620
Thank you.

02:26:28.620 --> 02:26:29.460
Thank you.

02:26:33.020 --> 02:26:33.860
Good morning, caller.

02:26:33.860 --> 02:26:36.100
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:26:36.100 --> 02:26:37.260
Your time starts now.

02:26:38.420 --> 02:26:39.260
Good morning.

02:26:39.260 --> 02:26:41.060
Edgar Salsueta on behalf of the Association

02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:43.660
of California School Administrators.

02:26:43.660 --> 02:26:46.340
We want to echo the appreciation to CDE and the state board

02:26:46.340 --> 02:26:49.660
for some of the flexibility that's already been provided

02:26:49.660 --> 02:26:51.540
through previous actions.

02:26:51.540 --> 02:26:54.340
With that said, we do remain concerned about the validity

02:26:54.860 --> 02:26:57.700
and the use of any data that we might obtain this year,

02:26:57.700 --> 02:27:00.060
and we don't believe that any of that data should be used

02:27:00.060 --> 02:27:02.500
for the purposes of accountability.

02:27:02.500 --> 02:27:04.740
Not to mention the concern we have about the inequities

02:27:04.740 --> 02:27:07.180
that students face right now with internet access

02:27:07.180 --> 02:27:10.260
or testing environment and the hurdles

02:27:10.260 --> 02:27:11.940
that our administrators are gonna face

02:27:11.940 --> 02:27:14.900
in administering these tests.

02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:16.900
So this has been echoed by many.

02:27:16.900 --> 02:27:21.900
We asked the administration to consider taking this

02:27:21.900 --> 02:27:25.460
to the federal government, the new administration,

02:27:25.460 --> 02:27:27.740
and asking for a waiver of assistance this year.

02:27:27.740 --> 02:27:29.340
Thank you for your consideration.

02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:30.180
Thank you.

02:27:34.780 --> 02:27:35.620
Good morning.

02:27:35.620 --> 02:27:37.260
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:27:37.260 --> 02:27:38.260
Your time starts now.

02:27:38.260 --> 02:27:40.100
You have one minute.

02:27:40.100 --> 02:27:43.300
This is Mary Perry from the California State PTA,

02:27:43.300 --> 02:27:46.300
and we want to first echo the appreciation

02:27:46.300 --> 02:27:48.300
for all the work that the department has done

02:27:48.300 --> 02:27:51.980
to adapt the CAS testing system to the current situation

02:27:51.980 --> 02:27:54.220
and provide the other assessment resources

02:27:54.220 --> 02:27:56.620
to support teaching and learning.

02:27:58.340 --> 02:28:00.420
We also want to support the plan

02:28:00.420 --> 02:28:02.900
to conduct some kinds of assessments

02:28:02.900 --> 02:28:04.860
despite the challenges involved.

02:28:04.860 --> 02:28:06.900
The information gained from accountability

02:28:06.900 --> 02:28:08.620
should not, from assessment,

02:28:08.620 --> 02:28:10.900
should not be used for accountability,

02:28:10.900 --> 02:28:15.580
but we have a lot of potential to provide leaders

02:28:15.580 --> 02:28:16.820
both locally and in the state

02:28:16.820 --> 02:28:18.980
with some understanding of the impact this year

02:28:18.980 --> 02:28:20.900
has had on student learning

02:28:20.900 --> 02:28:23.860
and what needs to be done to address that impact.

02:28:23.860 --> 02:28:26.420
That's vital understanding for students,

02:28:26.420 --> 02:28:28.860
families, and educators going forward.

02:28:28.860 --> 02:28:30.140
Thank you.

02:28:30.140 --> 02:28:30.980
Thank you.

02:28:33.900 --> 02:28:34.740
Good morning.

02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:36.860
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:28:36.860 --> 02:28:37.700
You have one minute.

02:28:37.700 --> 02:28:38.860
Your time starts now.

02:28:39.660 --> 02:28:41.340
Martha Zaragoza-Diaz,

02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:43.380
representing the California Association

02:28:43.380 --> 02:28:46.380
for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

02:28:46.380 --> 02:28:48.700
Now that the board is reviewing the scope of work

02:28:48.700 --> 02:28:50.220
from potential contractors

02:28:50.220 --> 02:28:51.860
for the next assessment contract,

02:28:51.860 --> 02:28:53.580
we believe it is perfect timing

02:28:53.580 --> 02:28:56.620
to enhance the California Spanish assessment

02:28:56.620 --> 02:28:59.060
and make it a priority as well.

02:28:59.060 --> 02:29:03.140
We recommend including constructed response writing items.

02:29:03.140 --> 02:29:06.620
These items will demonstrate EL's writing proficiency

02:29:06.620 --> 02:29:08.020
in their strongest language

02:29:08.020 --> 02:29:10.500
while developing proficiency in English.

02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:15.020
Develop the CSA so it parallels English language arts.

02:29:15.020 --> 02:29:19.300
There are four proficiency levels for the ELA assessment

02:29:19.300 --> 02:29:21.460
and only three for the CSA,

02:29:21.460 --> 02:29:25.940
which diminishes the opportunities to show growth by EL's.

02:29:25.940 --> 02:29:28.460
And lastly, enhance the number of test items

02:29:28.460 --> 02:29:30.820
to parallel Californians language arts.

02:29:31.700 --> 02:29:34.660
There are fewer items on the CSA,

02:29:34.660 --> 02:29:38.740
therefore doesn't allow for comparison of proficiency

02:29:38.740 --> 02:29:39.860
in English and Spanish

02:29:39.860 --> 02:29:42.500
for students developing bi-literary skills.

02:29:42.500 --> 02:29:44.180
We believe these recommendations

02:29:44.180 --> 02:29:45.580
will strengthen the CSA

02:29:45.580 --> 02:29:48.420
and serve as a model primary language assessment

02:29:48.420 --> 02:29:49.780
for other states.

02:29:49.780 --> 02:29:50.620
Thank you.

02:29:50.620 --> 02:29:51.460
Thank you.

02:29:54.420 --> 02:29:55.260
Good morning.

02:29:55.260 --> 02:29:56.980
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:29:56.980 --> 02:29:57.820
You have one minute.

02:29:57.820 --> 02:29:58.980
Your time starts now.

02:30:00.060 --> 02:30:00.900
Good morning.

02:30:00.900 --> 02:30:03.300
This is Liz Guillen with Public Advocates,

02:30:03.300 --> 02:30:06.700
also for the LCFS Equity Coalition.

02:30:06.700 --> 02:30:08.460
We support the direction

02:30:08.460 --> 02:30:12.220
that the department is going on these contracts.

02:30:12.220 --> 02:30:16.380
We have two goals and priorities we'd like to recommend.

02:30:16.380 --> 02:30:19.420
One is to expand the California Spanish assessment

02:30:19.420 --> 02:30:22.620
so that it includes performance tasks

02:30:22.620 --> 02:30:23.860
and provide support.

02:30:27.740 --> 02:30:30.660
We know that performance tasks contribute

02:30:30.660 --> 02:30:32.780
to our understanding of what students can do.

02:30:32.780 --> 02:30:36.740
So we believe that the state's goals around bi-literacy

02:30:36.740 --> 02:30:41.300
also deserve a similar focus on the depth of understanding

02:30:41.340 --> 02:30:45.740
and performance tasks should be part of the contract.

02:30:46.700 --> 02:30:51.020
The other recommendation is to ensure

02:30:51.020 --> 02:30:54.700
that the contractor can and will support the work

02:30:54.700 --> 02:30:56.620
of developing a growth model

02:30:56.620 --> 02:30:59.100
that includes analysis of the data

02:30:59.100 --> 02:31:02.140
and tools to communicate and educate the public

02:31:02.140 --> 02:31:04.460
about the growth model.

02:31:04.460 --> 02:31:05.300
Time.

02:31:07.180 --> 02:31:08.180
Thank you.

02:31:08.180 --> 02:31:09.020
Thank you.

02:31:11.860 --> 02:31:12.700
Good morning.

02:31:12.700 --> 02:31:14.540
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:31:14.540 --> 02:31:15.380
You have one minute.

02:31:15.380 --> 02:31:16.500
Your time starts now.

02:31:17.420 --> 02:31:21.740
Anne Runge, San Diego Unified School District.

02:31:21.740 --> 02:31:24.100
Good morning and thank you for the honor to speak

02:31:24.100 --> 02:31:26.900
on behalf of San Diego Unified School District.

02:31:26.900 --> 02:31:29.060
We wish to extend our congratulations

02:31:29.060 --> 02:31:33.180
to our newly elected board president and vice president.

02:31:33.180 --> 02:31:35.660
I'm speaking today on behalf of Erica Simmons,

02:31:35.660 --> 02:31:37.620
the director of assessment services,

02:31:37.620 --> 02:31:39.660
who's unable to make today's meeting.

02:31:40.660 --> 02:31:44.220
For our fall 2020 initial LPAC,

02:31:44.220 --> 02:31:47.700
San Diego Unified chose to administer assessments remotely

02:31:47.700 --> 02:31:50.860
to our 3,100 identified students.

02:31:50.860 --> 02:31:53.460
We are excited to announce that we were able to achieve

02:31:53.460 --> 02:31:55.540
a 97% completion rate,

02:31:55.540 --> 02:31:57.060
which is among the top in the state

02:31:57.060 --> 02:31:59.940
for a large urban school district.

02:31:59.940 --> 02:32:02.700
The remote process is allowing San Diego Unified

02:32:02.700 --> 02:32:04.420
to practice safety measures

02:32:04.420 --> 02:32:07.460
in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.

02:32:07.460 --> 02:32:10.540
Teachers, staff, and students are afforded the opportunity

02:32:10.540 --> 02:32:14.100
to test remotely and only when truly necessary.

02:32:14.100 --> 02:32:17.300
Arrangements are made to test in-person

02:32:17.300 --> 02:32:20.180
following strict COVID-19 protocols.

02:32:20.180 --> 02:32:21.540
The support of our office.

02:32:23.980 --> 02:32:24.820
Thank you.

02:32:29.020 --> 02:32:29.860
Good morning.

02:32:29.860 --> 02:32:31.700
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:32:31.700 --> 02:32:32.540
You have one minute.

02:32:32.540 --> 02:32:33.540
Your time starts now.

02:32:35.500 --> 02:32:36.780
Good morning.

02:32:36.780 --> 02:32:39.940
I'm Martha Hernandez, representing Californians Together,

02:32:39.940 --> 02:32:42.940
and we are respectfully asking for the scope of work

02:32:42.940 --> 02:32:44.460
to include the augmentation

02:32:44.460 --> 02:32:47.260
of the California Spanish assessment

02:32:47.260 --> 02:32:49.740
to develop a robust assessment measure

02:32:49.740 --> 02:32:52.420
comparable to our English assessments.

02:32:52.420 --> 02:32:54.500
Also, after meeting with district

02:32:54.500 --> 02:32:57.220
English learner coordinators this week,

02:32:57.220 --> 02:33:00.500
they are reporting that administration

02:33:00.500 --> 02:33:03.220
at the summit of LPAC is very challenging

02:33:03.220 --> 02:33:04.940
for a variety of reasons.

02:33:04.940 --> 02:33:08.580
Parents are having problems downloading the secure browser.

02:33:08.580 --> 02:33:11.260
The district iOS systems need to be updated

02:33:11.260 --> 02:33:13.180
to handle the LPAC.

02:33:13.180 --> 02:33:15.060
iPads need to be reconfigured

02:33:15.060 --> 02:33:17.380
to be able to handle the LPAC,

02:33:17.380 --> 02:33:19.940
requiring students to return all the devices

02:33:19.940 --> 02:33:21.820
in order to reconfigure.

02:33:21.820 --> 02:33:24.340
So we endorse any and all efforts

02:33:24.340 --> 02:33:26.300
to encourage the next administration

02:33:26.300 --> 02:33:30.940
to waive the administration of the summative LPAC for 2021.

02:33:30.940 --> 02:33:31.900
Thank you.

02:33:31.900 --> 02:33:32.740
Thank you.

02:33:35.860 --> 02:33:36.700
Good morning.

02:33:36.700 --> 02:33:38.660
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:33:38.660 --> 02:33:39.580
You have one minute.

02:33:39.580 --> 02:33:40.820
Your time starts now.

02:33:47.060 --> 02:33:49.340
Okay, it looks like that concludes public comment

02:33:49.340 --> 02:33:50.700
for item number three.

02:33:53.980 --> 02:33:54.820
Okay.

02:33:54.820 --> 02:33:56.220
Thank you very much.

02:33:58.900 --> 02:34:00.660
I heard a number of comments

02:34:00.660 --> 02:34:04.980
about both the nature of improvements

02:34:04.980 --> 02:34:08.060
and the assessments that some people would like to see.

02:34:09.300 --> 02:34:12.580
Math and the Spanish language test were particularly mentioned.

02:34:12.580 --> 02:34:13.660
Then I heard other comments

02:34:13.660 --> 02:34:16.980
about the administration of tests this spring.

02:34:16.980 --> 02:34:21.980
So we have kind of two buckets of areas to discuss.

02:34:22.260 --> 02:34:25.660
Only the first of those is associated with an action.

02:34:26.580 --> 02:34:30.140
And we will come back to take action.

02:34:30.180 --> 02:34:31.620
With respect to the,

02:34:31.620 --> 02:34:34.340
just getting input about views

02:34:34.340 --> 02:34:38.540
regarding administration of assessments this year,

02:34:38.540 --> 02:34:41.700
just to classify the various kinds of decisions

02:34:41.700 --> 02:34:44.940
that might be eventually on the table.

02:34:45.980 --> 02:34:50.420
There are decisions about how to give assessments,

02:34:50.420 --> 02:34:52.420
decisions about whether to give assessments.

02:34:52.420 --> 02:34:54.220
We heard some comments on that.

02:34:54.220 --> 02:34:56.380
Decisions about how to give assessments,

02:34:56.380 --> 02:35:00.660
remote, in-person, if students are already in school,

02:35:00.660 --> 02:35:04.460
in-person if they are not in physical school,

02:35:05.420 --> 02:35:09.660
use of diagnostic or interim assessments,

02:35:09.660 --> 02:35:11.980
the use of assessments for accountability decisions

02:35:11.980 --> 02:35:16.020
such as CSI or TSI determinations.

02:35:16.020 --> 02:35:18.580
And then there may also be questions

02:35:18.580 --> 02:35:22.820
about accountability for participation rates that come up.

02:35:22.820 --> 02:35:26.620
All of those are sort of classes of decisions.

02:35:26.620 --> 02:35:28.860
We're glad to hear from each board member.

02:35:28.860 --> 02:35:29.700
I'd like to ask you,

02:35:29.700 --> 02:35:32.420
because there's so much to say,

02:35:32.420 --> 02:35:34.420
if we can go around to each person

02:35:34.420 --> 02:35:38.260
and to hear your views in either or both of those buckets,

02:35:38.260 --> 02:35:41.620
that would be a way to proceed

02:35:43.540 --> 02:35:46.500
in a relatively orderly fashion.

02:35:46.500 --> 02:35:48.900
We all stand between ourselves and lunch.

02:35:48.900 --> 02:35:53.340
So I'll ask you to be succinct in making your views known.

02:35:53.340 --> 02:35:57.740
And I see member Burr, member Strauss,

02:35:57.740 --> 02:35:59.300
I thought I saw member Rucker,

02:36:00.980 --> 02:36:03.260
and then member Rodriguez.

02:36:03.260 --> 02:36:04.700
Member Burr, can you begin?

02:36:06.020 --> 02:36:07.700
Yes.

02:36:07.700 --> 02:36:10.260
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

02:36:10.260 --> 02:36:11.460
So a couple of things.

02:36:11.460 --> 02:36:16.420
I do have a comment on the proposal before us,

02:36:16.420 --> 02:36:19.020
and especially as it relates to the growth model,

02:36:19.020 --> 02:36:20.820
I'd like to hear a little bit more about that,

02:36:20.820 --> 02:36:23.020
because my understanding is in the past,

02:36:23.020 --> 02:36:25.060
and we've been able to get to a place

02:36:26.220 --> 02:36:29.660
where we've explored growth models for quite a long time.

02:36:29.660 --> 02:36:33.380
And I believe we did that under our prior contract with ETS.

02:36:33.380 --> 02:36:37.700
So I'd just like to have Mao or Rachel comment on that,

02:36:37.700 --> 02:36:41.020
whether that's part of the proposal going forward.

02:36:41.020 --> 02:36:42.740
That's my first question.

02:36:42.740 --> 02:36:44.660
The second one is more to your,

02:36:44.660 --> 02:36:47.180
I think, second bucket, Linda,

02:36:47.180 --> 02:36:51.660
that I'll just state my preferred option here,

02:36:51.660 --> 02:36:54.660
that I think that as a state policymaking body,

02:36:54.660 --> 02:36:57.300
we should do everything possible

02:36:57.300 --> 02:37:01.140
to ease the burden of LEAs related to assessment

02:37:01.140 --> 02:37:04.340
in a time when those LEAs are seriously,

02:37:04.340 --> 02:37:07.060
or those assessments are seriously in question

02:37:07.980 --> 02:37:11.700
related to validity and reliability and comparability.

02:37:11.700 --> 02:37:14.620
So I hope that we can explore any option

02:37:14.620 --> 02:37:16.700
that is available to us,

02:37:16.700 --> 02:37:19.300
while at the same time encouraging LEAs

02:37:19.300 --> 02:37:21.100
to use local assessments,

02:37:21.100 --> 02:37:23.820
just as Mao did on one of her slides,

02:37:23.820 --> 02:37:26.660
for purposes of determining students' needs

02:37:26.660 --> 02:37:29.420
and helping to guide instruction.

02:37:29.420 --> 02:37:31.260
So I'd just like to suggest,

02:37:31.260 --> 02:37:33.580
and for your consideration, especially Linda,

02:37:33.580 --> 02:37:38.580
that we get on record as the state policymaking body

02:37:39.220 --> 02:37:41.740
that, I don't want to overstate this,

02:37:41.740 --> 02:37:42.820
but I sort of feel this way,

02:37:42.820 --> 02:37:45.180
that it would be education malpractice

02:37:45.180 --> 02:37:50.180
to require LEAs to provide results of assessments

02:37:51.140 --> 02:37:53.820
that really are seriously in jeopardy

02:37:53.820 --> 02:37:55.820
of being valid as we go forward.

02:37:55.820 --> 02:37:59.220
And I understand that we're changing federal administrations,

02:37:59.220 --> 02:38:00.700
but I think it's really important

02:38:00.700 --> 02:38:02.540
to make a very strong statement

02:38:02.540 --> 02:38:05.100
about how we feel about that.

02:38:05.100 --> 02:38:06.540
Thank you.

02:38:06.540 --> 02:38:08.180
Thank you.

02:38:08.180 --> 02:38:10.580
Next I have member Rucker.

02:38:12.500 --> 02:38:13.780
Thank you very much.

02:38:13.780 --> 02:38:16.060
I'm glad that we had the opportunity

02:38:16.060 --> 02:38:17.900
to have this conversation today.

02:38:18.740 --> 02:38:22.740
Mao, I appreciate always when we get to this assessment item

02:38:22.740 --> 02:38:25.620
because I do learn a lot from your team

02:38:25.620 --> 02:38:27.580
and from your presentation.

02:38:27.580 --> 02:38:30.700
And I do have a couple of questions.

02:38:30.700 --> 02:38:33.780
First, I just want to just do a reality check.

02:38:33.780 --> 02:38:36.900
With this start of the new calendar year,

02:38:36.900 --> 02:38:39.700
is it, am I correct in my belief

02:38:39.700 --> 02:38:41.900
that there are a number of school districts

02:38:41.900 --> 02:38:45.260
that are going to soon be entering their assessment window

02:38:45.260 --> 02:38:46.340
or that the assessment window

02:38:46.340 --> 02:38:49.060
has actually opened up at this moment?

02:38:49.060 --> 02:38:50.300
That's right.

02:38:50.300 --> 02:38:53.300
And let me just, the question of assessment window,

02:38:53.300 --> 02:38:54.980
if I could just make the point

02:38:54.980 --> 02:38:59.220
that our statewide assessment window goes until July 15th,

02:39:00.220 --> 02:39:04.460
but right now is within the formal school year

02:39:04.460 --> 02:39:06.580
of any given district.

02:39:06.580 --> 02:39:10.300
Some schools do go on a year round schedule.

02:39:10.300 --> 02:39:12.420
One of the things we can also be thinking about

02:39:12.420 --> 02:39:14.140
is extending the timeline.

02:39:15.460 --> 02:39:17.420
So just to go ahead with that thought,

02:39:17.420 --> 02:39:18.540
go ahead, member Rucker.

02:39:18.540 --> 02:39:20.260
And you actually read my mind

02:39:20.260 --> 02:39:22.820
that was going to be something I was going to ask about,

02:39:22.820 --> 02:39:27.220
especially given the information that was presented

02:39:27.220 --> 02:39:29.900
concerning some of the technology challenges,

02:39:29.900 --> 02:39:34.300
it might be worthwhile to consider doing that extension.

02:39:34.300 --> 02:39:36.420
I had the opportunity to listen in

02:39:36.420 --> 02:39:39.820
on a couple of different school board meetings

02:39:39.820 --> 02:39:41.980
that were cast virtually

02:39:41.980 --> 02:39:44.900
as we're doing our state board meeting.

02:39:44.900 --> 02:39:47.300
And some of them did raise concerns

02:39:47.300 --> 02:39:49.860
both by their assessment coordinators,

02:39:49.860 --> 02:39:52.380
but also by their district EL coordinators,

02:39:52.380 --> 02:39:54.540
that there really are some problems

02:39:54.540 --> 02:39:56.940
with the LPAC technology.

02:39:57.580 --> 02:40:01.180
And some districts actually do need to update their systems

02:40:01.180 --> 02:40:03.620
and their iPads as was pointed out

02:40:03.620 --> 02:40:06.180
by the speaker from Californians together.

02:40:06.180 --> 02:40:08.900
And that's some of those logistical nuts and bolts

02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:11.340
that are going to take time to figure out

02:40:11.340 --> 02:40:13.980
that's going to interfere with the timelines

02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:15.100
that they're up against.

02:40:15.100 --> 02:40:17.420
So I think that's something worth considering.

02:40:17.420 --> 02:40:19.140
And I don't believe that's actually something

02:40:19.140 --> 02:40:22.100
that requires action from the board to do,

02:40:22.100 --> 02:40:24.980
but rather work the department can undertake

02:40:25.020 --> 02:40:27.820
in the work that they're doing with districts already.

02:40:27.820 --> 02:40:32.820
So I would just like to ask you to consider how to do that.

02:40:32.860 --> 02:40:36.460
And then to the point that Dr. Darling-Hammond made

02:40:36.460 --> 02:40:38.260
in her opening remarks,

02:40:38.260 --> 02:40:41.100
that we need to take this opportunity

02:40:41.100 --> 02:40:43.140
that we're in in the midst of this pandemic

02:40:43.140 --> 02:40:45.020
and in the midst of looking at the work

02:40:45.020 --> 02:40:46.980
that schools are attempting to do.

02:40:46.980 --> 02:40:48.700
I think there's an opportunity

02:40:48.700 --> 02:40:53.540
that's probably being missed in our conversations

02:40:53.540 --> 02:40:56.980
about accountability, about assessment and testing

02:40:56.980 --> 02:40:58.900
in the COVID era.

02:40:58.900 --> 02:41:01.460
While it's important for us to think about the term

02:41:01.460 --> 02:41:03.820
and the concerns about learning loss,

02:41:03.820 --> 02:41:07.420
I think the message frame can be improved

02:41:07.420 --> 02:41:09.380
not only to think about learning loss

02:41:09.380 --> 02:41:11.060
or disengaged students,

02:41:11.060 --> 02:41:14.900
but also to think about what are the indicators

02:41:14.900 --> 02:41:19.220
of accountability that we need to be rethinking about

02:41:19.220 --> 02:41:20.620
or reframing.

02:41:20.620 --> 02:41:22.660
Because we understand the achievement gap

02:41:22.660 --> 02:41:25.340
and the purpose of our statewide assessments

02:41:25.340 --> 02:41:28.220
for documenting the performance of students

02:41:28.220 --> 02:41:30.300
on getting to those targeted goals.

02:41:30.300 --> 02:41:33.380
I really appreciated when we talked

02:41:33.380 --> 02:41:35.740
about the distance learning guide,

02:41:35.740 --> 02:41:38.740
when the English language arts frame was presented

02:41:38.740 --> 02:41:42.780
and those targeted goals were identified.

02:41:42.780 --> 02:41:44.700
The COVID era has really pointed out

02:41:44.700 --> 02:41:47.500
that there's more to look at and talk about

02:41:47.500 --> 02:41:51.340
in this COVID era than just thinking

02:41:51.340 --> 02:41:54.540
about the disparities in achievement

02:41:54.540 --> 02:41:56.300
among students subgroups.

02:41:56.300 --> 02:41:58.740
I think this is an opportunity for us to take a look

02:41:58.740 --> 02:42:02.780
at what else our accountability dashboard is telling us

02:42:02.780 --> 02:42:04.900
in the indicators about disparities

02:42:04.900 --> 02:42:08.060
beyond disparities in academic readiness.

02:42:08.060 --> 02:42:12.220
Because we can also get information about engagement

02:42:12.220 --> 02:42:15.740
in what's told to us about attendance and absenteeism.

02:42:15.740 --> 02:42:18.660
You get information about the performance of students

02:42:18.660 --> 02:42:21.180
in their coursework and what those disparities are,

02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:24.020
the success they're having in gaining access

02:42:24.020 --> 02:42:27.380
to their classes and using the technology successfully

02:42:27.380 --> 02:42:30.500
and accumulating credits, whether the credits are graded

02:42:30.500 --> 02:42:33.460
or not graded, the disparities in the performance

02:42:33.460 --> 02:42:35.980
on teacher made or course assessments.

02:42:35.980 --> 02:42:39.340
We have to think about also what are the disparities

02:42:39.340 --> 02:42:42.140
in access and enrollment to coursework?

02:42:42.140 --> 02:42:44.380
That's the reason why I made the point

02:42:44.380 --> 02:42:48.020
that the focus of the guidance on English language arts

02:42:48.020 --> 02:42:51.740
and math often means particularly for students of color

02:42:51.740 --> 02:42:55.260
that there's a loss of focus for the balance of curriculum.

02:42:55.260 --> 02:42:57.620
So there's an opportunity for us to also look

02:42:57.620 --> 02:43:01.980
at accountability in regard to disparities and access.

02:43:01.980 --> 02:43:04.180
So if we had take this opportunity to think about

02:43:04.180 --> 02:43:07.500
what we're looking for as we go forward to implement

02:43:07.500 --> 02:43:09.420
and think about our accountability system,

02:43:09.420 --> 02:43:11.700
whether there's a waiver or not,

02:43:11.700 --> 02:43:14.700
there's an opportunity to expand or reframe

02:43:14.700 --> 02:43:17.180
the conversation about accountability

02:43:17.180 --> 02:43:20.100
to look at the other indicators of achievement

02:43:20.100 --> 02:43:23.260
as well as the other indicators of gaps in performance,

02:43:23.260 --> 02:43:27.380
particularly to put the focus on what the root causes

02:43:27.380 --> 02:43:30.220
of those disparities are and to try to look at ways

02:43:30.220 --> 02:43:31.740
to document that.

02:43:31.740 --> 02:43:32.900
Thank you.

02:43:32.900 --> 02:43:33.860
Thank you.

02:43:33.860 --> 02:43:37.700
I'll just note I've been leading the transition team

02:43:37.700 --> 02:43:40.420
and one of the, for president-elect Biden

02:43:40.420 --> 02:43:43.620
and one of the opportunities is to hear from a lot of groups

02:43:43.620 --> 02:43:45.060
and what you just said,

02:43:45.100 --> 02:43:47.780
member Rucker has come up quite a bit.

02:43:47.780 --> 02:43:50.140
How do we think about accountability also

02:43:50.140 --> 02:43:54.540
in terms of opportunity to learn resources available?

02:43:54.540 --> 02:43:59.260
So I would just echo that that's been an important theme.

02:43:59.260 --> 02:44:02.020
I have on my list, I have member Strauss,

02:44:02.020 --> 02:44:04.660
member Rodriguez, member Patio Brownson,

02:44:04.660 --> 02:44:07.620
member Glover Woods, member Sun and member Navo.

02:44:07.620 --> 02:44:09.540
If you haven't heard your name called,

02:44:09.540 --> 02:44:11.500
that might be two of you, I think,

02:44:11.500 --> 02:44:13.020
feel free to raise your hand.

02:44:14.020 --> 02:44:16.260
Next is member Strauss.

02:44:18.900 --> 02:44:20.940
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

02:44:20.940 --> 02:44:23.140
So first, Deputy Superintendent Mays,

02:44:23.140 --> 02:44:25.100
thank you so much for setting the context

02:44:25.100 --> 02:44:27.220
of what we are talking about today

02:44:27.220 --> 02:44:30.980
and to be clear about the challenges that students

02:44:30.980 --> 02:44:33.220
and teachers and leaders are facing

02:44:33.220 --> 02:44:35.420
in these really unprecedented times.

02:44:35.420 --> 02:44:38.740
In LA County right now, every minute,

02:44:38.740 --> 02:44:42.060
10 people are identified positive for COVID-19

02:44:42.060 --> 02:44:44.300
and every eight minutes we're losing somebody.

02:44:44.300 --> 02:44:46.660
These are terrible, terrible times

02:44:46.660 --> 02:44:49.100
and I think as member Patio Brownson said,

02:44:49.100 --> 02:44:53.140
it's not likely that we're gonna be back anytime soon

02:44:53.140 --> 02:44:54.740
until these numbers go down

02:44:54.740 --> 02:44:57.940
and until things are safe for students and for teachers.

02:44:57.940 --> 02:45:01.580
And so the likelihood of looking at remote assessment

02:45:01.580 --> 02:45:05.180
is a reality under this current guidelines

02:45:05.180 --> 02:45:08.380
and I just wanna say to Dr. Vang,

02:45:08.380 --> 02:45:11.140
I think you and your team did an amazing job

02:45:11.140 --> 02:45:15.100
exploring all the issues around remote assessment

02:45:15.100 --> 02:45:18.140
and as you bring up issues of parents signing affidavits,

02:45:18.140 --> 02:45:22.380
a browser's not being secure of the number of students

02:45:22.380 --> 02:45:24.460
that have to be assessed and then overall,

02:45:24.460 --> 02:45:26.660
the reality of whether these assessments

02:45:26.660 --> 02:45:29.180
will be valid and reliable at all anyway,

02:45:29.180 --> 02:45:30.940
the chance of us getting to 95%

02:45:30.940 --> 02:45:33.820
are the current guidelines is completely unrealistic.

02:45:33.820 --> 02:45:35.020
So when I think about that,

02:45:35.020 --> 02:45:36.580
I think about districts who had to do

02:45:36.580 --> 02:45:40.140
a learning continuity plan right away, they had to do it.

02:45:40.140 --> 02:45:42.140
They had to identify how they were gonna look

02:45:42.140 --> 02:45:45.020
at students learning loss and what they were gonna do

02:45:45.020 --> 02:45:48.140
to remediate and intervene to support students.

02:45:48.140 --> 02:45:51.100
So districts are doing that using local assessments,

02:45:51.100 --> 02:45:53.780
some are using our interim assessments

02:45:53.780 --> 02:45:56.740
but right now we know which students are not connected

02:45:56.740 --> 02:45:59.100
and which students are struggling.

02:45:59.100 --> 02:46:02.860
So this assessment is not likely to give us that information,

02:46:02.860 --> 02:46:05.380
any valid reliable information.

02:46:05.380 --> 02:46:09.980
So I just wanna say I support the three goals for stage three,

02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:12.700
I think we need to continue to develop

02:46:12.700 --> 02:46:17.060
a variety of assessment options within our assessment system

02:46:17.060 --> 02:46:19.780
and I actually think we need to continue

02:46:19.780 --> 02:46:22.460
to encourage the use for the interim assessments

02:46:22.460 --> 02:46:25.940
which are aligned to our state standards and our guidelines.

02:46:25.940 --> 02:46:28.540
To me, that's a really important tool

02:46:28.540 --> 02:46:32.060
and to continue to improve the system

02:46:32.060 --> 02:46:33.940
within multiple administration modes

02:46:33.940 --> 02:46:35.740
and to continue to look at technology

02:46:35.740 --> 02:46:38.220
which we're gonna have to look at in the future

02:46:38.220 --> 02:46:42.180
as we hopefully redesign how we deliver education.

02:46:42.180 --> 02:46:45.380
But when I think about what the challenges

02:46:45.380 --> 02:46:46.820
are going forward, let me say,

02:46:46.820 --> 02:46:49.100
while I support these goals for stage three

02:46:49.100 --> 02:46:51.500
which is the only item right now,

02:46:51.500 --> 02:46:55.940
I believe we as a Board must signal as member Burr said,

02:46:55.940 --> 02:47:00.260
that we want to go forward with a waiver given options

02:47:00.260 --> 02:47:04.900
as the administration begins to change after January 20th.

02:47:04.900 --> 02:47:09.300
And I think the issue is around when we assess,

02:47:09.300 --> 02:47:13.540
how we assess the percentage of participation

02:47:13.540 --> 02:47:16.140
but the reality is for this spring,

02:47:16.140 --> 02:47:18.180
I would rather see district continue

02:47:18.180 --> 02:47:20.060
with their learning continuity plan,

02:47:20.060 --> 02:47:22.220
continue with the assessments they're using

02:47:22.220 --> 02:47:25.340
and provide intervention for students who are struggling.

02:47:25.340 --> 02:47:28.580
I appreciate the governor's proposal

02:47:28.580 --> 02:47:31.380
for additional extended school year and additional time

02:47:31.380 --> 02:47:33.580
which we know we're going to need.

02:47:33.580 --> 02:47:35.860
But I don't think that we're going to have

02:47:35.860 --> 02:47:39.580
other than an exercise of futility.

02:47:39.580 --> 02:47:42.340
And this, I don't think spring administration

02:47:42.340 --> 02:47:45.100
with remote learning is going to be an effective tool

02:47:45.100 --> 02:47:46.940
other than in frustration.

02:47:46.940 --> 02:47:49.420
And I believe as a Board, we should guide

02:47:49.420 --> 02:47:51.460
and support the work we're doing now

02:47:51.460 --> 02:47:56.140
and look once we're back in person learning,

02:47:56.140 --> 02:47:58.340
first connecting with students social emotionally

02:47:58.340 --> 02:47:59.460
and reconnecting with them,

02:47:59.460 --> 02:48:01.300
they haven't been in school in a year

02:48:01.300 --> 02:48:02.980
and then to think about assessment.

02:48:02.980 --> 02:48:05.820
So I would support the goals for this item

02:48:05.820 --> 02:48:08.460
but I would also support when possible

02:48:08.460 --> 02:48:12.420
a future discussion and motion to pursue a waiver

02:48:12.420 --> 02:48:15.900
at the federal level for the spring assessment process.

02:48:15.900 --> 02:48:17.100
Thank you.

02:48:17.100 --> 02:48:17.940
Thank you.

02:48:18.780 --> 02:48:20.700
Next I have member Rodriguez.

02:48:21.980 --> 02:48:23.740
Thank you, good morning.

02:48:23.740 --> 02:48:27.340
And I would like to echo what has just been said

02:48:27.340 --> 02:48:30.380
exactly in those words assessments.

02:48:31.340 --> 02:48:35.260
You know, I believe for information

02:48:35.260 --> 02:48:37.060
and right now a lot of the information

02:48:37.060 --> 02:48:38.860
that we already know is that

02:48:40.020 --> 02:48:41.900
our students are experiencing loss

02:48:41.900 --> 02:48:46.900
for the reasons that member Rucker mentioned, right?

02:48:46.900 --> 02:48:50.260
A lot of it is socioeconomic and access.

02:48:51.140 --> 02:48:52.900
The information that we could garner

02:48:52.900 --> 02:48:55.820
from any assessments that are given,

02:48:55.820 --> 02:48:57.820
whether it's at a district level

02:48:58.700 --> 02:49:01.580
would be about how we can intervene

02:49:01.580 --> 02:49:03.540
and support our students

02:49:04.540 --> 02:49:06.540
now that we're learning digitally

02:49:06.540 --> 02:49:08.860
or when we're back in person.

02:49:08.860 --> 02:49:11.940
As of this morning, Imperial County where I'm seated

02:49:14.860 --> 02:49:18.660
has a 39% COVID positivity rate.

02:49:18.660 --> 02:49:22.220
And you know, it's a very small county

02:49:22.220 --> 02:49:26.100
but the numbers are very similar to Los Angeles County.

02:49:26.140 --> 02:49:31.140
And so we're having a devastating effect on our students,

02:49:32.540 --> 02:49:35.940
our students' social and emotional wellbeing.

02:49:35.940 --> 02:49:38.660
And teachers in my district in particular

02:49:38.660 --> 02:49:41.300
have reached out to me about this item

02:49:41.300 --> 02:49:46.300
because they are concerned like many members of CTA,

02:49:48.140 --> 02:49:49.900
many teachers in the classroom

02:49:50.860 --> 02:49:54.060
about the administration of the test

02:49:54.060 --> 02:49:57.340
and the effect that it would have on our students.

02:49:59.700 --> 02:50:03.980
And I have said, if we can get information that we can use

02:50:03.980 --> 02:50:06.380
so that we can support our students

02:50:06.380 --> 02:50:08.100
when we're back in the classroom,

02:50:08.100 --> 02:50:10.220
then that would be wonderful.

02:50:10.220 --> 02:50:13.700
But like everybody else, I'm in support of a waiver

02:50:15.900 --> 02:50:17.380
in pursuing that route.

02:50:17.380 --> 02:50:21.500
And then of course, if we don't get the waiver

02:50:21.500 --> 02:50:23.660
to make sure that the assessment results

02:50:24.260 --> 02:50:26.940
are used for information, perhaps for funding

02:50:26.940 --> 02:50:29.100
so that we can support our students

02:50:29.100 --> 02:50:31.740
once we return to class.

02:50:34.860 --> 02:50:38.260
And I also spoke to students and I asked them

02:50:38.260 --> 02:50:40.100
what they thought about testing

02:50:40.100 --> 02:50:44.260
and the thought was just so overwhelming to them.

02:50:44.260 --> 02:50:47.980
So, hearing from a lot of our different stakeholders,

02:50:47.980 --> 02:50:49.820
people have reached out to me

02:50:49.860 --> 02:50:54.860
and I've contacted colleagues that I feel comfortable

02:50:55.660 --> 02:50:58.780
getting the honest truth from them.

02:50:58.780 --> 02:51:02.140
So that's one thing on the testing.

02:51:03.420 --> 02:51:06.820
Again, I'll just reiterate that I'm in support

02:51:06.820 --> 02:51:09.300
of a waiver from the federal government

02:51:09.300 --> 02:51:10.340
if that can happen.

02:51:12.300 --> 02:51:15.700
And then with regard to the second bucket

02:51:15.700 --> 02:51:18.300
or which may have been the first bucket,

02:51:18.300 --> 02:51:22.140
I want to also acknowledge Kaltog's letter

02:51:22.140 --> 02:51:27.020
and some of the comments made regarding the CSA

02:51:27.020 --> 02:51:29.940
and how much I would like as a person

02:51:29.940 --> 02:51:31.980
who's bilingual and biliterate

02:51:31.980 --> 02:51:36.980
and completely support these efforts for the CSA

02:51:37.540 --> 02:51:40.180
to make sure that when we contract with somebody

02:51:40.180 --> 02:51:43.940
who will be creating the new contractor

02:51:43.940 --> 02:51:45.420
for these assessments,

02:51:45.420 --> 02:51:48.820
that there are the constructed response writing items

02:51:49.900 --> 02:51:54.900
and that it mirrors the English language arts assessment.

02:51:55.900 --> 02:51:57.940
I think that's something that's very important

02:51:57.940 --> 02:52:00.220
for us to move forward with.

02:52:00.220 --> 02:52:01.500
Thank you.

02:52:01.500 --> 02:52:02.700
Thank you.

02:52:02.700 --> 02:52:04.020
Member Patia Bronson.

02:52:06.180 --> 02:52:11.180
I also want to join in thanks to Dr. Vang and Dr. Maves

02:52:12.100 --> 02:52:14.460
for providing the context

02:52:14.500 --> 02:52:15.700
and also some of the updates

02:52:15.700 --> 02:52:17.820
as to what some of the training opportunities

02:52:17.820 --> 02:52:21.780
and resources that have been made available online

02:52:21.780 --> 02:52:26.780
and through virtual formats to help people get up to speed

02:52:26.860 --> 02:52:29.940
with remote testing procedures,

02:52:29.940 --> 02:52:33.220
which as board member Strauss was saying,

02:52:33.220 --> 02:52:37.660
I think is a very, very much the highest likelihood

02:52:37.660 --> 02:52:41.860
of what would happen certainly in LA County in the future,

02:52:41.860 --> 02:52:44.660
but many other counties that are in the purple right now.

02:52:45.780 --> 02:52:49.380
I am really, I think,

02:52:50.700 --> 02:52:55.700
struck by the data that we saw

02:52:55.900 --> 02:52:59.260
from some of the parent polls in the fall.

02:52:59.260 --> 02:53:03.620
And I'm thinking of the Ed Trust West poll of parents

02:53:03.620 --> 02:53:05.100
around the state.

02:53:05.100 --> 02:53:09.220
And it's more than two thirds of students' parents

02:53:09.220 --> 02:53:12.300
around the state that are saying

02:53:12.300 --> 02:53:14.900
that they still want the data

02:53:14.900 --> 02:53:17.300
about how their children are performing.

02:53:17.300 --> 02:53:21.380
And also wanting to know whether their kids

02:53:21.380 --> 02:53:25.860
are meeting the expectations that we have set out for them.

02:53:25.860 --> 02:53:27.740
I don't think that has changed.

02:53:28.660 --> 02:53:31.180
And although there are stressors,

02:53:31.180 --> 02:53:36.060
there are also mechanisms by which some of this testing

02:53:36.060 --> 02:53:40.620
actually can be very centering and focusing for students.

02:53:40.620 --> 02:53:43.900
We heard a lot of accounts here in Los Angeles

02:53:43.900 --> 02:53:48.900
around the idea that when there was guaranteed grades

02:53:49.540 --> 02:53:51.300
to be held harmless,

02:53:51.300 --> 02:53:53.620
a lot of students were less motivated

02:53:53.620 --> 02:53:55.900
and were not as focused on it.

02:53:55.900 --> 02:54:00.900
And as the return to grades in the more normal format

02:54:01.900 --> 02:54:05.580
came back, students actually focused in a different way.

02:54:06.900 --> 02:54:11.140
I think some of the comments around this idea

02:54:11.140 --> 02:54:13.780
that we already know that there's learning loss,

02:54:13.780 --> 02:54:16.340
I think it is true.

02:54:16.340 --> 02:54:20.620
And what the specter of testing offers

02:54:20.620 --> 02:54:23.940
is to give us a much clearer view

02:54:23.940 --> 02:54:28.940
of the degree to which learning loss is not consistent.

02:54:29.940 --> 02:54:31.900
It is not uniform.

02:54:31.900 --> 02:54:34.660
And to know where it is most acute

02:54:34.660 --> 02:54:38.740
and be able to have the capacity to pinpoint that

02:54:38.740 --> 02:54:40.100
and address it in the future,

02:54:40.100 --> 02:54:44.940
I think is a valuable tool that we should not give up on.

02:54:44.940 --> 02:54:49.420
I'm also, I think, encouraged to hear about the potential

02:54:49.420 --> 02:54:52.060
for an extended testing timeline

02:54:52.060 --> 02:54:54.780
as we're looking at the July 15th timeframe.

02:54:54.820 --> 02:54:58.460
And if the state budget goes forward

02:54:58.460 --> 02:55:00.700
with this idea of an extended school year,

02:55:00.700 --> 02:55:04.180
that also creates additional flexibility

02:55:04.180 --> 02:55:07.340
to be able to make sure that

02:55:07.340 --> 02:55:11.620
we're not making any sweeping generalizations

02:55:11.620 --> 02:55:14.380
about the degree to which learning loss is uniform

02:55:14.380 --> 02:55:17.100
and a California-wide problem,

02:55:17.100 --> 02:55:18.940
and also sweeping up the carpet,

02:55:18.940 --> 02:55:22.140
the degree to which it's much more acute

02:55:22.140 --> 02:55:24.180
in some neighborhoods, in some schools,

02:55:24.180 --> 02:55:26.460
in some communities, and our policymakers

02:55:26.460 --> 02:55:28.580
need to know that exactly

02:55:28.580 --> 02:55:31.580
in order to actually be able to solve for it in the future.

02:55:33.500 --> 02:55:34.340
Thank you.

02:55:35.300 --> 02:55:36.420
Member Glover-Woods.

02:55:38.340 --> 02:55:39.660
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond,

02:55:39.660 --> 02:55:42.060
and I'll be very succinct in my comments.

02:55:42.060 --> 02:55:44.020
I agree with all of the comments

02:55:44.020 --> 02:55:46.900
that have been made by my fellow Board members.

02:55:46.900 --> 02:55:50.060
First, in regards to the item that's in front of us

02:55:50.060 --> 02:55:53.860
for action, I do support those proposed goals

02:55:53.860 --> 02:55:55.300
that have been outlined.

02:55:55.300 --> 02:56:00.140
I would just encourage that as exploration is being done,

02:56:00.140 --> 02:56:04.780
that we make sure that we are emphasizing

02:56:04.780 --> 02:56:07.900
really the further development of all aspects

02:56:07.900 --> 02:56:10.540
of our California assessment system,

02:56:10.540 --> 02:56:13.620
inclusive of our California Spanish assessment,

02:56:13.620 --> 02:56:18.620
to ensure that there is the same robust type of information

02:56:18.620 --> 02:56:21.340
and opportunities for students to perform their knowledge

02:56:21.340 --> 02:56:25.140
on that assessment as is on some of the others.

02:56:25.140 --> 02:56:29.660
As it relates to test administration for the spring,

02:56:29.660 --> 02:56:32.500
I can, again, just say ditto, ditto, ditto.

02:56:32.500 --> 02:56:37.020
I'm in full support of moving forward for a waiver

02:56:37.020 --> 02:56:39.660
when it is the time to do so.

02:56:39.660 --> 02:56:44.020
The reality in the field is that bringing students back

02:56:44.020 --> 02:56:47.140
on campus in many of our districts across the state

02:56:47.140 --> 02:56:50.020
is just not a doable thing.

02:56:50.020 --> 02:56:52.300
We've already heard a lot of the issues

02:56:52.300 --> 02:56:56.700
around trying to deliver the assessment remotely.

02:56:56.700 --> 02:56:58.860
That could be an opportunity for some,

02:56:58.860 --> 02:57:03.860
but again, might be extremely challenging in other areas.

02:57:03.940 --> 02:57:07.700
So what I would, again, strongly encourage us to do

02:57:07.700 --> 02:57:10.620
is to seek a waiver and to look at,

02:57:10.620 --> 02:57:13.500
as some of the Board members have mentioned,

02:57:13.500 --> 02:57:16.860
other ways that accountability can be looked at,

02:57:16.860 --> 02:57:18.740
other indicators of learning

02:57:18.740 --> 02:57:21.860
and also other indicators that will help us know

02:57:21.860 --> 02:57:25.620
exactly where the gaps are and to be able to communicate

02:57:25.620 --> 02:57:29.620
that to the parents and families that need the information.

02:57:29.620 --> 02:57:34.180
So really working with districts or charters

02:57:34.180 --> 02:57:36.820
at the local level so that, again,

02:57:36.820 --> 02:57:40.100
we're able to communicate and they are able to communicate

02:57:40.100 --> 02:57:42.900
to their families and to their students

02:57:42.900 --> 02:57:46.580
how students have performed and where they are

02:57:46.580 --> 02:57:48.220
at the end of this year,

02:57:48.220 --> 02:57:51.500
so that there is a clear starting place

02:57:51.500 --> 02:57:54.700
for the new school year.

02:57:57.900 --> 02:57:58.740
Thank you.

02:57:59.620 --> 02:58:02.180
Member Sun.

02:58:03.460 --> 02:58:04.900
Thank you.

02:58:04.900 --> 02:58:06.180
Yeah, I'm going to be parroting

02:58:06.180 --> 02:58:08.060
some of what my colleagues have said.

02:58:08.060 --> 02:58:11.980
I agree it would be untenable to administer

02:58:11.980 --> 02:58:15.380
a statewide assessment this spring,

02:58:15.380 --> 02:58:19.820
irrespective of all the reliability questions that we have.

02:58:19.820 --> 02:58:22.900
So I would also support seeking a waiver

02:58:22.900 --> 02:58:26.780
when and if that option comes before us.

02:58:27.900 --> 02:58:29.820
At the same time, I have to tell you,

02:58:29.820 --> 02:58:34.420
I feel a sense that I feel like it would be irresponsible

02:58:34.420 --> 02:58:39.420
of us not to have some sort of a baseline,

02:58:41.060 --> 02:58:43.780
a sense of how our students are doing

02:58:43.780 --> 02:58:48.020
coming out of this pandemic and going into next year.

02:58:48.020 --> 02:58:53.020
And inspired by the words of President Darling-Hammond,

02:58:53.260 --> 02:58:54.940
at the beginning of this meeting

02:58:54.940 --> 02:58:57.540
about how we can look at things differently,

02:58:57.540 --> 02:58:59.140
I wonder if there may be a way

02:58:59.140 --> 02:59:01.780
that we do some kind of administration

02:59:01.780 --> 02:59:06.780
without accountability and just to get a sense of baseline

02:59:07.780 --> 02:59:10.540
in the fall of the next school year.

02:59:10.540 --> 02:59:13.260
And if that might be something that we can be worked in

02:59:13.260 --> 02:59:15.940
where we have some consistency.

02:59:15.940 --> 02:59:18.540
And while I know we have the interim assessments

02:59:18.540 --> 02:59:21.660
and we have the schools and districts

02:59:21.660 --> 02:59:25.620
are using local assessments for these diagnostics,

02:59:25.620 --> 02:59:28.980
I feel that we have a responsibility to get a pulse,

02:59:28.980 --> 02:59:33.100
statewide pulse on what is happening with learning

02:59:34.100 --> 02:59:37.380
and where students are right now.

02:59:37.380 --> 02:59:40.220
And so, and I can't imagine us not waiting

02:59:40.220 --> 02:59:43.220
until the following spring, until spring of next year.

02:59:44.220 --> 02:59:47.500
So looking at being creative,

02:59:47.500 --> 02:59:49.620
not always just doing things that we've always had,

02:59:49.620 --> 02:59:53.100
we've never done any kind of a baseline in a fall,

02:59:53.100 --> 02:59:56.620
but perhaps that might be something we want to consider

02:59:56.620 --> 02:59:58.060
and look into or explore.

02:59:58.060 --> 03:00:00.020
Thank you, thank you.

03:00:00.020 --> 03:00:00.860
Member Navarro.

03:00:04.180 --> 03:00:08.060
Yeah, I just appreciate my fellow board members

03:00:08.060 --> 03:00:09.660
and their thoughtful comments.

03:00:09.660 --> 03:00:11.940
And to the extent that I can offer something

03:00:11.940 --> 03:00:14.780
for food for thought here, I will.

03:00:14.780 --> 03:00:18.580
On the first item, Mal and Rachel,

03:00:18.580 --> 03:00:21.060
I really appreciate the hard work that you have done.

03:00:21.060 --> 03:00:24.660
And I agree with our fellow comments

03:00:24.660 --> 03:00:27.460
around the growth model and the CSA opportunities

03:00:27.460 --> 03:00:29.580
should they be at the extent that they exist.

03:00:29.580 --> 03:00:32.260
I think those might be very beneficial to pursue.

03:00:33.260 --> 03:00:36.140
On the second item, regarding whether or not we test

03:00:36.140 --> 03:00:37.420
to the extent we're talking about something

03:00:37.420 --> 03:00:38.780
we actually can control here,

03:00:39.740 --> 03:00:42.020
it seems to me that it's one of three options.

03:00:43.220 --> 03:00:46.940
One is you request the waiver and you go without tests

03:00:46.940 --> 03:00:49.700
and you have run the risk of the Ed saying no,

03:00:49.700 --> 03:00:52.740
at which point districts will hold back,

03:00:52.740 --> 03:00:53.740
hoping for the waiver.

03:00:54.700 --> 03:00:58.460
Option two, to the extent that we can get some flexibilities

03:00:58.460 --> 03:01:02.940
around testing things like the 95% participation rate,

03:01:02.940 --> 03:01:07.220
because I think we were assuming that to a large degree

03:01:07.220 --> 03:01:08.940
that parents are gonna come into this.

03:01:08.940 --> 03:01:11.180
And I know we've heard that there are a lot of parents

03:01:11.180 --> 03:01:14.260
that do anticipate and desire this.

03:01:14.260 --> 03:01:17.740
I think there's a lot of parents that won't be willing

03:01:17.740 --> 03:01:20.340
to add the stress level to the remote learning

03:01:20.340 --> 03:01:21.540
that has already existed.

03:01:22.540 --> 03:01:23.780
To the extent that we can extend

03:01:23.780 --> 03:01:26.620
the performance task window would be helpful.

03:01:28.540 --> 03:01:30.620
And we've done this before.

03:01:30.620 --> 03:01:33.700
When we transitioned from state standards to Common Core,

03:01:33.700 --> 03:01:35.580
we actually went two years without testing it.

03:01:35.580 --> 03:01:38.180
And we relied on local achievement data

03:01:38.180 --> 03:01:40.700
and we have asked our districts to identify

03:01:40.700 --> 03:01:42.820
those local assessments in their LCPs.

03:01:43.740 --> 03:01:48.060
So the extent that we give them one year of hiatus

03:01:48.060 --> 03:01:50.140
under unprecedented times to me,

03:01:51.660 --> 03:01:56.060
the wheels aren't gonna fall off when we did it before,

03:01:56.820 --> 03:01:59.340
certainly under different circumstances.

03:01:59.340 --> 03:02:01.620
But we have asked local educators in the past

03:02:01.620 --> 03:02:04.220
to go without testing results

03:02:04.220 --> 03:02:06.500
and to rely on local assessments

03:02:06.500 --> 03:02:09.100
to determine the needs of their students.

03:02:09.100 --> 03:02:12.020
And the third option is we grin and bear it,

03:02:12.020 --> 03:02:14.500
the reality that we have to test.

03:02:14.500 --> 03:02:17.060
And we ask local educators to do the best they can.

03:02:18.140 --> 03:02:23.140
My preference and my opinion is that we rely on option one.

03:02:23.380 --> 03:02:25.180
I don't think we have a choice.

03:02:25.180 --> 03:02:27.300
I don't think we can say in one breath,

03:02:27.300 --> 03:02:28.980
there's a pandemic and juniors,

03:02:28.980 --> 03:02:32.100
you can't come in and take your PSAT.

03:02:32.100 --> 03:02:33.220
And in the same breath,

03:02:33.220 --> 03:02:35.380
encourage them to come and take their aspect.

03:02:37.100 --> 03:02:38.620
I don't think that we have a choice

03:02:38.620 --> 03:02:42.900
other than to demonstrate that we were gonna walk the talk

03:02:43.980 --> 03:02:46.340
and that has been the priority of safety

03:02:47.420 --> 03:02:48.580
of students and staff.

03:02:49.700 --> 03:02:54.420
And so I think we have to prioritize the waiver request

03:02:54.420 --> 03:02:56.940
and to the extent that we can get anything,

03:02:56.940 --> 03:02:58.460
minimally flexibility,

03:02:58.460 --> 03:03:01.420
because I am sensitive to the districts like San Diego

03:03:01.420 --> 03:03:03.820
and there are others who are well-equipped

03:03:03.820 --> 03:03:06.620
and able to use the assessment to gain results.

03:03:08.460 --> 03:03:09.980
Thank you.

03:03:09.980 --> 03:03:13.980
Okay, I see member Fatah has raised his hand.

03:03:13.980 --> 03:03:16.020
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

03:03:16.020 --> 03:03:19.860
And I'd just like to take a moment to thank Dr. Vang

03:03:19.860 --> 03:03:21.860
and the team for exploring all the issues

03:03:21.860 --> 03:03:24.180
and ideas that you mentioned in your presentation.

03:03:24.180 --> 03:03:26.940
And I'd also like to take the moment to really echo

03:03:26.940 --> 03:03:31.060
and place emphasis on the words of my colleagues,

03:03:31.060 --> 03:03:33.380
board members Navo and Sun.

03:03:33.380 --> 03:03:38.020
I think that they really share a valuable perspective

03:03:38.020 --> 03:03:40.860
when they say that, particularly board member Navo,

03:03:40.860 --> 03:03:45.540
when he just brought up that we were kind of telling juniors

03:03:45.540 --> 03:03:50.540
to, I guess, stand by, not take the PSAT.

03:03:51.020 --> 03:03:52.860
And so now we're gonna kind of encourage them

03:03:52.860 --> 03:03:55.060
to come in and take state testing.

03:03:55.060 --> 03:03:59.500
And I also am starting to really recognize the problem

03:03:59.500 --> 03:04:01.500
with the fact that we're jeopardizing

03:04:01.500 --> 03:04:05.700
the legitimacy of the exam if we were to deliver it remotely.

03:04:05.700 --> 03:04:07.900
And I'm also the problem that kind of arises

03:04:07.900 --> 03:04:11.500
when we bring students on campus to take the testing

03:04:11.500 --> 03:04:13.020
because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

03:04:13.020 --> 03:04:15.660
So I just like to say that I share the same sentiments

03:04:15.660 --> 03:04:17.340
as board members Strauss

03:04:17.340 --> 03:04:19.900
and numerous of my other fellow board members.

03:04:19.900 --> 03:04:22.700
And I support the three goals before us,

03:04:22.700 --> 03:04:24.740
but I also support the federal waiver

03:04:24.740 --> 03:04:26.860
for the spring assessments.

03:04:26.860 --> 03:04:29.620
And I really like the idea

03:04:29.620 --> 03:04:31.980
that board member Sun just brought up

03:04:31.980 --> 03:04:33.660
that because of the learning loss

03:04:33.660 --> 03:04:36.980
and the fact that we risk a lot of learning loss,

03:04:36.980 --> 03:04:38.980
it would be kind of a nice idea for us

03:04:38.980 --> 03:04:40.300
to get a heartbeat in the fall

03:04:40.300 --> 03:04:43.860
and see where we're kind of out in terms of learning loss

03:04:43.860 --> 03:04:46.980
by doing some kind of assessment of some sort.

03:04:46.980 --> 03:04:49.460
So that's my perspective.

03:04:49.460 --> 03:04:50.700
Thank you.

03:04:50.700 --> 03:04:52.380
Appreciate that.

03:04:52.380 --> 03:04:55.420
Member McQuillin, did you wanna add your two cents

03:04:56.420 --> 03:04:59.780
to the conversation?

03:04:59.780 --> 03:05:02.860
You're the only one we have not yet heard from.

03:05:02.860 --> 03:05:05.260
Last but not least, thank you for asking.

03:05:06.580 --> 03:05:10.700
I appreciate all the work from the staff on this item also.

03:05:10.700 --> 03:05:12.580
It is very complicated.

03:05:12.580 --> 03:05:16.460
And thinking through all the comments

03:05:16.460 --> 03:05:20.180
and I echo a lot of what's been said.

03:05:21.340 --> 03:05:24.180
I think of all our North State counties

03:05:24.260 --> 03:05:25.900
who are struggling right now

03:05:25.900 --> 03:05:30.900
and the disparity in devices and connectivity.

03:05:32.140 --> 03:05:36.340
And we have so many students that are missing in action

03:05:36.340 --> 03:05:40.340
up here in the North State who are missing school,

03:05:40.340 --> 03:05:42.540
a large attendance problem.

03:05:43.540 --> 03:05:46.340
So when I think of assessments this spring,

03:05:46.340 --> 03:05:49.980
anything we can do to offer flexibility for our districts

03:05:49.980 --> 03:05:54.660
and LEAs in terms of extending the year

03:05:54.660 --> 03:05:59.660
or extending the window of assessment, those are all great.

03:06:00.020 --> 03:06:03.100
And I would support the idea of a waiver also

03:06:03.100 --> 03:06:05.260
if that comes to be.

03:06:05.260 --> 03:06:07.740
So thank you all for the comments and the work.

03:06:08.860 --> 03:06:10.500
Thank you.

03:06:10.500 --> 03:06:11.580
Thank you.

03:06:11.580 --> 03:06:14.620
I'm gonna take a moment to sort of sum up

03:06:14.620 --> 03:06:17.900
and see if we can move towards our motion.

03:06:18.860 --> 03:06:22.340
What I hear in common across the board

03:06:22.340 --> 03:06:27.340
is a concern for safety and a concern for focusing

03:06:27.620 --> 03:06:30.900
on student needs and knowing what our students

03:06:30.900 --> 03:06:32.460
know and can do.

03:06:32.460 --> 03:06:35.780
Even if that means we rely on formative

03:06:35.780 --> 03:06:38.420
and diagnostic tools in some cases

03:06:38.420 --> 03:06:42.580
or move the assessment window out further

03:06:42.580 --> 03:06:46.660
such that we actually wait till it's safe

03:06:47.540 --> 03:06:50.260
to have students in school and bring them back

03:06:50.260 --> 03:06:52.540
perhaps even in the fall.

03:06:52.540 --> 03:06:56.020
There are some states that, and I think of Connecticut

03:06:56.020 --> 03:06:59.220
where our incoming secretaries from used to do

03:06:59.220 --> 03:07:01.860
their assessments in the fall for the purpose

03:07:01.860 --> 03:07:06.420
of knowing how kids are doing before the full year begins.

03:07:06.420 --> 03:07:11.420
So there are ways to think about the options

03:07:11.660 --> 03:07:13.740
both in terms of the nature of the assessments.

03:07:13.740 --> 03:07:15.860
We did ask in our continuity plans

03:07:15.860 --> 03:07:19.220
for everyone to do diagnostic or formative assessments

03:07:19.220 --> 03:07:21.660
and that may give the information to parents

03:07:21.660 --> 03:07:26.540
and district and teachers that helps them move forward.

03:07:26.540 --> 03:07:29.260
It's actually the only way we can measure learning loss

03:07:29.260 --> 03:07:30.420
right now because we didn't give

03:07:30.420 --> 03:07:32.100
the summative assessment last year.

03:07:32.100 --> 03:07:35.340
So the summative assessment won't tell us much

03:07:35.340 --> 03:07:39.300
about learning loss, formative and diagnostic tools may.

03:07:39.300 --> 03:07:41.060
So we may need to think flexibly

03:07:41.060 --> 03:07:45.060
about the kinds of assessment while wanting to focus

03:07:45.060 --> 03:07:47.460
on student needs and safety at the same time.

03:07:47.460 --> 03:07:48.780
We may need to think flexibly

03:07:48.780 --> 03:07:51.620
about the timelines for assessment.

03:07:53.260 --> 03:07:58.260
And I hear a resounding view that we should be cognizant

03:07:59.300 --> 03:08:04.300
of the situation that we're in right now

03:08:04.420 --> 03:08:09.220
and the high levels of COVID rates

03:08:09.220 --> 03:08:14.180
in many parts of the state and be mindful

03:08:14.180 --> 03:08:18.300
that we not conduct business as usual in this context

03:08:18.300 --> 03:08:20.220
even while we're looking at flexibilities

03:08:20.220 --> 03:08:24.740
that may allow us to know how our students are doing.

03:08:25.700 --> 03:08:27.860
And so I think we're gonna have to take stock

03:08:27.860 --> 03:08:32.860
of all of that and what the incoming administration invites

03:08:33.660 --> 03:08:35.220
in terms of waivers.

03:08:35.220 --> 03:08:37.140
There is already an invitation

03:08:37.140 --> 03:08:42.140
to disconnect accountability decisions for CSI and TSA

03:08:44.660 --> 03:08:49.260
from any assessments of the current administration

03:08:49.260 --> 03:08:54.260
has made that clear that that's a requestable waiver.

03:08:54.580 --> 03:08:57.060
So I hear a lot of support for that

03:08:57.060 --> 03:09:00.620
and then we will see what the other possibilities may be.

03:09:02.620 --> 03:09:05.620
And so I want to now focus us on the item

03:09:05.620 --> 03:09:07.900
that we need to vote on.

03:09:07.900 --> 03:09:11.540
What we need to vote on is the CDE recommendation

03:09:11.580 --> 03:09:15.460
that's still up on Director Vang's slide

03:09:15.460 --> 03:09:17.820
around the Enhancing the Development

03:09:17.820 --> 03:09:20.140
and Administration of High Quality Assessments,

03:09:21.140 --> 03:09:22.820
some of the Interim Informative,

03:09:22.820 --> 03:09:25.300
Improve the Robust Assessment System

03:09:25.300 --> 03:09:28.180
and Explore and Advance Technology Solutions.

03:09:28.180 --> 03:09:30.580
I think we heard a lot of statements

03:09:30.580 --> 03:09:33.900
about how the board's view of improving assessments

03:09:33.900 --> 03:09:38.100
includes performance tests and instructor response items

03:09:38.980 --> 03:09:43.140
that really give a sense of how kids are thinking

03:09:43.140 --> 03:09:47.980
and performing and includes following the work

03:09:47.980 --> 03:09:50.700
that we're doing to get at things like big ideas

03:09:50.700 --> 03:09:52.100
and mathematics and so on.

03:09:52.100 --> 03:09:55.580
So I think we got a sense of the board's views

03:09:55.580 --> 03:09:58.860
about what improvement might consist of.

03:09:58.860 --> 03:10:03.420
Do we have a motion for the recommendations?

03:10:04.420 --> 03:10:09.420
I'm happy to move the CDE's recommendation

03:10:09.500 --> 03:10:13.460
on the proposed goals and priorities for stage three.

03:10:13.460 --> 03:10:15.660
All right, and do we have a second?

03:10:15.660 --> 03:10:16.660
Second.

03:10:16.660 --> 03:10:18.580
Thank you very much.

03:10:18.580 --> 03:10:20.180
Is there any further discussion?

03:10:21.300 --> 03:10:23.860
All right, I think we need to take a roll call vote.

03:10:23.860 --> 03:10:25.660
Brooks, can you call our roll?

03:10:26.580 --> 03:10:27.460
Number son.

03:10:28.780 --> 03:10:29.620
Aye.

03:10:30.420 --> 03:10:32.300
Vice President Strauss.

03:10:32.300 --> 03:10:33.700
Aye.

03:10:33.700 --> 03:10:34.540
Member Rucker.

03:10:35.380 --> 03:10:36.700
Yes, absolutely.

03:10:37.700 --> 03:10:38.780
Member Rodriguez.

03:10:40.300 --> 03:10:41.700
Yes.

03:10:41.700 --> 03:10:42.900
Member Patil Brownson.

03:10:43.940 --> 03:10:45.180
Yes.

03:10:45.180 --> 03:10:46.740
Member Navo.

03:10:46.740 --> 03:10:48.140
Yes.

03:10:48.140 --> 03:10:49.100
Member McQuillan.

03:10:50.580 --> 03:10:51.700
Yes.

03:10:51.700 --> 03:10:52.900
Member Glover Woods.

03:10:54.380 --> 03:10:55.740
Yes.

03:10:55.740 --> 03:10:57.460
Member Fatah.

03:10:57.460 --> 03:10:58.700
Yes.

03:10:58.700 --> 03:11:00.620
President Darling-Hammond.

03:11:00.620 --> 03:11:01.740
Yes.

03:11:02.180 --> 03:11:03.460
Member Burr.

03:11:03.460 --> 03:11:04.300
Aye.

03:11:05.220 --> 03:11:06.780
The motion passes unanimously.

03:11:08.260 --> 03:11:11.860
Thank you, and thank you, Mao, for all of the good work,

03:11:11.860 --> 03:11:14.180
the good presentation, and for your stamina.

03:11:15.940 --> 03:11:18.580
And coming up on the noon hours.

03:11:18.580 --> 03:11:23.140
So I think what we ought to do is take our break for lunch

03:11:23.140 --> 03:11:25.020
from now till 1230.

03:11:25.020 --> 03:11:28.100
I will let you know that we are a little behind

03:11:28.100 --> 03:11:30.060
where we thought we might be at this point,

03:11:30.060 --> 03:11:33.100
so we're going to try to be very efficient this afternoon

03:11:33.100 --> 03:11:36.100
so we can catch up toward our goal.

03:11:36.100 --> 03:11:36.980
All right, very good.

03:11:36.980 --> 03:11:38.460
We'll see you back at 1230.

03:11:38.460 --> 03:11:41.540
Please turn your microphone and your camera off,

03:11:41.540 --> 03:11:45.940
but do not leave the room, the virtual room.

03:11:45.940 --> 03:11:47.620
You can leave your actual room.

03:11:48.500 --> 03:11:49.340
Thank you.

03:11:55.500 --> 03:11:56.860
Thank you.

03:11:56.860 --> 03:11:58.340
We are up to item four.

03:11:58.380 --> 03:12:00.780
Item four is the update to the California

03:12:00.780 --> 03:12:03.620
Every Student Succeeds Act state plan,

03:12:03.620 --> 03:12:05.660
approval of amendments to the state plan

03:12:05.660 --> 03:12:07.780
and COVID-19 state plan addendum

03:12:07.780 --> 03:12:10.500
to the U.S. Department of Education.

03:12:10.500 --> 03:12:13.180
The CDE recommends that we approve the amendments

03:12:13.180 --> 03:12:15.740
to the consolidated state plan

03:12:15.740 --> 03:12:18.420
and COVID-19 state plan addendum for submission

03:12:18.420 --> 03:12:20.740
to the Department of Education,

03:12:20.740 --> 03:12:22.940
pending the State Board of Education

03:12:22.940 --> 03:12:26.180
Executive Director approval of final revisions

03:12:26.180 --> 03:12:30.220
requested by SBE and correction of any typographical errors

03:12:30.220 --> 03:12:32.100
or non-substantive clarifying edits,

03:12:32.100 --> 03:12:34.580
and the item will be presented by Joe Sines

03:12:34.580 --> 03:12:37.620
and Cindy Kazanis of the CDE.

03:12:37.620 --> 03:12:40.820
So Joe and Cindy, please begin.

03:12:42.420 --> 03:12:44.020
Thank you so much.

03:12:44.020 --> 03:12:46.260
Good afternoon, State Board members.

03:12:46.260 --> 03:12:48.900
My name is Joe Sines, for those of you who don't know me,

03:12:48.900 --> 03:12:50.940
and I'm the Federal Policy Liaison

03:12:50.940 --> 03:12:53.380
for the California Department of Education.

03:12:54.260 --> 03:12:56.060
Today, myself, along with Cindy Kazanis,

03:12:56.060 --> 03:12:57.740
Director of the Analysis, Measurement,

03:12:57.740 --> 03:13:00.020
and Accountability Reporting Division,

03:13:00.020 --> 03:13:01.420
will be presenting item four,

03:13:01.420 --> 03:13:02.980
the update to the California's

03:13:02.980 --> 03:13:05.180
Every Student Succeeds Act state plan,

03:13:05.180 --> 03:13:07.420
approval of the amendments to the state plan,

03:13:07.420 --> 03:13:09.580
and COVID-19 state plan addendum

03:13:09.580 --> 03:13:11.540
to the U.S. Department of Education.

03:13:12.540 --> 03:13:13.620
Next slide, please.

03:13:17.620 --> 03:13:19.820
And the topics we will be covering

03:13:19.820 --> 03:13:21.860
in our presentation today

03:13:21.860 --> 03:13:23.900
will be in order to provide background

03:13:23.900 --> 03:13:25.620
on the Every Student Succeeds Act,

03:13:26.140 --> 03:13:27.140
also known as the ESSA,

03:13:27.140 --> 03:13:28.820
and update you on the amendment status

03:13:28.820 --> 03:13:31.780
of California's consolidated state plan.

03:13:31.780 --> 03:13:33.820
Also, we will be covering proposed amendments

03:13:33.820 --> 03:13:35.420
to the state plan.

03:13:35.420 --> 03:13:37.580
And lastly, this presentation will update the group

03:13:37.580 --> 03:13:42.340
on the 2020-21 school year COVID-19 state plan addendum

03:13:42.340 --> 03:13:45.900
that has been offered by the U.S. Department of Education.

03:13:45.900 --> 03:13:47.220
Next slide, please.

03:13:49.980 --> 03:13:52.260
The CDE recommends that the State Board

03:13:52.260 --> 03:13:54.020
approve the amendments to California's

03:13:54.260 --> 03:13:55.700
ESSA consolidated state plan

03:13:55.700 --> 03:13:57.700
and COVID-19 state plan addendum

03:13:57.700 --> 03:14:01.300
for submission to the U.S. Department of Education.

03:14:01.300 --> 03:14:02.140
This would be pending

03:14:02.140 --> 03:14:04.300
the SBE Executive Director approval

03:14:04.300 --> 03:14:06.980
of final revisions requested by the State Board,

03:14:06.980 --> 03:14:09.540
correction of any typographical errors,

03:14:09.540 --> 03:14:13.580
and necessary non-substantive clarifying edits.

03:14:13.580 --> 03:14:16.620
I'd also like to recognize that the last item

03:14:16.620 --> 03:14:17.820
had a robust discussion

03:14:17.820 --> 03:14:20.380
regarding the waiving of assessments.

03:14:20.380 --> 03:14:22.820
This item doesn't really contemplate that.

03:14:23.660 --> 03:14:25.940
We look to the direction of the State Board

03:14:25.940 --> 03:14:29.020
and the superintendent for any issues

03:14:29.020 --> 03:14:31.660
relating to that discussion.

03:14:31.660 --> 03:14:32.780
Next slide, please.

03:14:35.060 --> 03:14:37.620
Now we'll go through the ESSA and updates

03:14:37.620 --> 03:14:39.700
on the status of the latest amendments.

03:14:40.860 --> 03:14:41.980
Next slide, please.

03:14:43.580 --> 03:14:46.700
So as many of you know, give you some background.

03:14:46.700 --> 03:14:49.380
The ESSA was signed into law by President Barack Obama

03:14:49.380 --> 03:14:51.540
in December 2015.

03:14:51.580 --> 03:14:53.700
It was a reauthorization of the Elementary

03:14:53.700 --> 03:14:57.140
and Secondary Education Act, or ESEA.

03:14:57.140 --> 03:14:59.660
It replaces the No Child Left Behind Act.

03:14:59.660 --> 03:15:02.380
It ensures educational equity and opportunity

03:15:02.380 --> 03:15:04.980
for disadvantaged and high-need students,

03:15:04.980 --> 03:15:07.980
and it's access supplement to state programs.

03:15:09.220 --> 03:15:10.220
Next slide, please.

03:15:16.180 --> 03:15:18.500
In January of 2020, the State Board approved

03:15:18.500 --> 03:15:20.220
the adoption of the following amendments

03:15:20.220 --> 03:15:21.620
to the ESSA State Plan,

03:15:21.620 --> 03:15:24.260
which reflect the Board's action in 2019

03:15:24.260 --> 03:15:26.940
and technical edits to the plan.

03:15:26.940 --> 03:15:30.660
This includes the following, updating the long-term goal

03:15:30.660 --> 03:15:32.060
and revised status cut scores

03:15:32.060 --> 03:15:34.580
for the graduation rate indicator,

03:15:34.580 --> 03:15:36.900
approve the methodology for using

03:15:36.900 --> 03:15:39.980
the English Learner Progress Indicator, or LP,

03:15:39.980 --> 03:15:41.540
for school identification.

03:15:42.420 --> 03:15:43.460
Next slide, please.

03:15:46.060 --> 03:15:49.180
Additionally, it approved status cut scores for the LP,

03:15:49.180 --> 03:15:51.980
clarified the definitions of ineffective teacher

03:15:51.980 --> 03:15:53.900
and out-of-field teacher,

03:15:53.900 --> 03:15:58.220
it raised the low graduation threshold to below 68%,

03:15:58.220 --> 03:16:01.300
it refined a combined, also known as an extended rate,

03:16:01.300 --> 03:16:03.340
four- and five-year graduation rate

03:16:03.340 --> 03:16:06.020
for the graduation rate indicator,

03:16:06.020 --> 03:16:09.740
and reinserted the academic indicator state-level data

03:16:09.740 --> 03:16:11.140
by student group tables.

03:16:15.780 --> 03:16:18.380
So now I will pass the presentation to Cindy

03:16:18.380 --> 03:16:21.300
to talk more about the State Plan amendments and timeline.

03:16:27.700 --> 03:16:28.540
Thanks, Joe.

03:16:31.780 --> 03:16:35.300
So the next slide is good news.

03:16:35.300 --> 03:16:37.620
We were approved for all of the items

03:16:37.620 --> 03:16:40.700
that Joe discovered on December 4th

03:16:40.700 --> 03:16:44.700
as we were preparing this board item for your consideration.

03:16:44.700 --> 03:16:46.940
Additionally, in that letter,

03:16:46.940 --> 03:16:50.820
the U.S. Department of Education approved additional time

03:16:50.820 --> 03:16:54.940
for the CDE to provide data related to educator equity

03:16:55.940 --> 03:16:58.980
for California's ESSA Consolidated State Plan.

03:16:58.980 --> 03:17:01.500
That data is due to the U.S. Department of Education

03:17:01.500 --> 03:17:04.260
by March of 2021.

03:17:04.260 --> 03:17:09.260
And just as an aside, the CDE continues to work actively

03:17:09.260 --> 03:17:14.260
with our partners and our CalPAT staff internally

03:17:15.260 --> 03:17:19.100
for the collection of this data as we currently speak.

03:17:19.100 --> 03:17:22.300
So in doing that, we are actually providing

03:17:22.300 --> 03:17:24.580
technical assistance very actively to the field,

03:17:24.580 --> 03:17:26.540
and there's been an enormous response.

03:17:26.540 --> 03:17:30.660
We've had or plan to have over 4,000 participants

03:17:30.660 --> 03:17:34.260
in technical assistance webinars around this data collection

03:17:34.260 --> 03:17:35.260
for the current school year.

03:17:35.260 --> 03:17:39.580
So many hats off to Barbara Murchison and her staff,

03:17:39.580 --> 03:17:43.060
as well as Jerry Winkler and his team in the CalPATs

03:17:43.260 --> 03:17:48.260
off in the field to make sure that this data collection

03:17:49.340 --> 03:17:52.220
continues to be robust and of high quality.

03:17:59.060 --> 03:18:01.340
Additionally, we received a letter

03:18:01.340 --> 03:18:05.020
from the U.S. Department of Education back in October,

03:18:05.020 --> 03:18:09.060
going backwards, which is unrelated to the amendments

03:18:09.060 --> 03:18:12.860
that were approved, but rather really delved

03:18:13.660 --> 03:18:15.140
into our dashboard alternative school status.

03:18:15.140 --> 03:18:18.100
And you all heard a lot about that program

03:18:18.100 --> 03:18:20.340
this past board meeting in November,

03:18:20.340 --> 03:18:22.060
where we had some robust conversations

03:18:22.060 --> 03:18:27.020
about the value added that we've done in California

03:18:27.020 --> 03:18:28.300
for our accountability system

03:18:28.300 --> 03:18:30.060
for our most high-need students,

03:18:30.060 --> 03:18:32.020
our alternative school students.

03:18:32.020 --> 03:18:34.940
What the U.S. Department of Education told California

03:18:34.940 --> 03:18:37.940
was that that program or that we're using

03:18:37.940 --> 03:18:42.420
to calculate state indicators

03:18:42.420 --> 03:18:44.420
for the dashboard alternative school status.

03:18:44.420 --> 03:18:46.860
Schools is not permissible under ESSA,

03:18:46.860 --> 03:18:49.900
and that we cannot establish different cut scores

03:18:49.900 --> 03:18:51.020
for the academic indicator

03:18:51.020 --> 03:18:53.420
or use a one-year graduation rate.

03:18:53.420 --> 03:18:55.260
We've asked for additional time,

03:18:55.260 --> 03:18:56.220
and the next couple of slides,

03:18:56.220 --> 03:18:57.740
I'm gonna walk you through the amendments

03:18:57.740 --> 03:18:58.780
that we're proposing.

03:19:01.540 --> 03:19:06.340
So there are four different attachments to this item.

03:19:06.340 --> 03:19:09.980
The first attachment and the third attachment

03:19:09.980 --> 03:19:12.420
relate to the ESSA Consolidated State Plan

03:19:12.420 --> 03:19:14.140
proposed amendments.

03:19:14.140 --> 03:19:18.740
So specifically, as you saw in the abbreviated version

03:19:18.740 --> 03:19:20.980
for attachment one for the dashboard alternative

03:19:20.980 --> 03:19:22.580
school status, we are asking for permission

03:19:22.580 --> 03:19:24.020
to use this indicator.

03:19:24.020 --> 03:19:26.740
We have not in the past formally placed this

03:19:26.740 --> 03:19:28.580
in our ESSA state plan,

03:19:28.580 --> 03:19:31.740
and so this now puts it in the ESSA state plan.

03:19:31.740 --> 03:19:35.620
We also are asking not only

03:19:35.660 --> 03:19:37.580
for the academic indicator modified methods

03:19:37.580 --> 03:19:38.420
to be approved,

03:19:38.420 --> 03:19:40.140
but the graduation rate indicator

03:19:41.740 --> 03:19:43.940
modified methods to be approved as well.

03:19:43.940 --> 03:19:46.380
So you'll see those edits in attachment three

03:19:46.380 --> 03:19:48.500
in that 166 page document

03:19:48.500 --> 03:19:52.620
that we have to place and track changes

03:19:52.620 --> 03:19:54.700
to send to the US Department of Education

03:19:54.700 --> 03:19:56.580
as the amendments are submitted.

03:19:59.060 --> 03:20:00.820
Additionally, as you're gonna hear

03:20:00.820 --> 03:20:01.900
in the next couple of slides

03:20:01.900 --> 03:20:05.100
about the COVID state plan addendum,

03:20:05.100 --> 03:20:08.740
we are required which we are moving forward with

03:20:08.740 --> 03:20:12.500
and asking for relief from identification of schools.

03:20:12.500 --> 03:20:15.220
This piece, unlike the other piece

03:20:15.220 --> 03:20:16.060
that you're gonna hear about

03:20:16.060 --> 03:20:18.020
related to the college crew indicator

03:20:18.020 --> 03:20:20.620
has to be updated or you have to submit

03:20:20.620 --> 03:20:22.620
an updated state plan to them.

03:20:22.620 --> 03:20:26.940
So we are trying to sort of deal with both issues at once

03:20:26.940 --> 03:20:29.820
and in doing the amendment to the state plan,

03:20:29.820 --> 03:20:31.500
you'll also see the language in there

03:20:31.500 --> 03:20:34.620
that describes our timeline changes

03:20:34.620 --> 03:20:35.580
for school identification

03:20:35.580 --> 03:20:38.620
as part of that COVID-19 state plan addendum process.

03:20:40.060 --> 03:20:42.860
And with that, I'm gonna turn it back over to Joe.

03:20:44.460 --> 03:20:46.460
Oh, sorry, this is still my part.

03:20:47.500 --> 03:20:49.220
So in working, walking through,

03:20:52.580 --> 03:20:54.860
actually, Joe, you're picking this up, right?

03:20:55.780 --> 03:20:56.860
Yeah, I got.

03:20:56.860 --> 03:20:57.700
Sorry about that.

03:20:57.700 --> 03:20:58.520
Thank you, Cindy.

03:20:59.500 --> 03:21:00.940
The next part of this item will cover

03:21:00.940 --> 03:21:05.940
the 2020-21 school year COVID-19 state plan addendum.

03:21:06.060 --> 03:21:07.020
Next slide, please.

03:21:10.500 --> 03:21:12.740
So as you know, in March of 2020,

03:21:12.740 --> 03:21:14.860
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,

03:21:14.860 --> 03:21:17.660
ED invited states to request a streamlined assessment

03:21:17.660 --> 03:21:19.460
and accountability waiver.

03:21:19.460 --> 03:21:20.580
Through this, states would not need

03:21:20.580 --> 03:21:23.140
to administer statewide assessments to all students

03:21:23.140 --> 03:21:25.940
to make annual accountability determinations

03:21:25.940 --> 03:21:28.420
to identify schools for support and improvement

03:21:29.340 --> 03:21:32.300
or to provide data on a state and local report cards

03:21:32.300 --> 03:21:35.220
for assessment and accountability information.

03:21:35.220 --> 03:21:37.380
We worked to get this submitted.

03:21:37.380 --> 03:21:41.420
So on March 26, Superintendent Thurmond

03:21:41.420 --> 03:21:43.340
and State Board President Darling-Hammond

03:21:43.340 --> 03:21:47.060
submitted on behalf of the CDE and SBE

03:21:47.060 --> 03:21:49.100
the assessment and accountability waiver.

03:21:50.300 --> 03:21:52.980
This was also approved retroactively

03:21:52.980 --> 03:21:57.020
by the State Board on May 7th, 2020.

03:21:58.820 --> 03:22:03.460
And I think we just lost Cindy.

03:22:03.460 --> 03:22:06.340
So just a moment.

03:22:12.060 --> 03:22:13.740
No worries, I can.

03:22:13.740 --> 03:22:15.940
Alex, do you have the PowerPoint by chance?

03:22:17.860 --> 03:22:18.700
Thank you.

03:22:20.660 --> 03:22:21.620
Okay, perfect.

03:22:23.020 --> 03:22:28.020
So in response to the COVID-19 waivers approved in March,

03:22:28.460 --> 03:22:31.660
U.S. Department of Education in October of 2020

03:22:31.660 --> 03:22:34.100
released information to provide responses

03:22:34.100 --> 03:22:36.740
to questions state education agencies,

03:22:36.740 --> 03:22:39.900
local education agencies and schools may have

03:22:39.900 --> 03:22:43.580
regarding implementation of the COVID-19 waivers

03:22:43.580 --> 03:22:46.540
and the impact of COVID-19 on accountability systems

03:22:46.540 --> 03:22:50.380
for the 2020-21 school year.

03:22:50.380 --> 03:22:51.540
Next slide, please.

03:22:53.460 --> 03:22:56.380
So as found in the attachment,

03:22:56.380 --> 03:22:59.140
specifically U.S. Department of Education

03:22:59.140 --> 03:23:03.140
posted the following documents related to COVID-19 waivers

03:23:03.140 --> 03:23:06.540
on the ED Consolidated State Plans webpage.

03:23:09.780 --> 03:23:14.300
This was the State Plan Addendum template for 2020-2021

03:23:14.300 --> 03:23:19.300
and also a draft of FAQs titled Impact of COVID-19

03:23:19.300 --> 03:23:23.420
on Accountability System required under the ESEA.

03:23:23.420 --> 03:23:26.460
So the deadline for this State Plan Addendum

03:23:26.460 --> 03:23:29.780
is February 1st, 2021.

03:23:38.580 --> 03:23:42.860
And so I think this was, let me see real quickly,

03:23:42.860 --> 03:23:44.340
this was Cindy's part actually.

03:23:44.340 --> 03:23:47.260
So let me just, as anyone,

03:23:47.260 --> 03:23:49.660
did she get in touch with you, Alex, by chance?

03:23:54.140 --> 03:23:57.140
She is having technology problems at her house

03:23:57.140 --> 03:23:59.260
and they're trying to fix those.

03:23:59.260 --> 03:24:00.180
Okay.

03:24:00.180 --> 03:24:01.860
But we've read the item.

03:24:01.860 --> 03:24:04.740
And so if you wanna just kind of walk us through the slides,

03:24:04.740 --> 03:24:05.580
I think that would be-

03:24:05.580 --> 03:24:06.420
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

03:24:06.420 --> 03:24:07.240
I can do that.

03:24:07.240 --> 03:24:08.500
I just wanted to give her a chance.

03:24:08.500 --> 03:24:11.300
You know, these technology-

03:24:11.300 --> 03:24:12.900
She pops back in.

03:24:12.900 --> 03:24:15.500
Yeah, I was less worried about her following off

03:24:15.500 --> 03:24:17.420
than my dog barking or something like that.

03:24:17.420 --> 03:24:18.780
So I can keep going.

03:24:20.180 --> 03:24:21.940
So the revisions to the State Plan

03:24:21.940 --> 03:24:25.100
that can be submitted through the streamlined COVID process.

03:24:25.100 --> 03:24:28.100
So the state indicators that are impacted

03:24:28.100 --> 03:24:30.460
by not having this data

03:24:30.460 --> 03:24:32.340
will only impact the Accountability System

03:24:32.340 --> 03:24:34.780
for the 2020-21 school year

03:24:34.780 --> 03:24:36.820
and or accountability terminations

03:24:36.820 --> 03:24:40.380
and or school identifications in fall of 2021.

03:24:41.260 --> 03:24:43.460
So we do intend to submit this

03:24:43.460 --> 03:24:45.320
for the College Career Indicator.

03:24:46.220 --> 03:24:47.220
So it's important to note too,

03:24:47.220 --> 03:24:49.860
we're only taking advantage of a portion

03:24:49.860 --> 03:24:53.020
of this addendum.

03:24:53.020 --> 03:24:54.140
Next slide, please.

03:24:57.100 --> 03:24:59.420
So looking at the school dashboard

03:24:59.420 --> 03:25:01.220
and reporting of the College Career Indicator.

03:25:01.220 --> 03:25:03.380
So we recommend that the CCI

03:25:03.380 --> 03:25:06.660
not be reported on the 2021 dashboard.

03:25:06.660 --> 03:25:08.780
This is because our graduates will not have

03:25:08.780 --> 03:25:11.860
the grade 11 California Assessment

03:25:11.860 --> 03:25:14.300
of Student Performance and Progress

03:25:14.300 --> 03:25:17.620
results due to the suspension of testing in March of 2020.

03:25:18.620 --> 03:25:20.700
One of the key measures of the CCI.

03:25:21.980 --> 03:25:24.780
Since all indicators are equally weighted in the dashboard,

03:25:24.780 --> 03:25:28.780
no other changes are proposed as a result.

03:25:28.780 --> 03:25:30.260
And this is a one-time change

03:25:30.260 --> 03:25:33.220
and only applies for the 2021 school year.

03:25:34.500 --> 03:25:37.020
And I think Cindy might be back.

03:25:37.020 --> 03:25:37.860
Hello.

03:25:39.780 --> 03:25:41.340
Just to add a couple of notes

03:25:41.340 --> 03:25:43.980
to what I think Jess already covered.

03:25:43.980 --> 03:25:45.340
For the College Career Indicator,

03:25:45.340 --> 03:25:47.100
while we may not be able to,

03:25:48.300 --> 03:25:49.780
let me turn on the video,

03:25:49.780 --> 03:25:53.820
while we may not be able to report out on it

03:25:53.820 --> 03:25:56.700
this coming year, we are contemplating

03:25:56.700 --> 03:25:58.540
and we are committed to exploring

03:25:58.540 --> 03:26:00.700
how we can report on some of the measures

03:26:00.700 --> 03:26:03.020
that I think as Member Rucker mentioned

03:26:03.020 --> 03:26:06.140
in the prior item, that districts have been spending

03:26:06.140 --> 03:26:07.620
a lot of time investing in.

03:26:07.620 --> 03:26:10.060
Like what kind of access to courses,

03:26:10.060 --> 03:26:12.980
to completion of courses, certain courses

03:26:13.060 --> 03:26:14.780
that students have completion

03:26:14.780 --> 03:26:19.780
or successful taking of an AP exam.

03:26:19.900 --> 03:26:23.660
So those are some pieces that we're trying to get creative on

03:26:23.660 --> 03:26:27.100
in absence of being able to report out on a formal measure,

03:26:27.100 --> 03:26:29.180
being able to put on the pieces

03:26:29.180 --> 03:26:31.060
that make up that particular indicator.

03:26:31.060 --> 03:26:32.820
So I wanted to mention that piece.

03:26:35.940 --> 03:26:36.780
Next slide.

03:26:39.260 --> 03:26:42.420
So as far as the revision timeline,

03:26:42.460 --> 03:26:47.460
or rather the timeline revisions for the state plan,

03:26:47.540 --> 03:26:49.540
we are proposing to take advantage

03:26:49.540 --> 03:26:51.980
of the ability to not identify new schools

03:26:51.980 --> 03:26:55.020
for comprehensive support and improvement

03:26:55.020 --> 03:26:57.020
or additional targeted support improvement.

03:26:57.020 --> 03:26:58.900
And again, for all our states,

03:26:58.900 --> 03:27:01.060
this has been sort of on a three-year basis,

03:27:01.060 --> 03:27:03.500
but for California, we've been identifying every year

03:27:03.500 --> 03:27:07.380
because we've been deemed a high-risk state

03:27:07.380 --> 03:27:11.140
and it's been a condition of that piece on our grant.

03:27:11.140 --> 03:27:13.180
This does not contemplate

03:27:13.180 --> 03:27:15.020
or rather the streamlined labor does not provide us

03:27:15.020 --> 03:27:17.780
the option to not identify schools

03:27:17.780 --> 03:27:19.780
under targeted support and improvement.

03:27:19.780 --> 03:27:22.340
So that is something I know President Darling-Hammond

03:27:22.340 --> 03:27:24.260
mentioned was at the forefront

03:27:24.260 --> 03:27:27.420
of the new administration coming in next week

03:27:27.420 --> 03:27:30.460
to Washington, D.C. for consideration.

03:27:31.340 --> 03:27:33.020
So what this waiver would do

03:27:33.020 --> 03:27:35.060
is provide CSI schools an extra year

03:27:35.060 --> 03:27:37.620
to meet the statewide exit criteria

03:27:37.620 --> 03:27:41.100
before implementing more rigorous state-termined action

03:27:42.100 --> 03:27:44.180
as well as for ATSI schools an extra year

03:27:44.180 --> 03:27:46.780
to meet statewide exit criteria

03:27:46.780 --> 03:27:48.460
before identifying for CSI.

03:27:48.460 --> 03:27:51.020
So they'd have additional time,

03:27:51.020 --> 03:27:54.580
we'd see a freeze for those two programs

03:27:54.580 --> 03:27:56.020
for a second year in a row.

03:27:59.820 --> 03:28:02.340
Next slide, and just to further that information,

03:28:03.740 --> 03:28:08.500
the timeline then would move schools and CSI

03:28:08.500 --> 03:28:13.500
to the fall of, I don't think that's accurate.

03:28:14.340 --> 03:28:17.340
We would move schools and CSI to the fall of 2025

03:28:17.340 --> 03:28:19.820
for looking at it again.

03:28:19.820 --> 03:28:23.180
We propose that no new schools be identified for CSI

03:28:23.180 --> 03:28:27.340
or KTSI for this coming school year.

03:28:27.340 --> 03:28:30.300
So we typically identify in January,

03:28:30.300 --> 03:28:32.740
so it'd be January 2022,

03:28:32.740 --> 03:28:34.780
but I think it's helpful just to keep in mind

03:28:34.780 --> 03:28:38.780
this would be based on 2021 dashboard results,

03:28:38.780 --> 03:28:40.740
which of course we're suggesting

03:28:41.700 --> 03:28:44.660
that we be waived from that identification.

03:28:44.660 --> 03:28:47.220
And ATSI schools would be provided an extra year

03:28:47.220 --> 03:28:49.420
to meet statewide exit criteria

03:28:49.420 --> 03:28:51.260
before being identified for CSI,

03:28:51.260 --> 03:28:53.580
which was again, something in our waiver

03:28:53.580 --> 03:28:55.700
when we looked down the road about schools

03:28:55.700 --> 03:28:58.020
that continue to be in ATSI.

03:28:58.940 --> 03:29:02.020
So to summarize our recommendation on the next slide

03:29:02.900 --> 03:29:05.540
is that the State Board of Education,

03:29:09.540 --> 03:29:10.860
okay,

03:29:12.340 --> 03:29:15.260
send them for submission to the US Department of Education

03:29:15.260 --> 03:29:18.140
pending the State Board of Education Executive Director

03:29:18.140 --> 03:29:21.820
approval of final revisions requested by the FDE

03:29:21.820 --> 03:29:24.020
and corrections of any typographical errors

03:29:24.020 --> 03:29:27.020
and necessary non-substitutive clarifying edits.

03:29:27.020 --> 03:29:29.820
And with that, I think we have a slide for public comments.

03:29:32.980 --> 03:29:34.900
Excellent, thank you so much.

03:29:35.780 --> 03:29:39.300
So we will now open the phone line for public comment queue

03:29:39.300 --> 03:29:41.580
and members of the public wishing to provide comment

03:29:41.580 --> 03:29:44.580
on this item may do so by calling the phone number

03:29:44.580 --> 03:29:46.780
and using the access code shown there.

03:29:48.100 --> 03:29:50.820
And while we're waiting for members of the public to call in,

03:29:50.820 --> 03:29:54.180
I want to ask member Burr and then Vice President Strauss

03:29:54.180 --> 03:29:56.860
if they have any initial comments on this item

03:29:56.860 --> 03:29:59.780
and then we will get to public comment

03:29:59.780 --> 03:30:02.300
and then come back for board discussion.

03:30:02.300 --> 03:30:04.980
So member Burr, do you want to start us off?

03:30:05.900 --> 03:30:08.900
Sure, I don't think I have any additional comments.

03:30:08.900 --> 03:30:11.100
Both Cindy and Joe did an excellent job

03:30:11.100 --> 03:30:14.620
describing the action requested

03:30:14.620 --> 03:30:17.180
and be happy to hear public comment

03:30:17.180 --> 03:30:19.660
and then be available to make a motion as needed.

03:30:20.620 --> 03:30:22.380
All right, Vice President Strauss,

03:30:22.380 --> 03:30:24.180
do you have any framing comments?

03:30:24.180 --> 03:30:25.540
Yeah, so let me just say,

03:30:25.540 --> 03:30:28.140
I think we've worked really hard to align

03:30:28.140 --> 03:30:31.220
the federal requirements for ESSA with our state plan.

03:30:31.220 --> 03:30:34.820
And as we've done thoughtful work,

03:30:34.820 --> 03:30:37.540
sometimes ED says it doesn't quite fit.

03:30:37.540 --> 03:30:42.540
So then we ask for a waiver and we try to make the system fit

03:30:42.620 --> 03:30:44.780
and I think it really is aligned

03:30:44.780 --> 03:30:46.820
to what we identify in California

03:30:46.820 --> 03:30:49.580
and what our stakeholder input has agreed to.

03:30:50.620 --> 03:30:53.500
I agree with not identifying any new schools at this point.

03:30:53.500 --> 03:30:57.900
I don't think that's necessary based on how we identify them

03:30:58.660 --> 03:31:01.620
and then we went into remote learning pretty soon after.

03:31:01.620 --> 03:31:04.580
And I do believe that member Rucker's comments

03:31:04.580 --> 03:31:07.380
about the other components of college and career

03:31:07.380 --> 03:31:10.380
are essential to look at in addition to the state

03:31:10.380 --> 03:31:12.940
to smarter balance assessments for 11th grade.

03:31:12.940 --> 03:31:14.420
So I agree with that.

03:31:15.380 --> 03:31:20.380
And I just, again, I just support us aligning the process

03:31:20.660 --> 03:31:23.500
and then when we can asking for a waiver

03:31:23.500 --> 03:31:26.220
so that we may stay the path that we've identified

03:31:26.220 --> 03:31:28.180
and I support these recommendations.

03:31:28.180 --> 03:31:29.140
Thank you.

03:31:29.140 --> 03:31:30.540
Great.

03:31:30.540 --> 03:31:32.500
Are there any clarifying questions

03:31:32.500 --> 03:31:34.740
just about the content of what we heard?

03:31:36.780 --> 03:31:40.340
All right, let's go to public comment if we have any.

03:31:40.340 --> 03:31:41.180
Yes, we do.

03:31:41.180 --> 03:31:43.580
It looks like we have a few people in the queue.

03:31:43.580 --> 03:31:46.140
I will open the phone line up for item number four.

03:31:48.580 --> 03:31:49.420
Good afternoon.

03:31:49.420 --> 03:31:52.260
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:31:52.260 --> 03:31:53.180
You have one minute.

03:31:53.180 --> 03:31:54.980
Your time starts now.

03:31:54.980 --> 03:31:56.100
Okay, we'll broadcast.

03:31:56.100 --> 03:31:57.820
My name is Dr. Micah Studer,

03:31:57.820 --> 03:32:00.420
Executive Director of Equity and Support Services

03:32:00.420 --> 03:32:02.660
for the Yolo County Office of Education.

03:32:02.660 --> 03:32:04.460
And I come before you as a representative

03:32:04.460 --> 03:32:06.380
of the California County Superintendents

03:32:06.380 --> 03:32:09.180
Educations Association Student Programs

03:32:09.180 --> 03:32:10.860
and Services Steering Committee.

03:32:10.860 --> 03:32:13.020
We are concerned that the United States

03:32:13.020 --> 03:32:14.740
Department of Education's decision to reject

03:32:14.740 --> 03:32:17.100
California's modified methodology

03:32:17.100 --> 03:32:19.020
for alternative education programs

03:32:19.020 --> 03:32:21.700
will disproportionately harm our students.

03:32:21.700 --> 03:32:23.420
For a dashboard alternative,

03:32:23.460 --> 03:32:26.020
the status school serving students across the state,

03:32:26.020 --> 03:32:28.500
the modified method of collecting data

03:32:28.500 --> 03:32:30.380
are critical for our schools and student groups

03:32:30.380 --> 03:32:31.820
for two key reasons.

03:32:31.820 --> 03:32:34.740
Firstly, are crucial in measuring student progress.

03:32:34.740 --> 03:32:36.940
Many students in DAS schools report to our campus

03:32:36.940 --> 03:32:38.100
with significant learning loss

03:32:38.100 --> 03:32:40.380
and a desperate need of learning acceleration.

03:32:40.380 --> 03:32:43.380
With over 93% of our students being very low or low,

03:32:43.380 --> 03:32:47.180
negative students arts and 96% being very low or low in math,

03:32:47.180 --> 03:32:48.620
we need a way to more accurately measure

03:32:48.620 --> 03:32:50.460
student learning and academic progress.

03:32:50.460 --> 03:32:52.940
Second, these metrics support DAS schools

03:32:52.980 --> 03:32:55.860
in measuring school interventions and supports.

03:32:55.860 --> 03:32:57.700
Especially when examining the graduation rate,

03:32:57.700 --> 03:33:00.180
our DAS schools will be misrepresented.

03:33:00.180 --> 03:33:02.500
Educational programs for our students

03:33:02.500 --> 03:33:04.340
are individualized by design,

03:33:04.340 --> 03:33:06.420
with students typically not spending four years

03:33:06.420 --> 03:33:08.620
or more in our programs.

03:33:08.620 --> 03:33:10.780
And as such, a cohort model does not apply.

03:33:10.780 --> 03:33:12.860
In summary, we need a way to meaningfully measure,

03:33:12.860 --> 03:33:15.460
analyze, and support our DAS schools and staff

03:33:15.460 --> 03:33:17.060
by recognizing their unique charge

03:33:17.060 --> 03:33:19.580
in supporting our MOSAP Promise Students.

03:33:19.580 --> 03:33:20.400
Thank you.

03:33:20.400 --> 03:33:21.240
Thank you.

03:33:23.100 --> 03:33:23.940
Good afternoon.

03:33:23.940 --> 03:33:25.860
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:33:25.860 --> 03:33:26.700
You have one minute.

03:33:26.700 --> 03:33:27.740
Your time starts now.

03:33:28.740 --> 03:33:29.580
Thank you.

03:33:29.580 --> 03:33:32.060
Jessica Sacco on behalf of Children Now.

03:33:32.060 --> 03:33:34.540
I'm affirming our alignment with the concerns

03:33:34.540 --> 03:33:35.780
and requests that were outlined

03:33:35.780 --> 03:33:39.100
in the LCFF Equity Coalition letter on this item.

03:33:39.100 --> 03:33:41.060
One question I'm hoping the board can address

03:33:41.060 --> 03:33:44.020
is when the SLEA report cards will be released.

03:33:44.020 --> 03:33:46.580
They were due last June and still have not been released.

03:33:46.580 --> 03:33:48.780
The report cards must include for the first time

03:33:48.780 --> 03:33:50.820
data on school site per pupil expenditures

03:33:50.820 --> 03:33:54.340
and data on the distribution of under-qualified teachers.

03:33:54.340 --> 03:33:56.460
Relative to low-income and minority students

03:33:56.460 --> 03:33:58.100
being served at disproportionate rates

03:33:58.100 --> 03:33:59.620
by ineffective teachers,

03:33:59.620 --> 03:34:01.060
the reporting of that information

03:34:01.060 --> 03:34:04.140
and actions that need to take place to comply with law,

03:34:04.140 --> 03:34:06.060
Children Now encourages the board

03:34:06.060 --> 03:34:08.180
to establish objective state standards

03:34:08.180 --> 03:34:10.580
for fully credentialed and misassigned teachers

03:34:10.580 --> 03:34:14.140
and ensure LEAs publish updated teacher equity plans

03:34:14.140 --> 03:34:16.140
as part of their local ESSA obligations

03:34:16.140 --> 03:34:18.100
in which they outline the steps they will take

03:34:18.100 --> 03:34:20.300
to ensure low-income and minority students

03:34:20.300 --> 03:34:22.340
are not served at disproportionate rates

03:34:22.340 --> 03:34:23.620
by ineffective teachers.

03:34:24.940 --> 03:34:25.780
Thank you.

03:34:28.500 --> 03:34:29.340
Good afternoon.

03:34:29.340 --> 03:34:31.100
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:34:31.100 --> 03:34:31.940
You have one minute.

03:34:31.940 --> 03:34:32.980
Your time starts now.

03:34:34.660 --> 03:34:35.500
Good afternoon.

03:34:35.500 --> 03:34:38.140
It's John Athelt from Public Advocates

03:34:38.140 --> 03:34:40.900
and also on behalf of the Equity Coalition.

03:34:40.900 --> 03:34:45.540
We wanna congratulate President Darling Hammond

03:34:45.540 --> 03:34:49.700
and Vice President Strauss for your reelection today.

03:34:49.700 --> 03:34:52.500
On this day when we have a president being impeached

03:34:52.500 --> 03:34:53.380
for the second time,

03:34:53.380 --> 03:34:55.740
it's good to know we have a president in California

03:34:55.740 --> 03:34:58.900
that we can believe and believe in.

03:35:00.660 --> 03:35:04.860
The teacher equity obligation under ESSA

03:35:04.860 --> 03:35:09.860
is not just a local LEA data collection exercise.

03:35:09.940 --> 03:35:14.940
It's also incumbent on the SEA here

03:35:15.140 --> 03:35:19.260
to ensure that the local teacher equity plans

03:35:19.260 --> 03:35:20.900
are actually in good shape

03:35:20.900 --> 03:35:25.900
and working to ensure that students have equal access

03:35:26.940 --> 03:35:31.620
to effective and prepared and in-field teachers.

03:35:31.620 --> 03:35:36.620
Likewise, this state board needs to take its own actions

03:35:36.620 --> 03:35:40.220
to ensure teacher equity is being addressed

03:35:40.220 --> 03:35:44.100
and we hope to see the priority one indicator

03:35:44.100 --> 03:35:48.660
addressed this year for the December dashboard.

03:35:48.820 --> 03:35:49.660
Thank you.

03:35:49.660 --> 03:35:50.500
Teacher equity, thank you.

03:35:50.500 --> 03:35:51.320
Thank you.

03:35:53.780 --> 03:35:54.620
Good afternoon.

03:35:54.620 --> 03:35:56.500
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:35:56.500 --> 03:35:57.340
You have one minute.

03:35:57.340 --> 03:35:58.500
Your time starts now.

03:35:59.900 --> 03:36:01.260
Hi, this is Leticia Garcia

03:36:01.260 --> 03:36:04.540
on behalf of Riverside County Superintendent of Schools.

03:36:04.540 --> 03:36:06.380
We'd like to thank the board and the SPI

03:36:06.380 --> 03:36:09.140
for your continued support during this crisis.

03:36:09.140 --> 03:36:11.300
We also appreciate the board's recent approval

03:36:11.300 --> 03:36:12.460
of the shortened assessments

03:36:12.460 --> 03:36:14.180
to give LEAs more options

03:36:14.180 --> 03:36:17.100
to assess students during distance learning.

03:36:17.100 --> 03:36:19.780
However, we're concerned that LEAs will be unable

03:36:19.780 --> 03:36:24.780
to meet the 95% participation rate as required by ESEA.

03:36:25.180 --> 03:36:27.060
As you recognize in the prior item,

03:36:27.060 --> 03:36:28.620
local conditions make it difficult

03:36:28.620 --> 03:36:30.340
to offer in-person assessments

03:36:30.340 --> 03:36:34.380
and in some cases CD guidance prevents remote assessments

03:36:34.380 --> 03:36:37.820
such as with the California alternate assessments.

03:36:37.820 --> 03:36:39.780
This will disproportionately impact

03:36:39.780 --> 03:36:41.980
the special education student group

03:36:41.980 --> 03:36:44.700
and the academic indicator making it difficult

03:36:44.700 --> 03:36:46.540
to accurately identify districts

03:36:46.540 --> 03:36:48.620
for differentiated assistance.

03:36:48.620 --> 03:36:51.820
Based on how the waiver request plays out,

03:36:51.820 --> 03:36:54.260
we ask that CDE analyze the impact

03:36:54.260 --> 03:36:56.460
of the participation rate requirements

03:36:56.460 --> 03:36:58.380
for accountability purposes.

03:36:58.380 --> 03:36:59.300
Thank you.

03:36:59.300 --> 03:37:00.140
Thank you.

03:37:03.020 --> 03:37:03.860
Good afternoon.

03:37:03.860 --> 03:37:05.700
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:37:05.700 --> 03:37:06.540
You have one minute.

03:37:06.540 --> 03:37:07.460
Your time starts now.

03:37:08.700 --> 03:37:09.540
Good afternoon.

03:37:09.540 --> 03:37:11.060
It's Eric Premack with the Charter Schools

03:37:11.060 --> 03:37:12.500
Development Center again.

03:37:12.500 --> 03:37:14.300
Briefly wanna thank the Department of Ed

03:37:14.340 --> 03:37:17.180
for its vigorous defense of the DOS

03:37:17.180 --> 03:37:18.740
Dashboard Alternative System

03:37:18.740 --> 03:37:21.300
and hope that you'll continue to do so

03:37:21.300 --> 03:37:23.420
and hope that the new administration

03:37:23.420 --> 03:37:27.860
will be more reasonable in its receptivity to that.

03:37:27.860 --> 03:37:30.700
We also ask that the dashboard respect

03:37:30.700 --> 03:37:33.380
the ongoing credentialing flexibility

03:37:33.380 --> 03:37:35.100
that's afforded to charter schools

03:37:35.100 --> 03:37:39.060
and that charter schools not be punished

03:37:39.060 --> 03:37:42.780
for using that flexibility in the dashboard rankings.

03:37:42.780 --> 03:37:43.620
Thank you.

03:37:43.700 --> 03:37:44.740
Thank you.

03:37:44.740 --> 03:37:47.260
That concludes public comment for item number four.

03:37:49.980 --> 03:37:51.100
Thanks very much.

03:37:52.980 --> 03:37:55.300
Make sure I'm off of mute.

03:37:55.300 --> 03:37:58.660
So at this point, we will open up for board discussion.

03:37:59.780 --> 03:38:03.540
Do we have any hands raised?

03:38:03.540 --> 03:38:04.860
I don't see any yet.

03:38:07.980 --> 03:38:10.060
And if this seems straightforward,

03:38:11.100 --> 03:38:12.540
we can go to a motion.

03:38:14.620 --> 03:38:19.620
I am not seeing any questions or comments from the board.

03:38:21.420 --> 03:38:25.300
Is there a motion on behalf of the recommendations?

03:38:27.020 --> 03:38:29.420
Yes, I've moved the department's recommendation

03:38:29.420 --> 03:38:30.260
on this item.

03:38:31.460 --> 03:38:32.860
Right, we have a second.

03:38:32.860 --> 03:38:34.460
I second it.

03:38:34.460 --> 03:38:36.660
All right, is there any further discussion?

03:38:37.980 --> 03:38:40.260
Hearing none, we'll take a roll call vote.

03:38:41.220 --> 03:38:42.060
Number son.

03:38:43.060 --> 03:38:44.100
Aye.

03:38:44.100 --> 03:38:46.140
Vice President Strauss.

03:38:46.140 --> 03:38:47.300
Yes.

03:38:47.300 --> 03:38:48.140
Member Rucker.

03:38:53.860 --> 03:38:54.700
Member Rodriguez.

03:38:54.700 --> 03:38:55.900
Aye.

03:38:55.900 --> 03:38:57.060
Thank you, member Rucker.

03:38:57.060 --> 03:38:57.900
Member Rodriguez.

03:38:57.900 --> 03:38:59.660
Yes, yes.

03:39:01.340 --> 03:39:02.580
Member Patil Brownson.

03:39:03.700 --> 03:39:04.780
Yes.

03:39:04.780 --> 03:39:05.620
Member Navo.

03:39:06.460 --> 03:39:07.420
Yes.

03:39:07.420 --> 03:39:08.340
Member McQuillin.

03:39:09.340 --> 03:39:10.460
Aye.

03:39:10.540 --> 03:39:11.620
Member Glover Woods.

03:39:13.100 --> 03:39:14.180
Yes.

03:39:14.180 --> 03:39:15.020
Member Fatah.

03:39:15.980 --> 03:39:16.980
Yes.

03:39:16.980 --> 03:39:18.820
President Darling-Hammond.

03:39:18.820 --> 03:39:19.860
Yes.

03:39:19.860 --> 03:39:21.460
Member Burr.

03:39:21.460 --> 03:39:22.300
Aye.

03:39:25.660 --> 03:39:27.140
Terrific, thank you.

03:39:27.140 --> 03:39:30.940
And before we thank you and excuse you, Joe and Cindy,

03:39:30.940 --> 03:39:34.620
I do want to just ask for clarification on a question

03:39:34.620 --> 03:39:36.780
that a couple of the public commenters asked

03:39:36.780 --> 03:39:41.780
about when the data on expenditures and teachers

03:39:43.260 --> 03:39:45.340
will be made available.

03:39:47.940 --> 03:39:50.220
Linda, I'm happy to take that question.

03:39:50.220 --> 03:39:51.180
Thank you.

03:39:51.180 --> 03:39:56.180
So the expenditure reports were collected

03:39:58.020 --> 03:40:00.260
for the first time for our LARPs,

03:40:00.260 --> 03:40:04.500
which is our local educational accountability report cards.

03:40:04.540 --> 03:40:08.300
And that is something that we expect to be out

03:40:08.300 --> 03:40:09.380
in the next couple of weeks.

03:40:09.380 --> 03:40:13.660
In fact, we have ready for you an information memoranda

03:40:13.660 --> 03:40:17.140
about that information and how it's new

03:40:17.140 --> 03:40:18.820
and how it was collected.

03:40:18.820 --> 03:40:21.020
So you'll be receiving that information

03:40:21.020 --> 03:40:24.180
through a formal board memo in February.

03:40:24.180 --> 03:40:27.620
In regard to the teacher equity data,

03:40:27.620 --> 03:40:30.820
I know that Barb Murchison is on the call

03:40:30.820 --> 03:40:33.100
if we need additional assistance,

03:40:33.100 --> 03:40:35.780
but we are still working with our partners

03:40:35.780 --> 03:40:37.820
at the Commission on Teacher Credentialing

03:40:37.820 --> 03:40:41.700
to match the data set that they've now processed

03:40:41.700 --> 03:40:46.700
for the first time in their new data system, CalSAS.

03:40:47.020 --> 03:40:50.900
So we are anxiously awaiting that data file.

03:40:50.900 --> 03:40:52.780
So I don't yet have access to that data.

03:40:52.780 --> 03:40:55.540
I'm hoping in the next couple of weeks we will have access

03:40:55.540 --> 03:40:58.020
and then we'll do our best to, again,

03:40:58.020 --> 03:41:00.100
report that information out to the builders

03:41:00.100 --> 03:41:01.780
as soon as we are able.

03:41:02.740 --> 03:41:04.620
Terrific, we will anxiously await it.

03:41:04.620 --> 03:41:06.740
And thank you so much, Joe and Cindy

03:41:06.740 --> 03:41:08.620
for that great presentation.

03:41:08.620 --> 03:41:09.460
Thank you.

03:41:10.820 --> 03:41:14.460
And we're gonna forge right on ahead to item number five,

03:41:14.460 --> 03:41:16.980
which is the State Educational Agency approval

03:41:16.980 --> 03:41:21.060
of the 2020-21 Comprehensive Support and Improvement Plans

03:41:21.060 --> 03:41:24.020
authorized under the Every Student Succeeds Act,

03:41:24.020 --> 03:41:26.940
Section 1111D.

03:41:28.060 --> 03:41:30.420
The CDE recommends that we take action

03:41:30.620 --> 03:41:32.740
to approve those plans.

03:41:32.740 --> 03:41:35.460
And this item will be presented by Lindsay Tomator

03:41:35.460 --> 03:41:38.340
from the CDE with Laura Traian

03:41:38.340 --> 03:41:41.140
from the Marin County Office of Education

03:41:41.140 --> 03:41:44.660
with Tyler Graff from the San Rafael School District

03:41:44.660 --> 03:41:46.700
and Stephen Green and Patricia Carlin

03:41:46.700 --> 03:41:49.860
of the San Diego County Office of Education.

03:41:49.860 --> 03:41:51.340
A group project.

03:41:51.340 --> 03:41:54.700
Lindsay, would you like to begin?

03:41:54.700 --> 03:41:55.540
Thank you.

03:41:55.540 --> 03:41:57.780
Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond,

03:41:57.780 --> 03:42:00.380
Vice President Strauss, and members of the Board

03:42:01.340 --> 03:42:02.180
and happy new year.

03:42:02.180 --> 03:42:03.260
My name is Lindsay Tornatore

03:42:03.260 --> 03:42:05.620
and I am the Director of the Student Achievement

03:42:05.620 --> 03:42:08.580
and Support Division here at the Department of Education.

03:42:08.580 --> 03:42:12.060
I am joined by my esteemed colleagues from Marin

03:42:12.060 --> 03:42:14.460
and San Diego County Office of Education

03:42:14.460 --> 03:42:16.140
who will be joining me a little later on

03:42:16.140 --> 03:42:18.300
during this presentation to share some stories

03:42:18.300 --> 03:42:20.660
of their work in their counties.

03:42:20.660 --> 03:42:22.300
As President Darling-Hammond stated,

03:42:22.300 --> 03:42:25.620
this is an action item that the CDE is requesting

03:42:25.620 --> 03:42:27.540
the State Board of Education

03:42:27.540 --> 03:42:29.460
to approve the comprehensive support

03:42:29.460 --> 03:42:33.220
and improvement plans for the 2020-21 school year.

03:42:33.220 --> 03:42:35.020
As many of you will recall,

03:42:35.020 --> 03:42:37.340
this is not the first time that you have taken action

03:42:37.340 --> 03:42:40.380
to approve California CSI school plans.

03:42:40.380 --> 03:42:44.060
In fact, it was just one year ago in January of 2020

03:42:44.060 --> 03:42:46.260
that all of you approved the CSI plans

03:42:46.260 --> 03:42:50.020
for the 2019-2020 school year for cohort one.

03:42:50.020 --> 03:42:51.980
And it was during the discussion of that item

03:42:51.980 --> 03:42:53.940
that the Board expressed some concern

03:42:53.940 --> 03:42:57.180
about the CSI plan review and approval process

03:42:57.180 --> 03:42:59.300
and while the plan review and approval process

03:42:59.300 --> 03:43:02.260
is still the same this year as it was last year,

03:43:02.260 --> 03:43:04.900
I do hope that this presentation is able to address

03:43:04.900 --> 03:43:07.820
some of the concerns and questions that were raised.

03:43:07.820 --> 03:43:09.460
Specifically, this item will provide

03:43:09.460 --> 03:43:11.740
a comprehensive overview of the state

03:43:11.740 --> 03:43:14.820
and federal requirements that guide the development,

03:43:14.820 --> 03:43:18.020
implementation, monitoring, and evaluation

03:43:18.020 --> 03:43:20.020
of CSI plans and activities.

03:43:23.940 --> 03:43:25.300
Before we dive into the item,

03:43:25.300 --> 03:43:26.540
I would like to walk us through

03:43:26.540 --> 03:43:27.980
some of the significant events

03:43:27.980 --> 03:43:29.820
that got us to where we are today.

03:43:29.820 --> 03:43:32.500
In December of 2015, President Obama

03:43:32.500 --> 03:43:35.540
signed the Every Student Succeeds Act into law.

03:43:35.540 --> 03:43:38.460
In July of 2018, California's ESSA State Plan

03:43:38.460 --> 03:43:41.860
was first approved by the U.S. Department of Education.

03:43:41.860 --> 03:43:46.300
Then in September of 2018, AB 716 was signed into law

03:43:46.300 --> 03:43:49.020
to allow for the School Plan for Student Achievement,

03:43:49.020 --> 03:43:53.460
or SIPSA, to meet ESSA CSI planning requirements.

03:43:53.460 --> 03:43:56.460
In January of 2019, the State Board adopted

03:43:57.380 --> 03:43:59.780
the current CSI plan review and approval process,

03:43:59.780 --> 03:44:01.660
which included the adoption

03:44:01.660 --> 03:44:05.100
of a revised LCAP plan summary section

03:44:05.100 --> 03:44:09.460
that includes three CSI summary prompts.

03:44:09.460 --> 03:44:11.940
2020, the board approved the CSI plans

03:44:11.940 --> 03:44:13.980
for the first cohort of CSI schools,

03:44:13.980 --> 03:44:16.580
which were identified using the 2018 dashboard.

03:44:18.980 --> 03:44:20.700
And that brings us to today.

03:44:20.700 --> 03:44:23.380
Again, the request is for an action item

03:44:23.420 --> 03:44:28.020
to approve the 2020-21 school year CSI plans.

03:44:28.020 --> 03:44:30.180
Before we request your action,

03:44:30.180 --> 03:44:31.340
I will provide the overview

03:44:31.340 --> 03:44:33.740
of the CSI plan approval process.

03:44:33.740 --> 03:44:38.700
And of course, in 2019, when the process was adopted,

03:44:38.700 --> 03:44:41.660
none of us imagined where we would be in 2020

03:44:41.660 --> 03:44:44.660
with the current state of our educational landscape.

03:44:44.660 --> 03:44:46.220
So therefore, I will also be sure

03:44:46.220 --> 03:44:47.820
to point out some modifications

03:44:47.820 --> 03:44:49.540
that we had to make this year

03:44:49.540 --> 03:44:51.020
within the review approval process

03:44:51.020 --> 03:44:53.660
in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

03:44:53.660 --> 03:44:55.300
And the final part of this item,

03:44:55.300 --> 03:44:57.020
and arguably the best part,

03:44:57.020 --> 03:44:59.100
is to share two stories from the field

03:44:59.100 --> 03:45:02.100
that show how in Marin and San Diego County,

03:45:02.100 --> 03:45:04.780
the County Office of Education and the LEA

03:45:04.780 --> 03:45:07.420
are working together to surround their CSI schools

03:45:07.420 --> 03:45:08.860
with support that guides them

03:45:08.860 --> 03:45:11.100
through their continuous improvement journeys.

03:45:13.460 --> 03:45:16.060
So the first and most important question, of course,

03:45:16.060 --> 03:45:17.820
is who is being approved?

03:45:17.820 --> 03:45:20.820
As mentioned, the second cohort of CSI schools

03:45:21.660 --> 03:45:24.580
using the 2019 California School Dashboard,

03:45:24.580 --> 03:45:26.620
these plans have been developed by LEAs

03:45:26.620 --> 03:45:30.300
in collaboration with their schools and stakeholders.

03:45:30.300 --> 03:45:32.620
Attachment one and the addendum of this item

03:45:32.620 --> 03:45:35.500
include the list of LEAs with approved responses

03:45:35.500 --> 03:45:38.620
to the 2020-21 CSI prompt.

03:45:42.100 --> 03:45:44.220
So the second question of what is being approved

03:45:44.220 --> 03:45:47.100
or what should we expect to be in the CSI plans

03:45:47.100 --> 03:45:48.340
can be addressed by reviewing

03:45:48.340 --> 03:45:51.260
what the ESSA statute requires LEAs

03:45:51.260 --> 03:45:54.380
and their CSI schools to do when developing,

03:45:54.380 --> 03:45:58.660
implementing, monitoring, and evaluating their CSI plans.

03:45:58.660 --> 03:46:01.660
ESSA statute requires that CSI plans are developed

03:46:01.660 --> 03:46:04.260
to include evidence-based interventions,

03:46:04.260 --> 03:46:06.060
strategies, and activities

03:46:06.060 --> 03:46:08.620
that match the reason for identification

03:46:08.620 --> 03:46:10.300
and with the strongest evidence

03:46:10.300 --> 03:46:12.940
to improve outcomes for each student

03:46:12.940 --> 03:46:15.140
and sustain those improvements over time.

03:46:16.140 --> 03:46:19.820
ESSA statute also requires that the LEA shall,

03:46:19.820 --> 03:46:21.500
for each identified school

03:46:21.500 --> 03:46:23.180
and in partnership with stakeholders,

03:46:23.180 --> 03:46:25.580
develop and implement a CSI plan

03:46:25.580 --> 03:46:27.660
for the school to improve that,

03:46:27.660 --> 03:46:30.220
is informed by all state indicators,

03:46:30.220 --> 03:46:32.900
includes evidence-based interventions,

03:46:32.900 --> 03:46:35.940
is based on a school-level needs assessment,

03:46:35.940 --> 03:46:37.860
and identifies resource inequities,

03:46:37.860 --> 03:46:40.660
which may include a review of LEA

03:46:40.660 --> 03:46:42.220
and school-level budgeting

03:46:42.220 --> 03:46:45.420
to be addressed by the implementation of the CSI plan.

03:46:48.540 --> 03:46:52.020
So in addition to the ESSA requirement for LEAs

03:46:52.020 --> 03:46:55.260
in partnership with stakeholders and their CSI schools

03:46:55.260 --> 03:46:58.540
to develop and implement the CSI plan,

03:46:58.540 --> 03:47:01.380
also ESSA statute requires that CSI plans

03:47:01.380 --> 03:47:03.580
must be approved by the school,

03:47:03.580 --> 03:47:06.340
the LEA, and the state educational agency.

03:47:06.780 --> 03:47:08.980
So in our ESSA state plan,

03:47:08.980 --> 03:47:13.500
California has and continues to amend and write

03:47:13.500 --> 03:47:15.700
based on the commitment that we have

03:47:15.700 --> 03:47:18.540
to align state and federal educational policies

03:47:18.540 --> 03:47:20.380
to the greatest extent possible

03:47:20.380 --> 03:47:22.580
to develop an integrated local, state,

03:47:22.580 --> 03:47:24.140
and federal accountability

03:47:24.140 --> 03:47:26.020
and continuous improvement system

03:47:26.020 --> 03:47:27.940
that is grounded in the LCFF.

03:47:30.940 --> 03:47:32.500
In our original plan,

03:47:32.500 --> 03:47:34.900
California did not have a state-level

03:47:35.060 --> 03:47:38.020
plan, California did commit to review

03:47:38.020 --> 03:47:40.140
and approve initial CSI plans,

03:47:40.140 --> 03:47:42.180
including a review of how the LEAs

03:47:42.180 --> 03:47:44.420
will address identified resource inequities.

03:47:46.500 --> 03:47:49.100
Of course, it has always been California's goal

03:47:49.100 --> 03:47:51.540
to fit the federal accountability system

03:47:51.540 --> 03:47:53.860
into the state accountability system.

03:47:53.860 --> 03:47:56.580
And so the process that was adopted in 2019

03:47:56.580 --> 03:48:00.420
leverages two key pieces of our state accountability system,

03:48:00.420 --> 03:48:02.420
which are the CPSA and the LCAP.

03:48:02.420 --> 03:48:05.100
The CPSA, which has a template with instructions

03:48:05.100 --> 03:48:07.420
that meet all CSI planning requirements

03:48:07.420 --> 03:48:10.340
as per ESSA is posted,

03:48:10.340 --> 03:48:12.180
and the school site council requirements

03:48:12.180 --> 03:48:14.700
associated with the CPSA also meet

03:48:14.700 --> 03:48:17.340
the ESSA stakeholder engagement requirements.

03:48:17.340 --> 03:48:22.220
An approved CPSA serves as the school CSI plan.

03:48:22.220 --> 03:48:25.180
The LCAP includes three CSI prompts

03:48:25.180 --> 03:48:28.940
that once the school has an approved CPSA or CSI plan,

03:48:28.940 --> 03:48:31.780
then the LEA summarizes these plans in those prompts.

03:48:34.820 --> 03:48:36.940
The purpose of the prompts in the LCAP

03:48:36.940 --> 03:48:39.380
is to report how the LEA has supported

03:48:39.380 --> 03:48:41.860
each of its identified CSI schools

03:48:41.860 --> 03:48:44.820
in the development, monitoring, and evaluation

03:48:44.820 --> 03:48:48.780
of the implementation and effectiveness of their CSI plans.

03:48:48.780 --> 03:48:50.500
So the three prompts that are currently

03:48:50.500 --> 03:48:53.980
in the LCAP summary section are identify the schools

03:48:53.980 --> 03:48:57.580
within the LEA that have been identified for CSI,

03:48:57.580 --> 03:49:00.980
describe how the LEA supported the identified schools

03:49:00.980 --> 03:49:03.780
in developing CSI plans that included

03:49:03.780 --> 03:49:08.780
a school level needs assessment and the identification

03:49:08.900 --> 03:49:11.100
of any resource inequities to be addressed

03:49:11.100 --> 03:49:14.020
through the implementation of the CSI plan.

03:49:14.020 --> 03:49:17.020
And third, describe how the LEA will monitor

03:49:17.020 --> 03:49:19.940
and evaluate the implementation and effectiveness

03:49:19.940 --> 03:49:23.140
of the CSI plan to support student and school improvement.

03:49:23.540 --> 03:49:28.540
So to give a visual of the current review

03:49:29.700 --> 03:49:31.580
and approval process, we'll start at the top

03:49:31.580 --> 03:49:33.060
in the orange box.

03:49:33.060 --> 03:49:35.340
The LEA in partnership with stakeholders

03:49:35.340 --> 03:49:39.420
and their school site council develops the CPSA,

03:49:39.420 --> 03:49:40.660
which of course, as mentioned,

03:49:40.660 --> 03:49:43.740
includes all of the CSI planning requirements.

03:49:43.740 --> 03:49:47.340
Then the LEA governing board approves the CSI plan.

03:49:48.260 --> 03:49:51.420
The LEA then summarizes its support of identified schools

03:49:51.420 --> 03:49:55.140
through the CSI planning prompts in the LCAP plan summary.

03:49:55.140 --> 03:49:58.820
The county office approves the LEA's LCAP,

03:49:58.820 --> 03:50:01.220
which includes the CSI summary plan.

03:50:01.220 --> 03:50:04.940
And then the CDE brings the list of LEAs

03:50:04.940 --> 03:50:07.660
with approved CSI prompts to the board for approval.

03:50:10.540 --> 03:50:13.540
So of course, this year was a unique year,

03:50:13.540 --> 03:50:16.620
hopefully the only unique year that we will experience.

03:50:16.620 --> 03:50:20.660
And so in light of that, of our current landscape,

03:50:20.660 --> 03:50:22.940
we had to make a slight modification.

03:50:22.940 --> 03:50:26.100
So when Senate Bill 98 waived the requirement for LEAs

03:50:26.100 --> 03:50:29.940
to complete an LCAP for the 2020-21 school year,

03:50:29.940 --> 03:50:32.780
and the learning continuity plan replaced the LCAP,

03:50:32.780 --> 03:50:34.780
the learning continuity plan does not,

03:50:34.780 --> 03:50:37.660
did not include the three CSI summary prompts.

03:50:37.660 --> 03:50:40.620
So therefore the CDE created a standalone template

03:50:40.620 --> 03:50:43.540
for LEAs to complete the required CSI prompts.

03:50:44.460 --> 03:50:47.660
This template and instructions to complete the prompts

03:50:47.660 --> 03:50:51.860
were posted on the CDE website in September of 2020.

03:50:51.860 --> 03:50:56.860
Our CDE team hosted a webinar for LEAs and COEs

03:50:57.260 --> 03:51:00.620
that in September 2020 to walk through the template

03:51:00.620 --> 03:51:05.220
and the instructions, which had approximately 770 attendees.

03:51:05.220 --> 03:51:07.780
And then the CSI prompts were due from the LEA

03:51:07.780 --> 03:51:12.700
to their COE or to the CDE if applicable by October 31st.

03:51:13.700 --> 03:51:17.980
We want to emphasize that the final step

03:51:17.980 --> 03:51:20.460
in the CSI plan and approval process

03:51:20.460 --> 03:51:22.460
is that the LEAs are required

03:51:22.460 --> 03:51:26.820
to post their COE approved 2020-21 CSI prompts

03:51:26.820 --> 03:51:28.460
to the same webpage that they post

03:51:28.460 --> 03:51:30.580
their learning continuity plan,

03:51:30.580 --> 03:51:33.660
LCAP federal addendum, CSI plan,

03:51:33.660 --> 03:51:35.780
and any other planning documents.

03:51:35.780 --> 03:51:38.380
And I would like to just really quickly point out too

03:51:38.380 --> 03:51:40.860
that this is an extra step, right?

03:51:41.180 --> 03:51:44.980
That typically our LEAs do not need to do

03:51:44.980 --> 03:51:47.980
because when they typically post their LCAPs,

03:51:47.980 --> 03:51:50.140
their CSI prompts are included in it.

03:51:50.140 --> 03:51:52.900
So we made sure to provide some guidance on this point.

03:51:55.060 --> 03:51:58.380
The CSI plan approval process begins during the development

03:51:58.380 --> 03:52:00.740
through the meaningful stakeholder engagement

03:52:00.740 --> 03:52:03.580
and approval of the local governing boards.

03:52:03.580 --> 03:52:05.060
Once the plan is approved,

03:52:05.060 --> 03:52:07.500
implementation of the plan can begin.

03:52:07.500 --> 03:52:09.380
The LEA and school work together

03:52:09.380 --> 03:52:12.740
to continuously monitor and evaluate the implementation

03:52:12.740 --> 03:52:15.140
and effectiveness of the plan.

03:52:15.140 --> 03:52:17.700
This sample timeline is an example of the guidance

03:52:17.700 --> 03:52:19.740
that the CDE has provided to the field

03:52:19.740 --> 03:52:23.260
to help map out when CSI activities could be happening.

03:52:26.060 --> 03:52:29.580
So I have talked a lot about the roles and responsibilities

03:52:29.580 --> 03:52:33.300
of the counties and LEAs to support their CSI schools

03:52:33.300 --> 03:52:35.700
as continuous improvement process.

03:52:35.700 --> 03:52:39.220
The CDE also plays a critical role in leadership

03:52:40.060 --> 03:52:41.620
to our county offices and LEAs.

03:52:41.620 --> 03:52:43.900
So the school improvement and support office,

03:52:43.900 --> 03:52:46.540
which is in our division and led by my colleague,

03:52:46.540 --> 03:52:49.420
Lori Marshall is the key connection point

03:52:49.420 --> 03:52:52.780
for all CSI schools, LEAs and county offices.

03:52:52.780 --> 03:52:55.380
This is a small sample of the high quality coaching

03:52:55.380 --> 03:52:58.020
and professional learning developments offerings

03:52:58.020 --> 03:52:59.340
that are constantly being produced

03:52:59.340 --> 03:53:00.780
and shared with the field.

03:53:00.780 --> 03:53:03.220
And a more comprehensive list of their activities

03:53:03.220 --> 03:53:06.580
is included in attachment two of this item

03:53:06.580 --> 03:53:07.860
and shameless plug,

03:53:07.860 --> 03:53:10.140
I encourage anyone who is watching this

03:53:10.140 --> 03:53:13.260
to visit our CSI CDE webpage

03:53:13.260 --> 03:53:15.180
and click on the technical assistance tab

03:53:15.180 --> 03:53:18.860
to see a comprehensive list of resources and support.

03:53:22.540 --> 03:53:25.540
And now I'd like to turn this over to our co-presenters.

03:53:25.540 --> 03:53:29.020
So California's educational system is founded on the belief

03:53:29.020 --> 03:53:32.020
that the LEA is the primary unit of change

03:53:32.020 --> 03:53:34.380
and plays the central role in supporting schools

03:53:34.380 --> 03:53:37.300
to implement and sustain improvement efforts.

03:53:37.300 --> 03:53:39.660
California's diversity requires

03:53:39.660 --> 03:53:41.660
a more than a one size fits all solution

03:53:41.660 --> 03:53:44.420
to help LEAs and schools successfully implement

03:53:44.420 --> 03:53:46.380
continuous improvement efforts

03:53:46.380 --> 03:53:47.940
and meet the needs of all learners,

03:53:47.940 --> 03:53:50.580
particularly those students most in need.

03:53:50.580 --> 03:53:52.900
Although they will be differentiated to meet local needs

03:53:52.900 --> 03:53:55.100
to the greatest extent possible,

03:53:55.100 --> 03:53:57.380
all of California's supports and interventions

03:53:57.380 --> 03:54:00.140
for schools and districts will be implemented

03:54:00.140 --> 03:54:01.460
within the larger context

03:54:01.460 --> 03:54:03.820
of our statewide system of support.

03:54:03.820 --> 03:54:07.100
So it is my pleasure to now turn this presentation

03:54:07.900 --> 03:54:09.740
over to our co-presenters.

03:54:09.740 --> 03:54:12.660
First, we will hear a presentation from Laura Trahan,

03:54:12.660 --> 03:54:14.500
Director of Education Services

03:54:14.500 --> 03:54:16.820
from Marin County Office of Education,

03:54:16.820 --> 03:54:19.700
and Tyler Graff, Director of Secondary Education

03:54:19.700 --> 03:54:21.940
at San Rafael City Schools.

03:54:21.940 --> 03:54:24.020
And then we will hear from San Diego County

03:54:24.020 --> 03:54:25.420
Office of Education,

03:54:25.420 --> 03:54:28.140
Steven Green, Senior Director of Assessment,

03:54:28.140 --> 03:54:30.060
Accountability and Evaluation,

03:54:30.060 --> 03:54:31.340
and Patricia Carlin,

03:54:31.340 --> 03:54:34.420
Coordinator of State and Federal Programs.

03:54:34.420 --> 03:54:36.460
And then we will hand it over to Laura and Tyler.

03:54:36.460 --> 03:54:39.980
Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond and board members.

03:54:39.980 --> 03:54:41.660
Thank you very much for having us today.

03:54:41.660 --> 03:54:44.380
Tyler and I are pretty excited about this,

03:54:44.380 --> 03:54:46.260
helping support this item,

03:54:46.260 --> 03:54:48.460
and then also sort of showcasing the work

03:54:48.460 --> 03:54:51.740
that our county does.

03:54:51.740 --> 03:54:54.140
Lindsay, you're driving, correct?

03:54:54.140 --> 03:54:56.180
Great, go ahead, forward to the next slide.

03:54:56.180 --> 03:54:57.940
Just a little bit about Marin County.

03:54:57.940 --> 03:55:01.900
We have approximately 35,000 plus students

03:55:01.900 --> 03:55:03.780
across 18 districts

03:55:03.780 --> 03:55:06.220
with a total of about four charter schools.

03:55:06.220 --> 03:55:08.980
We have everything from a one-room schoolhouse

03:55:08.980 --> 03:55:12.660
to a few K-8s to a larger

03:55:12.660 --> 03:55:14.940
or a medium-sized unified school district.

03:55:14.940 --> 03:55:16.780
So we have quite a variety in there.

03:55:17.660 --> 03:55:19.500
What you're looking at here are the demographics

03:55:19.500 --> 03:55:20.320
of our county.

03:55:20.320 --> 03:55:23.580
San Rafael Schools is one of our larger districts

03:55:23.580 --> 03:55:25.260
as compared to the rest of our districts.

03:55:25.260 --> 03:55:27.420
It's actually two districts combined.

03:55:27.420 --> 03:55:29.420
So we have an elementary district

03:55:29.420 --> 03:55:30.660
and a high school district

03:55:30.660 --> 03:55:33.420
that operate as San Rafael City Schools

03:55:34.020 --> 03:55:35.580
for a little over 7,000 students

03:55:35.580 --> 03:55:38.480
with eight elementary schools, three high schools,

03:55:38.480 --> 03:55:41.140
and one of those high schools is an alternative school.

03:55:41.140 --> 03:55:43.100
That's Madrone, and that's the campus

03:55:43.100 --> 03:55:45.340
that we'll be talking about today.

03:55:46.260 --> 03:55:48.540
The demographics of our county are listed here.

03:55:48.540 --> 03:55:52.100
San Rafael Elementary and high school districts,

03:55:52.100 --> 03:55:53.980
they follow a similar pattern as the county,

03:55:53.980 --> 03:55:55.940
but they have a slightly higher percentage

03:55:55.940 --> 03:55:58.100
of Hispanic and Latino students

03:55:58.100 --> 03:56:01.740
in comparison to their white students.

03:56:01.740 --> 03:56:02.580
Next slide.

03:56:04.300 --> 03:56:07.700
So what you're looking at here is a graphic

03:56:07.700 --> 03:56:11.620
or a schematic that, excuse me, that we created.

03:56:11.620 --> 03:56:15.180
And it really just sort of encompasses everything

03:56:15.180 --> 03:56:17.900
that our county office is trying to do

03:56:17.900 --> 03:56:21.820
as a system of support based upon what was established

03:56:21.820 --> 03:56:24.260
with the Department of Education.

03:56:24.260 --> 03:56:25.460
So you'll see the level one,

03:56:25.460 --> 03:56:27.180
level two, level three supports over there.

03:56:27.180 --> 03:56:29.460
And then we sort of just established a way

03:56:29.460 --> 03:56:31.700
in which we try and meet and greet those

03:56:31.700 --> 03:56:33.300
as we work with the district.

03:56:34.180 --> 03:56:38.540
So everything we do right now is built upon relationships.

03:56:40.260 --> 03:56:43.420
Our teams that we put together for all of our work

03:56:43.420 --> 03:56:45.580
are multidisciplinary as much as possible.

03:56:45.580 --> 03:56:49.100
So, excuse me, they'll frequently include curriculum

03:56:49.100 --> 03:56:53.260
and instruction, business, special education as appropriate,

03:56:53.260 --> 03:56:55.620
and also sometimes our self-elites as well.

03:56:56.540 --> 03:56:59.220
So as Lindsay mentioned, we have Tyler here today,

03:56:59.220 --> 03:57:02.040
and he's gonna co-present and give us a little bit

03:57:02.080 --> 03:57:06.280
of insight on what it feels like, I guess,

03:57:06.280 --> 03:57:09.080
to be the recipient of a support.

03:57:09.080 --> 03:57:11.280
I think as a county office, our responsibility

03:57:11.280 --> 03:57:15.440
is to use the metaphors to teach them how to fish

03:57:15.440 --> 03:57:18.600
so that our role is extended

03:57:18.600 --> 03:57:22.640
and I guess work ourselves out of a job to a certain extent

03:57:22.640 --> 03:57:27.200
as it pertains to allowing them to be independent

03:57:27.200 --> 03:57:28.640
and doing their work.

03:57:28.640 --> 03:57:30.800
They know their kids, they know their districts.

03:57:30.840 --> 03:57:33.280
Our job is just to be there to support

03:57:33.280 --> 03:57:37.800
and provide additional wheels on their wagon, if you will.

03:57:37.800 --> 03:57:40.520
So as it's listed here, we have heavy reliance

03:57:40.520 --> 03:57:42.120
on district collaboration.

03:57:42.120 --> 03:57:45.680
We plan everything together in our comprehensive support

03:57:45.680 --> 03:57:48.180
as well as in our differentiated assistance cycle.

03:57:49.360 --> 03:57:51.920
We are, again, a provision of additional support

03:57:51.920 --> 03:57:55.920
and we try as much as possible to use existing structures

03:57:58.440 --> 03:57:59.840
for any work that we do together,

03:57:59.840 --> 03:58:02.640
not adding additional meetings, et cetera.

03:58:02.640 --> 03:58:04.680
Okay, next slide, Tyler.

03:58:06.000 --> 03:58:08.280
All right, good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond

03:58:08.280 --> 03:58:09.120
and board members.

03:58:09.120 --> 03:58:11.080
It's an absolute pleasure to be here

03:58:11.080 --> 03:58:13.680
to talk a little bit about our collaboration

03:58:13.680 --> 03:58:15.680
with Marin County Office of Education.

03:58:17.320 --> 03:58:19.400
On this side, you can kind of see that,

03:58:19.400 --> 03:58:21.680
you know, there's two district model.

03:58:21.680 --> 03:58:23.760
We have one board that kind of oversees

03:58:23.760 --> 03:58:25.280
and one district office that oversees

03:58:25.280 --> 03:58:28.400
both of these districts and you can see

03:58:28.400 --> 03:58:31.120
that both the elementary and high school districts

03:58:31.120 --> 03:58:36.120
had qualified for differentiated assistance in 2018, 2019.

03:58:36.160 --> 03:58:39.440
And then the elementary district kind of worked itself

03:58:39.440 --> 03:58:43.720
out of differentiated assistance in that 19-20 year

03:58:43.720 --> 03:58:46.720
where the high school districts still had some work to do.

03:58:46.720 --> 03:58:49.440
Just for context, that elementary district is really,

03:58:49.440 --> 03:58:54.440
it's a K-8 district and, you know, that's part of,

03:58:55.120 --> 03:58:58.600
they weren't deep into differentiated assistance there.

03:58:58.600 --> 03:59:01.680
So to get them out wasn't quite as a big of a lift

03:59:01.680 --> 03:59:03.400
as the high school district was.

03:59:04.680 --> 03:59:05.520
Next slide.

03:59:05.520 --> 03:59:06.480
But just really quickly, if I could add,

03:59:06.480 --> 03:59:07.760
the whole point of starting you

03:59:07.760 --> 03:59:09.640
with differentiated assistance is,

03:59:09.640 --> 03:59:11.640
in order for you to really get an understanding

03:59:11.640 --> 03:59:14.400
about the CSI work, we had to pull way back up

03:59:14.400 --> 03:59:17.520
because this is not siloed work.

03:59:17.520 --> 03:59:19.800
This is about looking deep at a system

03:59:19.800 --> 03:59:21.760
and the order to look deep at a system,

03:59:21.760 --> 03:59:23.840
we really had to go all the way back and look,

03:59:23.840 --> 03:59:27.000
wow, we have some things that are definitely showing up.

03:59:27.000 --> 03:59:30.440
I almost added a slide on this particular item,

03:59:30.440 --> 03:59:31.960
which was their dashboard slide,

03:59:31.960 --> 03:59:34.680
where you're definitely seeing

03:59:34.680 --> 03:59:36.240
why they were in differentiated assistance

03:59:36.240 --> 03:59:38.640
and what you're not seeing are the edges

03:59:38.640 --> 03:59:40.840
of why they were in differentiated assistance.

03:59:40.840 --> 03:59:44.080
So there's some strong orange markers, if you will,

03:59:44.080 --> 03:59:45.800
to use the color terminology.

03:59:45.800 --> 03:59:47.320
So we wanted to just make sure

03:59:47.320 --> 03:59:48.680
we gave you a really clear picture,

03:59:48.680 --> 03:59:50.200
not only about our work,

03:59:50.200 --> 03:59:53.880
but about the need to look at this systemically.

03:59:53.880 --> 03:59:54.720
Okay, next slide.

03:59:56.240 --> 03:59:58.520
Great, and that's kind of where I was gonna talk here,

03:59:58.520 --> 04:00:00.240
the CSI and ATSI.

04:00:00.240 --> 04:00:05.240
You can see that CSI was really for our alternative program

04:00:06.200 --> 04:00:11.200
and then ATSI for Davidson in that 18-19 year,

04:00:11.240 --> 04:00:12.680
which is our middle school,

04:00:12.680 --> 04:00:17.680
and then our two comprehensive high schools in 19-20.

04:00:18.160 --> 04:00:21.880
And kind of to build on what Laura just said,

04:00:21.880 --> 04:00:23.120
Madrone is a unique school

04:00:23.120 --> 04:00:25.520
because it's only 11th and 12th grade,

04:00:25.520 --> 04:00:29.080
and our system creates that school, right?

04:00:29.080 --> 04:00:32.080
So the outcomes that our system is gonna produce

04:00:32.080 --> 04:00:35.320
will manifest itself at Madrone High School.

04:00:35.320 --> 04:00:37.280
So when we look at Madrone High School

04:00:37.280 --> 04:00:41.000
and we see a disproportionate number of Latinx students,

04:00:41.000 --> 04:00:43.720
we have to take a look at the whole system,

04:00:43.720 --> 04:00:45.360
not just Madrone High School.

04:00:45.360 --> 04:00:46.840
We have to take a look at

04:00:46.840 --> 04:00:49.760
what our comprehensive high schools are doing,

04:00:49.760 --> 04:00:52.800
and all the way down to our pre-K and TK programs.

04:00:52.800 --> 04:00:55.560
How are we, what early intervention programs

04:00:55.560 --> 04:00:59.680
are we getting in front of our smallest students

04:00:59.680 --> 04:01:02.200
so they're not long-term English learners,

04:01:02.200 --> 04:01:03.680
feel disaffected with school,

04:01:03.680 --> 04:01:05.760
and end up at a school like Madrone

04:01:05.760 --> 04:01:09.140
where we have to give additional support there.

04:01:10.400 --> 04:01:13.120
Laura, you wanna add anything to that one?

04:01:13.120 --> 04:01:13.960
Thank you.

04:01:15.360 --> 04:01:16.200
Okay.

04:01:20.440 --> 04:01:23.720
And then this slide just kind of talks a little bit about

04:01:23.720 --> 04:01:27.080
the collaboration and the roles here.

04:01:30.200 --> 04:01:31.600
Let's see here.

04:01:31.600 --> 04:01:35.400
So we have, we tried to use the existing structure,

04:01:35.400 --> 04:01:37.920
so we didn't wanna have additional meetings,

04:01:37.920 --> 04:01:40.680
and we know a number of districts

04:01:40.680 --> 04:01:42.800
are strapped for time as it is,

04:01:42.800 --> 04:01:47.800
so we wanted to do that as cohesively as possible.

04:01:49.000 --> 04:01:51.640
One of the things our board and our superintendent

04:01:51.640 --> 04:01:53.720
really value stakeholder engagement,

04:01:53.720 --> 04:01:57.200
so we did lots of equity interviews with our students.

04:01:57.200 --> 04:02:00.600
We brought in our DLAC parents.

04:02:00.600 --> 04:02:04.920
We had a lot of our CBOs from San Rafael City

04:02:04.920 --> 04:02:07.440
just kind of come in and give us feedback.

04:02:07.440 --> 04:02:12.440
And then obviously having quite a bit of support from MCOE

04:02:13.120 --> 04:02:13.960
as well.

04:02:15.080 --> 04:02:20.080
Just to add, we combined the district

04:02:20.520 --> 04:02:25.000
and to do the DA process and deliberately

04:02:25.000 --> 04:02:28.260
the superintendent and Tyler and his amazing staff

04:02:28.260 --> 04:02:32.040
insisted on the Madrone staff,

04:02:32.040 --> 04:02:33.520
as well as the high school staff

04:02:33.520 --> 04:02:35.800
being part of the differentiated assistance team,

04:02:35.800 --> 04:02:39.880
knowing that this was all going to cycle into work

04:02:39.880 --> 04:02:41.680
that was gonna be at the school site.

04:02:43.800 --> 04:02:48.240
Great, and here's a little bit about the roles

04:02:48.240 --> 04:02:49.720
and responsibilities.

04:02:49.720 --> 04:02:53.200
Obviously, it's a collaborative experience

04:02:53.200 --> 04:02:56.640
working with Marin County Office of Education,

04:02:56.640 --> 04:02:59.680
and there's kind of distinct roles

04:02:59.680 --> 04:03:01.720
that each of one of us plays.

04:03:01.720 --> 04:03:04.200
So I think from a district perspective,

04:03:04.200 --> 04:03:06.480
a couple of things that were a big highlight

04:03:06.480 --> 04:03:08.600
was that I was able to kind of collaborate

04:03:08.600 --> 04:03:12.240
with an MCOE support person

04:03:12.240 --> 04:03:15.680
to design the agendas for the meetings.

04:03:15.680 --> 04:03:18.240
So that helped us with stakeholder engagement,

04:03:18.240 --> 04:03:20.000
helped us with needs assessments.

04:03:20.000 --> 04:03:21.640
So we were kind of doing the driving,

04:03:21.640 --> 04:03:24.360
but MCOE was helping on the front end

04:03:24.360 --> 04:03:26.020
for designing some of those meetings

04:03:26.020 --> 04:03:28.300
and then on the back end for reflection.

04:03:28.300 --> 04:03:31.560
It was really helpful to learn more about

04:03:31.560 --> 04:03:33.160
kind of from a third party,

04:03:33.160 --> 04:03:35.560
what we could have done better in those meetings.

04:03:36.480 --> 04:03:39.320
Yeah, and we used really a strong science

04:03:39.320 --> 04:03:42.080
and improvement backbone through all of that.

04:03:42.080 --> 04:03:45.480
So while each district or school that we work with

04:03:45.480 --> 04:03:48.600
is unique, the system or the process that we follow

04:03:48.600 --> 04:03:52.280
to get them to the areas they need to go to

04:03:52.280 --> 04:03:55.000
is fairly consistent.

04:03:55.000 --> 04:04:00.000
But the district really embraced this work deeply.

04:04:01.680 --> 04:04:03.320
And then this is just a broader context

04:04:03.320 --> 04:04:04.600
of where the school district is.

04:04:04.600 --> 04:04:06.840
So we have differentiated systems going on,

04:04:06.840 --> 04:04:08.920
we have CSI going on.

04:04:08.920 --> 04:04:11.680
But then our newer superintendent

04:04:11.680 --> 04:04:15.040
is actually taking us through a together 2023 process,

04:04:15.040 --> 04:04:17.040
which is kind of a revisioning of the school,

04:04:17.040 --> 04:04:21.640
a new strategic plan for the school or for the district.

04:04:21.640 --> 04:04:24.560
And a big part of that is an equity audit

04:04:24.560 --> 04:04:26.720
that we did with Ed Trust West,

04:04:26.720 --> 04:04:29.240
just taking a look at how students

04:04:29.240 --> 04:04:31.520
are getting access to AP courses,

04:04:32.000 --> 04:04:34.920
how are we getting students out of EL programs

04:04:34.920 --> 04:04:38.040
when they have been able to qualify

04:04:38.040 --> 04:04:41.880
to join the general ed program.

04:04:43.200 --> 04:04:46.400
And all of that is kind of weaving into the LCAP.

04:04:46.400 --> 04:04:48.560
And one of the highlights for me is that

04:04:48.560 --> 04:04:50.920
through the Ed Trust West equity audit

04:04:50.920 --> 04:04:52.960
and our together 2023 process,

04:04:52.960 --> 04:04:55.960
we've had extensive stakeholder input

04:04:55.960 --> 04:04:59.320
and essentially have a draft of what will be our LCAP

04:04:59.320 --> 04:05:00.400
for the next three years.

04:05:00.400 --> 04:05:02.960
So when we get to the LCAP writing process,

04:05:02.960 --> 04:05:06.960
we kind of have most of it done, which is really nice.

04:05:11.760 --> 04:05:13.600
Okay, slide 10 is really about

04:05:13.600 --> 04:05:16.240
the plan for Madrone High School.

04:05:16.240 --> 04:05:18.040
And when we took a look at the data,

04:05:19.080 --> 04:05:22.880
what we found is that a school like Madrone

04:05:22.880 --> 04:05:25.280
where it's an alternative program,

04:05:25.280 --> 04:05:28.960
really school has been the traumatizer in a lot of ways.

04:05:28.960 --> 04:05:31.680
So it's not necessarily the home life.

04:05:31.680 --> 04:05:33.800
Sometimes these students come to school

04:05:33.800 --> 04:05:36.040
and that's where they're experiencing trauma.

04:05:36.040 --> 04:05:39.000
So we wanted to focus on culture and climate.

04:05:39.000 --> 04:05:42.480
A lot of the data that we saw around engagement,

04:05:42.480 --> 04:05:46.720
around attendance and graduation really highlighted

04:05:46.720 --> 04:05:50.640
that kids needed to feel loved and cared for

04:05:50.640 --> 04:05:53.160
in a school climate.

04:05:53.160 --> 04:05:57.120
So that was a huge part of the kind of focus there.

04:05:57.120 --> 04:06:00.560
So things like restorative practices,

04:06:00.560 --> 04:06:03.960
capturing kids' hearts was another big initiative

04:06:03.960 --> 04:06:06.360
that the principal focused on.

04:06:06.360 --> 04:06:08.520
We got a school to career liaison

04:06:08.520 --> 04:06:12.520
to kind of help kids connect to post-graduate

04:06:12.520 --> 04:06:14.440
or post-graduation type work.

04:06:15.480 --> 04:06:18.520
The school also did a really nice three-day workshop

04:06:18.520 --> 04:06:20.360
to kind of re-envision the school

04:06:21.240 --> 04:06:23.640
talk a little bit more about how students engage

04:06:23.640 --> 04:06:24.800
with the curriculum,

04:06:24.800 --> 04:06:27.360
really focusing in on that instructional core,

04:06:27.360 --> 04:06:30.200
how kids feel when they walk into the building.

04:06:31.040 --> 04:06:32.640
That was all really important.

04:06:32.640 --> 04:06:35.120
And then there was another thing that they focus on.

04:06:35.120 --> 04:06:37.440
They noticed that there were about 14 kids

04:06:37.440 --> 04:06:41.200
at the end of last year that were not on path to graduate.

04:06:41.200 --> 04:06:44.800
And we did a really nice targeted summer school program.

04:06:44.800 --> 04:06:48.000
They got nine of those 14 kids to graduate.

04:06:48.000 --> 04:06:52.000
And that resulted in actually our alternative school

04:06:52.000 --> 04:06:53.520
being the only school,

04:06:53.520 --> 04:06:56.360
only high school that increased its graduation rate

04:06:56.360 --> 04:06:57.200
last year.

04:06:57.200 --> 04:07:00.880
So this really targeted approach was very helpful.

04:07:00.880 --> 04:07:02.800
And then the superintendent was really helpful

04:07:02.800 --> 04:07:06.920
in kind of loosening some strings

04:07:06.920 --> 04:07:09.120
in order to change staffing around.

04:07:10.280 --> 04:07:12.920
What we know about good teaching and learning

04:07:12.920 --> 04:07:15.560
is that a high quality teacher matters a lot.

04:07:15.560 --> 04:07:18.160
And if we don't have our highest quality teachers

04:07:18.160 --> 04:07:20.080
in front of our most needy students,

04:07:20.080 --> 04:07:21.560
we need to make changes.

04:07:21.560 --> 04:07:23.200
And our superintendent was bold enough

04:07:23.840 --> 04:07:25.800
to be able to make some of those changes.

04:07:31.760 --> 04:07:32.600
Okay.

04:07:34.440 --> 04:07:35.280
Excellent.

04:07:35.280 --> 04:07:36.120
Okay.

04:07:36.120 --> 04:07:38.440
So again, our whole process in summary,

04:07:38.440 --> 04:07:40.080
this is kind of a summary slide here,

04:07:40.080 --> 04:07:43.640
is really that this is a system support process

04:07:43.640 --> 04:07:47.720
that looked at engagement at all levels.

04:07:47.720 --> 04:07:49.880
It's fully encompassing.

04:07:49.880 --> 04:07:53.880
And everything that we need to do is all,

04:07:53.880 --> 04:07:55.720
I hate to use the word equity lens

04:07:55.720 --> 04:07:58.760
because that implies that it's just kind of like this,

04:07:58.760 --> 04:08:00.400
it's more like a blanket, if you will.

04:08:00.400 --> 04:08:04.320
We really had to look at every single child

04:08:04.320 --> 04:08:05.600
with the district.

04:08:05.600 --> 04:08:06.440
They were fortunate enough

04:08:06.440 --> 04:08:09.120
to have all of those really great equity audit.

04:08:09.120 --> 04:08:11.760
And a lot of the slides you saw

04:08:11.760 --> 04:08:14.880
were the actual data sessions that they held with us,

04:08:14.880 --> 04:08:17.280
with educators, with kids.

04:08:17.280 --> 04:08:21.560
And really, honestly, I think one of the biggest pieces

04:08:21.560 --> 04:08:25.040
they got out of this process is number one,

04:08:25.040 --> 04:08:28.040
they're addressing the needs on the day to day,

04:08:28.040 --> 04:08:30.600
despite COVID with Madrone,

04:08:30.600 --> 04:08:33.000
but they got to see that this is a process,

04:08:33.000 --> 04:08:35.520
and this is not necessarily a process that ends.

04:08:35.520 --> 04:08:39.080
It's a process that continues to circle on itself.

04:08:39.080 --> 04:08:42.440
And they're having to use,

04:08:42.440 --> 04:08:44.320
because of the size of the school,

04:08:44.320 --> 04:08:46.760
but also because of the time that they're in,

04:08:46.760 --> 04:08:49.040
they're having to use kind of alternative means

04:08:49.040 --> 04:08:50.800
to measure their success.

04:08:50.800 --> 04:08:53.440
So they can't necessarily rely upon

04:08:53.440 --> 04:08:55.040
standardized test scores, et cetera.

04:08:55.040 --> 04:08:58.320
So it's a nice time for educators

04:08:58.320 --> 04:09:01.720
to really look at being flexible

04:09:01.720 --> 04:09:05.240
and really look at what student needs are.

04:09:06.520 --> 04:09:08.040
The only thing I'd add there, Laura,

04:09:08.040 --> 04:09:09.640
is it was a little unfortunate

04:09:09.640 --> 04:09:11.920
that we focused on culture and climate,

04:09:11.920 --> 04:09:15.440
and then a handful of months later told kids

04:09:15.440 --> 04:09:16.480
you can't come back to school,

04:09:17.320 --> 04:09:19.320
because you can't really focus on culture and climate

04:09:19.320 --> 04:09:20.640
when there aren't students in the building.

04:09:20.640 --> 04:09:23.520
So that was one of the things

04:09:23.520 --> 04:09:25.720
we're really eager to get students back.

04:09:25.720 --> 04:09:28.840
Our district is right on the precipice of having an MOU

04:09:28.840 --> 04:09:29.840
with our high school district

04:09:29.840 --> 04:09:32.040
to get those students back into school.

04:09:32.040 --> 04:09:35.720
And we're really hoping that we can refocus on that

04:09:35.720 --> 04:09:38.040
and continue to use those equity interviews

04:09:38.040 --> 04:09:40.920
that we did with students to understand better

04:09:40.920 --> 04:09:43.760
where we're winning and improving the school culture

04:09:43.760 --> 04:09:45.600
and where the adults need to shift

04:09:45.600 --> 04:09:49.200
to make it a more welcoming environment for those kids.

04:09:49.200 --> 04:09:51.720
Yeah, and you're scoring the equity interviews

04:09:51.720 --> 04:09:52.560
with the students.

04:09:52.560 --> 04:09:55.200
That's a startling process to go through.

04:09:55.200 --> 04:09:58.120
It's quite lovely and interesting.

04:09:58.120 --> 04:10:01.800
Okay, again, this is our system of support structure

04:10:01.800 --> 04:10:03.360
that we established and we're in.

04:10:05.360 --> 04:10:06.960
And thank you very much for having us.

04:10:06.960 --> 04:10:10.600
It's been a pleasure to support this presentation.

04:10:10.600 --> 04:10:12.200
Thank you, Lindsay, for having us.

04:10:16.600 --> 04:10:17.440
Terrific.

04:10:20.720 --> 04:10:24.080
And Lindsay, do you have anything else before we go?

04:10:24.080 --> 04:10:28.280
We're gonna now pass on to Stephen Green and Patty Carlin

04:10:28.280 --> 04:10:30.760
from San Diego County Office of Education.

04:10:33.320 --> 04:10:34.480
Good afternoon, President.

04:10:34.480 --> 04:10:36.200
I'm Darling Hammond and members of the board.

04:10:36.200 --> 04:10:38.560
Thank you for this opportunity for us to share

04:10:38.560 --> 04:10:41.360
how we are supporting our local LEAs

04:10:41.360 --> 04:10:44.560
and eligible schools in San Diego County.

04:10:44.600 --> 04:10:46.040
I'm Stephen Green, Senior Director

04:10:46.040 --> 04:10:47.720
for our Assessment, Accountability,

04:10:47.720 --> 04:10:49.560
and Program Evaluation Team.

04:10:49.560 --> 04:10:51.200
And with me today is Patricia Carlin,

04:10:51.200 --> 04:10:54.320
who is our Coordinator of State and Federal Programs.

04:10:54.320 --> 04:10:56.800
We will co-present and give you a high-level overview

04:10:56.800 --> 04:11:00.240
of our process in supporting our CSI schools

04:11:00.240 --> 04:11:03.800
and the districts as part of our system of support.

04:11:03.800 --> 04:11:06.880
I also wanted to shout out to Antonio Mora,

04:11:06.880 --> 04:11:08.440
who's our District Advisor,

04:11:08.440 --> 04:11:09.960
who's a key component of our team

04:11:09.960 --> 04:11:12.760
but not joining us today in this presentation.

04:11:12.760 --> 04:11:15.400
So with that, I'm gonna hand off to Patty,

04:11:15.400 --> 04:11:17.280
or excuse me, not quite yet, I apologize.

04:11:17.280 --> 04:11:19.440
I'm gonna do this slide real quickly.

04:11:19.440 --> 04:11:22.240
This is just a high-level overview of the process

04:11:22.240 --> 04:11:24.960
and the key point I wanna make here is

04:11:24.960 --> 04:11:28.360
once the districts and schools are identified

04:11:28.360 --> 04:11:30.800
and we know who is eligible for support,

04:11:30.800 --> 04:11:33.840
we mobilize pretty quickly around two levels

04:11:33.840 --> 04:11:37.120
of intervention, if you will, that we provide.

04:11:37.120 --> 04:11:40.320
One is what we consider foundational support or tier one,

04:11:40.320 --> 04:11:44.840
which is support for all eligible schools and their LEAs.

04:11:44.840 --> 04:11:47.400
And that's really the technical assistance component.

04:11:47.400 --> 04:11:48.840
Patty will break that down in a moment

04:11:48.840 --> 04:11:50.680
and go into more specificity.

04:11:50.680 --> 04:11:53.840
And then there's another level, a higher level of support,

04:11:53.840 --> 04:11:55.640
which is deeper learning and work,

04:11:55.640 --> 04:11:58.080
similar to what you heard from the San Rafael team

04:11:58.080 --> 04:11:59.920
and Marin County Office of Ed,

04:11:59.920 --> 04:12:02.400
which is the deeper learning and the ongoing improvement

04:12:02.400 --> 04:12:03.760
in implementation work.

04:12:03.760 --> 04:12:06.680
And I'll be speaking to that in more detail after Patty.

04:12:06.680 --> 04:12:08.560
So with that, I'm gonna hand off to Patty

04:12:08.560 --> 04:12:10.920
and she'll talk about our timeline

04:12:10.920 --> 04:12:13.320
and how we engage our LEAs.

04:12:14.480 --> 04:12:16.760
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon,

04:12:16.760 --> 04:12:19.640
President Darling-Hammond and members of the board.

04:12:19.640 --> 04:12:22.280
So what you can see in front of you is this timeline

04:12:22.280 --> 04:12:25.400
of really how we rolled things out

04:12:25.400 --> 04:12:30.400
with the 2019 eligibility determination for CSI schools,

04:12:31.680 --> 04:12:34.200
which did happen with that fall dashboard

04:12:34.200 --> 04:12:39.200
that we had in the November, December of 2019.

04:12:39.200 --> 04:12:43.320
And then once the schools were officially announced

04:12:43.320 --> 04:12:45.280
and then kind of the grant process started,

04:12:45.280 --> 04:12:50.120
then we would work in with our orientation workshops,

04:12:50.120 --> 04:12:52.200
usually around February or so.

04:12:52.200 --> 04:12:56.560
And then we have a four series workshop series,

04:12:56.560 --> 04:13:01.560
sorry, series that we put together for the 29 LEAs

04:13:02.560 --> 04:13:05.120
that we do have in San Diego County.

04:13:05.120 --> 04:13:09.160
What we're trying to do is build that capacity

04:13:09.160 --> 04:13:12.680
of those LEAs to support their schools.

04:13:12.680 --> 04:13:16.960
Of those LEAs, 16 are districts and 13 are charters.

04:13:16.960 --> 04:13:21.100
Additionally, just kind of on a funny aside,

04:13:21.100 --> 04:13:24.000
our very first workshop that we were going

04:13:24.000 --> 04:13:27.360
to be doing face to face again was on March 13th.

04:13:27.360 --> 04:13:29.920
And so that became the first ever Zoom workshop,

04:13:29.920 --> 04:13:33.240
I think that we produced for San Diego County Office

04:13:33.240 --> 04:13:36.640
of Education during this time.

04:13:36.640 --> 04:13:39.520
So on the next slide, I will be talking

04:13:41.280 --> 04:13:45.520
about just the overall of our foundational support model.

04:13:45.520 --> 04:13:48.880
And as Lindsay had mentioned, there are the areas

04:13:48.880 --> 04:13:52.400
that are required within the CSI plan,

04:13:52.400 --> 04:13:54.400
but you're talking about needs assessment,

04:13:54.400 --> 04:13:57.520
data analysis, your cause analysis,

04:13:57.520 --> 04:14:00.440
the use of evidence-based interventions,

04:14:00.440 --> 04:14:03.080
monitoring and evaluation of the plan.

04:14:03.080 --> 04:14:06.400
Those are all actually requirements

04:14:06.400 --> 04:14:09.440
within Title I plans in general.

04:14:09.440 --> 04:14:11.760
And when we think about that,

04:14:11.760 --> 04:14:14.120
that's just good strategic planning.

04:14:14.120 --> 04:14:18.120
But those are the main core pieces of the requirements

04:14:18.120 --> 04:14:20.360
for the CSI planning.

04:14:20.360 --> 04:14:23.480
In addition to that, then there would be the identification

04:14:23.480 --> 04:14:25.280
of resource inequities.

04:14:25.280 --> 04:14:27.420
So we put our workshop series together,

04:14:28.320 --> 04:14:31.860
this was originally put together kind of that building

04:14:31.860 --> 04:14:34.860
the plane as we're flying it analogy in 2019

04:14:34.860 --> 04:14:37.180
when this first all rolled out.

04:14:37.180 --> 04:14:40.300
But one of the things, a couple of the things that we do

04:14:40.300 --> 04:14:44.540
beyond let's say just those requirements within the plan

04:14:44.540 --> 04:14:48.340
is talking about how districts and schools and charters

04:14:48.340 --> 04:14:50.780
would do that alignment of their plan.

04:14:50.780 --> 04:14:54.540
So the CPSA aligning back up to the LCAP at the time

04:14:55.220 --> 04:15:00.220
or this year we pivoted and we helped align it to their LCP.

04:15:01.260 --> 04:15:05.660
So making sure that there is a strong alignment

04:15:05.660 --> 04:15:08.100
between the plans that guide schools

04:15:08.100 --> 04:15:10.380
and the plans that guide the districts.

04:15:10.380 --> 04:15:12.940
And then we pushed further from that

04:15:12.940 --> 04:15:16.100
with the first steps in implementation.

04:15:16.100 --> 04:15:18.620
And when Steve picks up on the next slide,

04:15:18.620 --> 04:15:21.820
he'll talk a little bit further about that.

04:15:21.860 --> 04:15:25.980
But one of the things that we did after all of this

04:15:25.980 --> 04:15:30.580
was then we gave specialized trainings

04:15:30.580 --> 04:15:32.620
maybe around schools like councils

04:15:32.620 --> 04:15:35.740
for maybe for charter schools or alternative schools

04:15:35.740 --> 04:15:38.580
that had not had school set councils before.

04:15:38.580 --> 04:15:43.140
We gave more in depth LCP alignment workshops.

04:15:43.140 --> 04:15:46.100
And additionally, as part of the system of support

04:15:46.100 --> 04:15:50.820
in our region and with our Southern California region

04:15:50.820 --> 04:15:53.580
including Riverside, San Bernardino,

04:15:53.580 --> 04:15:55.820
Imperial and Orange counties,

04:15:55.820 --> 04:15:59.220
we've been working together all of our counties

04:15:59.220 --> 04:16:03.260
over the past year in supporting CSI schools

04:16:03.260 --> 04:16:05.860
and then providing workshops just for,

04:16:05.860 --> 04:16:08.420
let's say schools that are in an alternative setting

04:16:08.420 --> 04:16:13.420
to see how to make these plans and CSI work in their world.

04:16:15.340 --> 04:16:17.900
So we really have pushed further

04:16:17.900 --> 04:16:21.940
in just giving the general overview

04:16:21.940 --> 04:16:24.780
by putting things into a perspective

04:16:24.780 --> 04:16:28.100
to support the variety of schools that we have

04:16:28.100 --> 04:16:32.540
that are CSI within our county and within our region.

04:16:32.540 --> 04:16:35.020
So I will let Steve take it away from here.

04:16:37.620 --> 04:16:38.460
Thank you, Patty.

04:16:38.460 --> 04:16:40.700
And as I said in our opening,

04:16:40.700 --> 04:16:42.140
we have two levels of support.

04:16:42.140 --> 04:16:45.180
So that foundational or tier one is available to all

04:16:45.180 --> 04:16:47.220
that's free of charge, that's work that we do

04:16:47.220 --> 04:16:49.580
that we see as our role as a county office.

04:16:50.740 --> 04:16:55.460
We do offer and we saw the need right away within schools

04:16:55.460 --> 04:16:57.940
similar to the support offered

04:16:57.940 --> 04:16:59.300
through differentiated assistance

04:16:59.300 --> 04:17:02.900
where oftentimes the tier one level of support

04:17:02.900 --> 04:17:05.300
may not be sufficient for the types of needs

04:17:05.300 --> 04:17:06.860
or the equity issues that may exist

04:17:06.860 --> 04:17:09.100
within school systems or LEAs.

04:17:09.100 --> 04:17:12.380
And what we did then is we reached out to partners

04:17:12.380 --> 04:17:14.900
in the educational space that are engaged in this work.

04:17:14.900 --> 04:17:18.260
One example here is our partnership with West Ed.

04:17:18.260 --> 04:17:21.260
Through the San Francisco office and their improvement team,

04:17:21.260 --> 04:17:25.940
we have joined forces and provide as an option

04:17:25.940 --> 04:17:27.940
for CSI eligible schools

04:17:27.940 --> 04:17:30.460
and their central office partners,

04:17:30.460 --> 04:17:35.460
ongoing one year or 16 months series of deep learning

04:17:36.940 --> 04:17:39.380
and all focused on developing

04:17:39.380 --> 04:17:41.700
high quality implementation plans,

04:17:41.700 --> 04:17:44.740
which is ultimately the SPSAs, the CPSAs,

04:17:44.780 --> 04:17:47.380
but how those are aligned to the specific needs

04:17:47.380 --> 04:17:48.660
that exist within the system

04:17:48.660 --> 04:17:53.140
and the reason for which they were eligible for CSI support.

04:17:53.140 --> 04:17:55.620
And that work is designed to build the capacity

04:17:55.620 --> 04:17:57.420
to use improvement science tools

04:17:57.420 --> 04:18:00.620
and ultimately move into deep implementation

04:18:00.620 --> 04:18:02.580
of their evidence-based interventions

04:18:02.580 --> 04:18:04.260
as it relates to their areas of needs

04:18:04.260 --> 04:18:06.500
within their local context.

04:18:06.500 --> 04:18:09.420
The model that we employ in this deeper learning work

04:18:09.420 --> 04:18:12.860
is a model around improvement cohorts.

04:18:12.860 --> 04:18:15.580
The focus initially is on strategic planning

04:18:15.580 --> 04:18:17.540
and I'll get into more specific around that

04:18:17.540 --> 04:18:19.260
on the next slide.

04:18:19.260 --> 04:18:22.180
Our model consists of embedded professional learning

04:18:22.180 --> 04:18:25.500
as well as coaching support for continuous improvement

04:18:25.500 --> 04:18:29.620
and then the third prong here is how do you develop

04:18:29.620 --> 04:18:32.420
the school site leadership's teams capacity

04:18:32.420 --> 04:18:35.460
and the central office together, right?

04:18:35.460 --> 04:18:37.660
And we heard in the previous presentation

04:18:37.660 --> 04:18:39.900
and even in Lindsay's opening

04:18:39.900 --> 04:18:41.380
that the notion around alignment

04:18:41.420 --> 04:18:44.100
and the importance of how the school's planning

04:18:44.100 --> 04:18:46.660
and the processes and their priorities

04:18:46.660 --> 04:18:49.620
and their initiatives, how do those nest within the LCAP

04:18:49.620 --> 04:18:52.580
and the district's overarching vision and equity focus?

04:18:52.580 --> 04:18:56.740
And so we try very hard not to have within systems

04:18:56.740 --> 04:18:58.780
multiple different plans that might be leading folks

04:18:58.780 --> 04:19:00.180
in different directions.

04:19:00.180 --> 04:19:03.740
So we really try to, throughout this deeper learning work

04:19:03.740 --> 04:19:05.860
in all of our work, but in particular this work,

04:19:05.860 --> 04:19:08.540
to align initiatives and priorities and braid them

04:19:08.540 --> 04:19:10.260
so that they're in support of one another

04:19:10.340 --> 04:19:11.740
and not becoming obstacles.

04:19:12.820 --> 04:19:13.780
Next slide, please.

04:19:15.220 --> 04:19:17.620
So the components of this deeper learning work

04:19:17.620 --> 04:19:21.260
and ongoing continuous improvement has,

04:19:21.260 --> 04:19:23.020
I'm gonna address five components here.

04:19:23.020 --> 04:19:25.700
Number one, the structured professional learning series.

04:19:25.700 --> 04:19:29.140
This is where we do deeper work with our WestEd partners

04:19:29.140 --> 04:19:31.060
and other partners that we might engage

04:19:31.060 --> 04:19:32.460
in the professional learning.

04:19:32.460 --> 04:19:35.380
So we are teaching the principles of improvement science,

04:19:35.380 --> 04:19:39.260
bringing in implementation science notions as well,

04:19:39.300 --> 04:19:41.860
focusing on how to conduct root cause,

04:19:41.860 --> 04:19:45.300
thinking about robust needs assessment,

04:19:45.300 --> 04:19:47.660
how do we identify those resource inequities

04:19:47.660 --> 04:19:49.460
that exist within the system.

04:19:49.460 --> 04:19:52.940
And these are structured in our first cohort model

04:19:52.940 --> 04:19:54.980
when we were not in a virtual space,

04:19:54.980 --> 04:19:56.620
these would be all day sessions

04:19:56.620 --> 04:19:58.460
where there'd be about a half day of content

04:19:58.460 --> 04:20:01.300
and then within that day planning time

04:20:01.300 --> 04:20:02.580
for the individual school teams

04:20:02.580 --> 04:20:04.180
with their district partners.

04:20:04.180 --> 04:20:06.940
Now we transition into doing it in a virtual space

04:20:06.940 --> 04:20:09.420
and we're conducting these in shorter chunks of time,

04:20:09.420 --> 04:20:11.380
more like two or two and a half hour sessions

04:20:11.380 --> 04:20:12.940
with a little more frequency.

04:20:14.220 --> 04:20:17.460
Following each professional learning opportunity,

04:20:17.460 --> 04:20:19.420
there are what we call action periods.

04:20:19.420 --> 04:20:20.780
This is where the school level teams

04:20:20.780 --> 04:20:23.100
and their district partners are going back into the field

04:20:23.100 --> 04:20:25.900
and potentially maybe doing conducting things

04:20:25.900 --> 04:20:29.340
like empathy interviews or collecting additional data.

04:20:29.340 --> 04:20:31.340
But it's all predicated on the work that was done

04:20:31.340 --> 04:20:33.740
in the professional learning session

04:20:33.740 --> 04:20:35.580
and the action planning that occurred.

04:20:35.580 --> 04:20:38.620
And then this is where the school level work is happening,

04:20:38.620 --> 04:20:39.740
right, those next steps,

04:20:39.740 --> 04:20:41.740
whether it's around getting more information

04:20:41.740 --> 04:20:43.700
or beginning to test out ideas,

04:20:44.900 --> 04:20:46.540
professional development that might be happening

04:20:46.540 --> 04:20:49.100
for the staff and so on.

04:20:49.100 --> 04:20:50.980
During those action periods,

04:20:50.980 --> 04:20:53.220
we don't leave it just up to the schools or the districts,

04:20:53.220 --> 04:20:54.660
they're not on their own.

04:20:54.660 --> 04:20:57.020
We have a coaching support cycle

04:20:57.020 --> 04:20:58.660
where during the action periods,

04:20:58.660 --> 04:21:00.780
we reach out on an every other week basis

04:21:00.780 --> 04:21:03.100
and conduct a one hour coaching session

04:21:03.100 --> 04:21:06.100
with the school team and their district sponsor

04:21:06.100 --> 04:21:09.580
so that we're getting a sense of how it's working for them,

04:21:09.580 --> 04:21:11.220
where are they encountering challenges,

04:21:11.220 --> 04:21:13.740
where might they need some support or thought partnering

04:21:13.740 --> 04:21:16.180
and obviously to share their successes too, right?

04:21:16.180 --> 04:21:18.420
We're not presuming that things are not going well,

04:21:18.420 --> 04:21:21.660
but we want to be there to help drive the work

04:21:21.660 --> 04:21:24.100
and ensure that their needs are met

04:21:24.100 --> 04:21:26.780
and if needed, additional support could be leveraged

04:21:26.780 --> 04:21:28.820
on our behalf or on West Ed's behalf

04:21:28.820 --> 04:21:31.260
depending upon what's needed in that local context.

04:21:32.260 --> 04:21:35.620
Another component is the plan to study act cycle.

04:21:35.620 --> 04:21:38.100
So we've mentioned the improvement work we heard

04:21:38.100 --> 04:21:39.700
in the previous presentation

04:21:39.700 --> 04:21:42.060
of the principles of improvement science.

04:21:42.060 --> 04:21:46.380
So our schools do take on change ideas.

04:21:46.380 --> 04:21:48.940
They vet these by trying them out

04:21:48.940 --> 04:21:50.660
and testing different approaches,

04:21:50.660 --> 04:21:52.660
determining what works and in many ways,

04:21:52.660 --> 04:21:54.820
this mirrors the differentiated assistance process.

04:21:54.820 --> 04:21:58.380
We just think about it scaled down to the school level.

04:21:58.380 --> 04:22:00.260
Could even be within a three level team

04:22:00.260 --> 04:22:02.780
or within a department, a content area,

04:22:02.780 --> 04:22:04.420
again, depending what the need is

04:22:04.420 --> 04:22:06.740
and how the school was eligible for the support

04:22:06.740 --> 04:22:09.220
and the focus areas that they're digging into,

04:22:09.220 --> 04:22:11.140
whether it's around specific student groups

04:22:11.140 --> 04:22:14.100
or whatever it might be.

04:22:15.300 --> 04:22:16.980
And all of that then is in service

04:22:16.980 --> 04:22:19.540
of building out a strong implementation plan

04:22:19.540 --> 04:22:23.820
so that over time, this plan that the work

04:22:23.820 --> 04:22:26.340
that they engaged in doesn't become short term

04:22:26.340 --> 04:22:28.340
and in the next year, they move on to something else.

04:22:28.340 --> 04:22:31.460
We have a recognition that from a strategic planning

04:22:31.460 --> 04:22:33.220
and from an improvement perspective,

04:22:33.220 --> 04:22:37.260
that this needs to be deep, ongoing, sustainable work

04:22:37.260 --> 04:22:40.020
and have to build capacity for the folks to do that work.

04:22:40.020 --> 04:22:42.740
So our focus in the deeper learning

04:22:42.740 --> 04:22:46.300
is truly around not just technical assistance,

04:22:46.300 --> 04:22:50.500
but going deep and ensuring that what is taken on

04:22:50.500 --> 04:22:52.820
gets implemented, implemented over time

04:22:52.820 --> 04:22:56.180
and adjusted as needed so that the monitoring,

04:22:56.180 --> 04:22:57.740
the evaluation of the effectiveness

04:22:57.740 --> 04:22:59.380
and those other components come in

04:22:59.380 --> 04:23:01.220
during that implementation phase.

04:23:01.220 --> 04:23:02.860
And we, with our West End partners,

04:23:02.860 --> 04:23:05.500
are supporting the schools and the districts

04:23:05.500 --> 04:23:08.260
in building their expertise and their knowledge

04:23:08.260 --> 04:23:11.460
and practice around ongoing monitoring and evaluation.

04:23:12.740 --> 04:23:17.140
So with that, I think we have one more slide.

04:23:17.140 --> 04:23:19.020
We don't have our district partners with us today,

04:23:19.020 --> 04:23:21.300
but we do have a couple of testimonials.

04:23:21.300 --> 04:23:23.300
This first one is from Brian Sheehy,

04:23:23.300 --> 04:23:24.300
who's the project director

04:23:24.300 --> 04:23:26.460
for King Chavez Neighborhood of Schools.

04:23:26.500 --> 04:23:28.020
We work both with charter schools

04:23:28.020 --> 04:23:30.780
and schools within our typical LEAs.

04:23:30.780 --> 04:23:32.740
And I don't want to read this to you,

04:23:32.740 --> 04:23:37.740
but Brian is basically expressing the impact of the work,

04:23:38.580 --> 04:23:40.900
not only having content experts at the table,

04:23:40.900 --> 04:23:42.580
such as those folks from West End,

04:23:42.580 --> 04:23:44.580
but we plug them into additional resources

04:23:44.580 --> 04:23:46.700
that may be needed based on their local context

04:23:46.700 --> 04:23:48.140
and their area of focus.

04:23:48.140 --> 04:23:50.460
And ensuring what I appreciate in this statement

04:23:50.460 --> 04:23:52.220
is developing the engaging

04:23:52.220 --> 04:23:55.100
and relevant professional development.

04:23:55.100 --> 04:23:58.300
We cater to the needs of the local context.

04:23:58.300 --> 04:24:00.780
So we're working around their areas

04:24:00.780 --> 04:24:02.460
where they need support,

04:24:02.460 --> 04:24:05.700
where the needs assessment has driven the work,

04:24:05.700 --> 04:24:08.540
and ensuring that they own the work

04:24:08.540 --> 04:24:10.660
and that we are there in support.

04:24:10.660 --> 04:24:12.420
And so the building of those relationships,

04:24:12.420 --> 04:24:14.380
as we heard earlier, is critical,

04:24:14.380 --> 04:24:16.060
and we don't want them to feel

04:24:16.060 --> 04:24:17.580
like we're doing this to them.

04:24:17.580 --> 04:24:20.620
It is their work, and we're in support of their work.

04:24:21.820 --> 04:24:23.980
And our next testimonial we're excited about,

04:24:23.980 --> 04:24:27.740
we signed on with San Diego Unified,

04:24:27.740 --> 04:24:30.060
so this is a quote from Rebecca Penn.

04:24:30.060 --> 04:24:31.780
In terms of what they're hoping to get,

04:24:31.780 --> 04:24:35.140
we just had our kind of an initial launch

04:24:35.140 --> 04:24:37.860
with the district central office team last week

04:24:37.860 --> 04:24:39.660
to start to outline the work.

04:24:39.660 --> 04:24:41.540
But really, again, what you see here

04:24:41.540 --> 04:24:44.340
is the notion around aligning school level work

04:24:44.340 --> 04:24:46.220
with the larger district work

04:24:46.220 --> 04:24:49.460
and the focus of equity and the LCAP,

04:24:49.460 --> 04:24:51.500
strengthening needs assessment processes

04:24:51.500 --> 04:24:52.660
at the school level,

04:24:52.660 --> 04:24:55.500
developing collaborative structures

04:24:55.500 --> 04:24:59.020
for testing out ideas and designing interventions,

04:24:59.020 --> 04:25:02.740
and the other bullet there around system mapping.

04:25:02.740 --> 04:25:04.540
As you can imagine, in a larger system

04:25:04.540 --> 04:25:07.140
like San Diego Unified, there are a lot of moving parts

04:25:07.140 --> 04:25:08.220
and a lot of moving pieces,

04:25:08.220 --> 04:25:11.220
so the central office team is really looking forward

04:25:11.220 --> 04:25:13.860
to unpacking that,

04:25:13.860 --> 04:25:15.220
it's more thinking about the schools

04:25:15.220 --> 04:25:16.540
that are eligible for the support

04:25:16.540 --> 04:25:21.460
and how can they streamline and map things together

04:25:22.460 --> 04:25:26.220
so that they don't feel like a buffet

04:25:26.220 --> 04:25:27.540
of many different things that happen,

04:25:27.540 --> 04:25:29.740
but that it is a well planned out

04:25:29.740 --> 04:25:34.060
and well thought out strategic effort of improvement.

04:25:34.060 --> 04:25:35.540
So I thank you for your time.

04:25:35.540 --> 04:25:36.580
I know you've had a long day

04:25:36.580 --> 04:25:38.620
and you're probably two or three hours behind,

04:25:38.620 --> 04:25:41.260
but thank you for this opportunity to share,

04:25:41.260 --> 04:25:43.980
and yeah, we're proud of our work

04:25:43.980 --> 04:25:46.260
and happy to be in support of our students

04:25:46.260 --> 04:25:47.900
in San Diego County.

04:25:48.900 --> 04:25:49.740
Thank you.

04:25:49.740 --> 04:25:54.740
Well, thank you, Laura, Tyler, Stephen, and Patricia.

04:25:54.820 --> 04:25:59.140
So to wrap up this presentation portion of this item,

04:25:59.140 --> 04:26:02.020
the CD recommends that the State Board of Education

04:26:02.020 --> 04:26:04.740
take action to approve the CSI plans

04:26:04.740 --> 04:26:06.820
for the 2020-21 school year,

04:26:06.820 --> 04:26:10.340
including attachment one and the addendum of this item.

04:26:10.340 --> 04:26:13.300
Terrific, thank you, and it's really nice to hear

04:26:13.300 --> 04:26:17.380
about the ways in which this process is supportive

04:26:17.380 --> 04:26:19.020
and feeling helpful and useful

04:26:19.020 --> 04:26:21.300
to the schools that are a part of it.

04:26:22.180 --> 04:26:24.740
At this point, we want to open up the phone line

04:26:24.740 --> 04:26:26.860
for public comment queue,

04:26:26.860 --> 04:26:30.580
and put the public comments slide up if we could.

04:26:30.580 --> 04:26:31.420
Thank you.

04:26:32.340 --> 04:26:35.060
Members of the public wishing to provide public comment

04:26:35.060 --> 04:26:37.420
can do so by calling this number

04:26:37.420 --> 04:26:40.220
and entering the access code shown here.

04:26:40.220 --> 04:26:42.140
And while we're waiting for members of the public

04:26:42.140 --> 04:26:45.020
to call in, I want to first ask Member Burr

04:26:45.020 --> 04:26:46.180
and Vice President Strauss

04:26:46.180 --> 04:26:48.580
if they have any initial comments.

04:26:51.500 --> 04:26:54.620
Well, I'll start and then leave most of the comments

04:26:54.620 --> 04:26:56.980
to Eileen, because this is so near and dear

04:26:56.980 --> 04:26:59.300
her heart and her work.

04:26:59.300 --> 04:27:02.580
I'll just say that I both really appreciate

04:27:02.580 --> 04:27:04.580
Lindsay's comprehensive overview

04:27:04.580 --> 04:27:07.660
of what this process looks like at the state level,

04:27:08.580 --> 04:27:10.340
but especially appreciate hearing

04:27:10.340 --> 04:27:13.620
from our County Offices of Education,

04:27:13.620 --> 04:27:16.020
who, as you know, are our key partners

04:27:16.020 --> 04:27:19.260
in implementing this work at the local level.

04:27:19.260 --> 04:27:22.500
I think both Marin and San Diego provided

04:27:22.500 --> 04:27:27.100
really good illustrations really of how in touch they are

04:27:27.100 --> 04:27:29.620
with their schools and their communities

04:27:29.620 --> 04:27:32.580
and how they leverage that and providing the assistance

04:27:32.580 --> 04:27:35.380
that those LEAs and schools need.

04:27:35.380 --> 04:27:37.420
So I'll stop with that and just say

04:27:37.420 --> 04:27:39.100
I support the recommendation

04:27:39.100 --> 04:27:41.660
and look forward to hearing from Eileen.

04:27:42.620 --> 04:27:43.980
Great.

04:27:43.980 --> 04:27:45.300
Oh, thank you.

04:27:45.300 --> 04:27:46.820
So let me just say to Lindsay

04:27:46.820 --> 04:27:50.020
and the entire team from Marin and San Diego,

04:27:50.020 --> 04:27:51.860
what I appreciate about the presentation

04:27:51.860 --> 04:27:54.060
is we're looking at policy to practice.

04:27:54.060 --> 04:27:58.700
So what is our policy and how does it roll out

04:27:58.700 --> 04:28:01.420
to the counties who support us, who said,

04:28:01.420 --> 04:28:03.780
and then to the districts who receive the implementation.

04:28:03.780 --> 04:28:05.900
And so what I think the presentation did

04:28:05.900 --> 04:28:10.300
was help add some details to what the structure is

04:28:10.300 --> 04:28:12.900
and particularly highlighting how important

04:28:12.900 --> 04:28:15.580
is the context for the local school matters.

04:28:15.580 --> 04:28:18.100
So particularly in the San Rafael situation

04:28:18.100 --> 04:28:20.420
where it's an alternative school setting,

04:28:20.420 --> 04:28:21.860
with the first example,

04:28:21.860 --> 04:28:23.820
and what the difference is for the students

04:28:23.820 --> 04:28:25.580
who end up in alternative ed

04:28:25.580 --> 04:28:28.660
as a result of a system that structures.

04:28:28.660 --> 04:28:31.780
So I so appreciated the understanding about context

04:28:31.780 --> 04:28:33.660
and about the issue of the equity lens

04:28:33.660 --> 04:28:34.940
and the equity audit,

04:28:34.940 --> 04:28:36.540
particularly interviews with students,

04:28:36.540 --> 04:28:37.660
because I think what we've learned

04:28:37.660 --> 04:28:39.700
is if you listen to students and talk with them,

04:28:39.700 --> 04:28:41.660
you really gain a deeper knowledge

04:28:41.660 --> 04:28:44.180
about how the system is really impacting them

04:28:44.180 --> 04:28:48.340
and how it impacts them as they engage

04:28:48.340 --> 04:28:50.660
with our system as well.

04:28:50.660 --> 04:28:54.300
I do think the coaching support that was highlighted

04:28:54.300 --> 04:28:57.740
in the San Diego plan was really helpful.

04:28:57.740 --> 04:29:00.380
I would just say as someone who's involved in working

04:29:00.380 --> 04:29:02.780
and coaching with districts and schools,

04:29:02.780 --> 04:29:05.660
I think we do lay out a foundation first

04:29:05.660 --> 04:29:08.740
through improvement science, through continuous improvement.

04:29:08.740 --> 04:29:12.580
But as you coach and differentiate for the local sites

04:29:12.580 --> 04:29:14.420
and the leaders who are at those sites,

04:29:14.420 --> 04:29:16.780
that's where you get the specific support

04:29:16.780 --> 04:29:18.940
and strategic intervention.

04:29:18.940 --> 04:29:21.580
And so again, I support the recommendations,

04:29:21.580 --> 04:29:25.300
but particularly appreciate the entire team approach

04:29:25.300 --> 04:29:27.820
for what does our system of support look like?

04:29:27.820 --> 04:29:29.700
What's the role of the county office?

04:29:29.700 --> 04:29:31.300
What's the role of the district?

04:29:31.300 --> 04:29:33.420
And how does it impact the school,

04:29:33.420 --> 04:29:34.860
both the leaders at the school

04:29:34.860 --> 04:29:36.700
and the teachers at the school?

04:29:36.700 --> 04:29:39.580
So again, I think we saw some really specifics

04:29:39.580 --> 04:29:41.140
and I look forward to hearing the comments

04:29:41.140 --> 04:29:43.340
from the public and from board members.

04:29:43.340 --> 04:29:44.580
Thank you.

04:29:44.580 --> 04:29:45.740
Terrific.

04:29:45.740 --> 04:29:47.860
Are there any clarifying questions

04:29:47.860 --> 04:29:51.340
on the specific facts that were presented?

04:29:51.340 --> 04:29:53.380
We'll come back to the board for discussion

04:29:53.380 --> 04:29:54.740
after public comment.

04:29:56.780 --> 04:29:58.980
Seeing no hands on that,

04:29:58.980 --> 04:30:01.900
let's go to public comment if we have some.

04:30:01.900 --> 04:30:04.220
Okay, there are a few callers in the queue

04:30:04.220 --> 04:30:05.700
for item number five.

04:30:05.700 --> 04:30:07.260
I will open the phone line now.

04:30:09.540 --> 04:30:10.740
Good afternoon, caller.

04:30:10.740 --> 04:30:12.860
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:30:12.860 --> 04:30:13.700
You have one minute.

04:30:13.700 --> 04:30:14.820
Your time starts now.

04:30:16.020 --> 04:30:17.020
Yes, good afternoon.

04:30:17.020 --> 04:30:18.820
Elizabeth Guian with Public Advocates

04:30:18.820 --> 04:30:21.860
and for the LCFS Equity Coalition.

04:30:21.860 --> 04:30:24.620
We complained last year about this process.

04:30:24.620 --> 04:30:27.620
We believe that federal law requires the board

04:30:27.620 --> 04:30:31.700
to approve these plans with a much higher expectation

04:30:31.740 --> 04:30:35.740
than the tiered box checking that is currently happening.

04:30:35.740 --> 04:30:37.940
We would like to see a future agenda item

04:30:37.940 --> 04:30:40.300
to really discuss how the system of support

04:30:40.300 --> 04:30:44.220
is meeting this obligation to our needy of students.

04:30:44.220 --> 04:30:46.540
The notion that schools are a traumatizer

04:30:46.540 --> 04:30:50.340
is unfortunately very true for our struggling communities.

04:30:50.340 --> 04:30:52.860
All one needs to do is try and participate

04:30:52.860 --> 04:30:54.660
in a school site CPSA process

04:30:54.660 --> 04:30:57.540
and then try to align it with the district's LCAP.

04:30:57.540 --> 04:30:59.860
We appreciate the commitment shared by Lindsay

04:30:59.900 --> 04:31:02.100
and her colleagues from the county offices

04:31:02.100 --> 04:31:04.660
and we agree with the alignment of ESSA requirements

04:31:04.660 --> 04:31:07.380
to the one LCAP planning process,

04:31:07.380 --> 04:31:09.700
but teaching someone to fish looks very different

04:31:09.700 --> 04:31:13.700
when the reality is between fishing in a stagnant pond

04:31:13.700 --> 04:31:16.580
versus fishing in a healthy, free-flowing river

04:31:16.580 --> 04:31:19.980
and the fishing guides are committed to meaningful improvement.

04:31:19.980 --> 04:31:23.180
It appears that Marin County has only CSI schools.

04:31:24.180 --> 04:31:27.020
Compare that to 136 in LA County.

04:31:27.020 --> 04:31:28.140
Time.

04:31:28.140 --> 04:31:30.700
We think that that...

04:31:30.700 --> 04:31:31.700
Thank you, caller.

04:31:35.580 --> 04:31:36.420
Good afternoon.

04:31:36.420 --> 04:31:38.220
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:31:38.220 --> 04:31:39.060
You have one minute.

04:31:39.060 --> 04:31:40.220
Your time starts now.

04:31:41.900 --> 04:31:42.740
Good afternoon.

04:31:42.740 --> 04:31:45.220
My name is Lexi Lopez on behalf of Ed Voice.

04:31:45.220 --> 04:31:47.340
First, we wanted to extend our congratulations

04:31:47.340 --> 04:31:49.980
to our re-elected board president, Darlene Hammond,

04:31:49.980 --> 04:31:52.020
and vice president Strauss.

04:31:52.020 --> 04:31:54.100
As is expressed in the Alliance for Students' Letter,

04:31:54.100 --> 04:31:55.940
our coalition strongly urges the board

04:31:55.980 --> 04:31:58.700
to direct the department to pursue a more thorough review

04:31:58.700 --> 04:32:01.940
of the CSI plans and to administratively strengthen

04:32:01.940 --> 04:32:05.220
the guidance to the COEs to use in their approval process

04:32:05.220 --> 04:32:07.180
for this portion of the LCAPs.

04:32:07.180 --> 04:32:09.140
If necessary, the department and the board

04:32:09.140 --> 04:32:11.820
should pursue a legislative budget change proposal

04:32:11.820 --> 04:32:13.540
to redirect state set-aside funds

04:32:13.540 --> 04:32:15.700
to ensure that this important oversight

04:32:15.700 --> 04:32:18.100
and analysis actually takes place.

04:32:18.100 --> 04:32:20.580
Furthermore, we request a further agenda item

04:32:20.580 --> 04:32:22.780
to discuss how the system of support

04:32:22.780 --> 04:32:25.180
is meeting the federal education obligation

04:32:25.260 --> 04:32:26.780
to our neediest students.

04:32:26.780 --> 04:32:28.820
Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

04:32:34.300 --> 04:32:35.140
Good afternoon.

04:32:35.140 --> 04:32:36.940
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:32:36.940 --> 04:32:37.780
You have one minute.

04:32:37.780 --> 04:32:38.820
Your time starts now.

04:32:40.580 --> 04:32:41.420
Good afternoon.

04:32:41.420 --> 04:32:43.820
Jessica Sacco on behalf of Children Now.

04:32:43.820 --> 04:32:45.420
I'm affirming our alignment with the concerns

04:32:45.420 --> 04:32:48.300
and requests outlined in the LCFF coalition letter

04:32:48.300 --> 04:32:49.460
on this item.

04:32:49.460 --> 04:32:51.180
I really appreciate the presentation today

04:32:51.180 --> 04:32:53.460
that outlined the process at the state level

04:32:53.460 --> 04:32:55.260
as well as the two guest presentations

04:32:55.260 --> 04:32:56.780
from Marin and San Diego,

04:32:56.780 --> 04:32:59.540
which helped shed a light on this process,

04:32:59.540 --> 04:33:00.740
at least as it's taking place

04:33:00.740 --> 04:33:03.420
in two counties of our 58 counties.

04:33:03.420 --> 04:33:06.380
In the end, my comments are very similar

04:33:06.380 --> 04:33:07.540
to the prior speaker.

04:33:07.540 --> 04:33:10.060
We urge the board to pursue a more direct review

04:33:10.060 --> 04:33:13.300
of the CSI plans and also to administratively strengthen

04:33:13.300 --> 04:33:14.860
the guidance to county offices

04:33:14.860 --> 04:33:16.860
to use in their approval process

04:33:16.860 --> 04:33:19.180
for the CSI portion of the LCAP.

04:33:19.180 --> 04:33:21.380
And in addition, we request a future agenda item

04:33:21.380 --> 04:33:23.380
to discuss how the system to support

04:33:23.380 --> 04:33:26.220
is meeting its federal obligations under ESSA

04:33:26.220 --> 04:33:28.420
in order to serve our most needed students.

04:33:28.420 --> 04:33:29.260
Thank you.

04:33:29.260 --> 04:33:30.420
Thank you.

04:33:30.420 --> 04:33:32.980
That concludes public comment for item number five.

04:33:35.700 --> 04:33:37.980
All right, given that there's no more public comment,

04:33:37.980 --> 04:33:40.100
we will open for board discussions.

04:33:41.420 --> 04:33:46.100
Please raise your hand in the participant menu

04:33:46.100 --> 04:33:49.300
if you would like to make a comment or have a question.

04:33:51.380 --> 04:33:56.380
All right, seeing none, I will see if there is a motion.

04:34:06.860 --> 04:34:07.980
I would like to make a motion

04:34:07.980 --> 04:34:09.940
to approve the department recommendation

04:34:09.940 --> 04:34:13.100
to approve the CSI plans for 2021.

04:34:14.260 --> 04:34:15.340
Do I have a second?

04:34:15.340 --> 04:34:16.180
I second it.

04:34:17.180 --> 04:34:18.820
All right, any further discussion?

04:34:19.820 --> 04:34:22.500
All in favor of the motion, say it.

04:34:22.500 --> 04:34:23.940
Oh, we need to do a roll call.

04:34:23.940 --> 04:34:25.660
Brooks, can you do the roll call?

04:34:25.660 --> 04:34:26.820
Of course.

04:34:26.820 --> 04:34:27.660
Member Son.

04:34:28.860 --> 04:34:30.300
Aye.

04:34:30.300 --> 04:34:32.220
Vice President Strauss.

04:34:32.220 --> 04:34:33.420
Aye.

04:34:33.420 --> 04:34:34.260
Member Rucker.

04:34:35.140 --> 04:34:36.500
Aye.

04:34:36.500 --> 04:34:37.340
Member Rodriguez.

04:34:39.100 --> 04:34:40.300
Aye.

04:34:40.300 --> 04:34:41.460
Member Patil-Brownson.

04:34:42.860 --> 04:34:43.980
Yes.

04:34:43.980 --> 04:34:44.820
Member Navo.

04:34:45.660 --> 04:34:46.700
Aye.

04:34:46.700 --> 04:34:47.540
Member McQuillan.

04:34:49.020 --> 04:34:50.100
Yes.

04:34:50.100 --> 04:34:51.180
Member Glover-Woods.

04:34:52.700 --> 04:34:53.780
Aye.

04:34:53.780 --> 04:34:54.620
Member Fatah.

04:34:55.540 --> 04:34:56.740
Aye.

04:34:56.740 --> 04:34:58.820
President Darlene Hammond.

04:34:58.820 --> 04:35:00.060
Aye.

04:35:00.060 --> 04:35:01.660
Member Burr.

04:35:01.660 --> 04:35:02.900
Aye.

04:35:02.900 --> 04:35:03.740
That's unanimous.

04:35:05.820 --> 04:35:06.660
All right, thank you.

04:35:06.660 --> 04:35:10.860
And I just want to thank our staff at the board

04:35:10.860 --> 04:35:13.980
and members of the county offices and schools who spoke,

04:35:13.980 --> 04:35:18.500
but also the folks from the LCFF coalition

04:35:19.180 --> 04:35:21.060
and others who offered public comment

04:35:21.060 --> 04:35:24.540
and who will take under advisement the opportunity

04:35:24.540 --> 04:35:28.340
to have a deeper discussion about these plans.

04:35:28.340 --> 04:35:29.780
Thank you.

04:35:29.780 --> 04:35:31.420
At this point, I think we should go ahead

04:35:31.420 --> 04:35:34.340
and give ourselves a little break

04:35:34.340 --> 04:35:36.660
because the next item is a long one.

04:35:36.660 --> 04:35:38.620
So I have 1.57.

04:35:38.620 --> 04:35:40.940
Let's give ourselves a 13 minute break

04:35:40.940 --> 04:35:43.980
and come back at 2.10 and we'll see you then.

04:35:43.980 --> 04:35:45.860
Get some coffee or whatever you need.

04:35:48.660 --> 04:35:52.940
Don't forget to turn off your sound and video,

04:35:52.940 --> 04:35:55.420
but don't leave the virtual.

04:35:59.140 --> 04:36:00.820
Back.

04:36:00.820 --> 04:36:04.340
We are gonna move on to agenda item number six,

04:36:04.340 --> 04:36:07.580
which is the Comprehensive Literacy State Development Grant,

04:36:08.580 --> 04:36:11.420
the State Literacy Plan Draft Review,

04:36:11.420 --> 04:36:14.500
and the CDE recommends that the state board.

04:36:14.500 --> 04:36:15.340
I'm very sorry. Yes.

04:36:15.340 --> 04:36:17.700
We just need to reestablish a quorum.

04:36:17.780 --> 04:36:18.780
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:36:18.780 --> 04:36:20.140
Please reestablish a quorum.

04:36:20.140 --> 04:36:20.980
Yes.

04:36:21.980 --> 04:36:22.820
Member Sun.

04:36:23.980 --> 04:36:25.180
Here.

04:36:25.180 --> 04:36:27.140
Vice President Strauss.

04:36:27.140 --> 04:36:27.980
Here.

04:36:27.980 --> 04:36:28.820
Member Rucker.

04:36:30.300 --> 04:36:31.300
Here.

04:36:31.300 --> 04:36:32.340
Member Rodriguez.

04:36:33.300 --> 04:36:34.140
Here.

04:36:34.140 --> 04:36:35.300
Member Patil Brownson.

04:36:36.220 --> 04:36:37.060
Here.

04:36:37.060 --> 04:36:38.460
Member Navo.

04:36:38.460 --> 04:36:39.300
Here.

04:36:39.300 --> 04:36:40.260
Member McQuillan.

04:36:41.380 --> 04:36:42.220
Here.

04:36:42.220 --> 04:36:43.220
Member Glover-Woods.

04:36:44.500 --> 04:36:45.340
Here.

04:36:45.340 --> 04:36:47.020
Member Fatah.

04:36:47.020 --> 04:36:47.860
Here.

04:36:47.860 --> 04:36:49.540
President Darlene Hammond.

04:36:49.540 --> 04:36:50.380
Here.

04:36:50.380 --> 04:36:51.860
Member Burr.

04:36:51.860 --> 04:36:52.700
Here.

04:36:52.700 --> 04:36:53.820
Everyone's present?

04:36:53.820 --> 04:36:55.700
Quorum's established.

04:36:55.700 --> 04:36:56.980
All right.

04:36:56.980 --> 04:37:01.060
So we're gonna move on to agenda item number six,

04:37:01.060 --> 04:37:04.180
in which the CDE recommends the state board review

04:37:04.180 --> 04:37:08.860
the draft state literacy plan and provide feedback.

04:37:08.860 --> 04:37:12.140
This is not an action item, it's an information item.

04:37:12.140 --> 04:37:14.340
The draft state literacy plan is available

04:37:14.420 --> 04:37:19.180
on the CDE webpage, and you have that link there.

04:37:19.180 --> 04:37:23.180
This item will be presented by Barbara Murchison of the CDE.

04:37:23.180 --> 04:37:24.460
Barbara, please begin.

04:37:28.100 --> 04:37:29.700
All right.

04:37:29.700 --> 04:37:30.700
Thanks, everyone.

04:37:30.700 --> 04:37:32.500
Good afternoon, President Darlene Hammond,

04:37:32.500 --> 04:37:35.060
Chief Deputy Gregson, board members.

04:37:35.060 --> 04:37:36.060
I'm Barbara Murchison,

04:37:36.060 --> 04:37:38.900
Director of the Educator Excellence and Equity Division

04:37:38.900 --> 04:37:40.780
here at the CDE.

04:37:40.780 --> 04:37:43.820
Today, it is my pleasure to present to you for feedback,

04:37:43.860 --> 04:37:47.460
the draft of California's Comprehensive State Literacy Plan.

04:37:47.460 --> 04:37:48.660
Before I get started,

04:37:48.660 --> 04:37:52.500
I just feel like I need to recognize all of our colleagues

04:37:52.500 --> 04:37:54.340
who are in classrooms right now,

04:37:54.340 --> 04:37:56.900
because setting up this technology

04:37:57.900 --> 04:38:00.420
to be able to do this with multiple laptops

04:38:00.420 --> 04:38:02.940
and iPads and lights, it's a lot.

04:38:02.940 --> 04:38:05.580
So kudos to them who have been figuring,

04:38:05.580 --> 04:38:07.620
who have done this since last March.

04:38:08.780 --> 04:38:13.380
And also I wanna apologize in advance for leaf blowers,

04:38:13.380 --> 04:38:15.140
dog behaviors.

04:38:15.140 --> 04:38:18.020
Who knows what's gonna happen during this presentation.

04:38:18.020 --> 04:38:19.340
Thanks for your patience.

04:38:23.940 --> 04:38:26.780
So as President Darlene Hammond noted,

04:38:26.780 --> 04:38:29.740
we are not asking you to approve this plan today.

04:38:29.740 --> 04:38:32.620
Today, we are seeking your feedback.

04:38:32.620 --> 04:38:34.620
I'm gonna provide an overview of the plan

04:38:34.620 --> 04:38:36.860
and share some information around why

04:38:36.860 --> 04:38:39.020
and how we've developed it.

04:38:39.020 --> 04:38:41.900
And we intend to bring this plan back to you for approval

04:38:41.900 --> 04:38:44.140
at your next meeting in March.

04:38:47.140 --> 04:38:48.540
So California applied

04:38:48.540 --> 04:38:51.820
for the Federal Comprehensive Literacy State Development Grant

04:38:51.820 --> 04:38:54.140
back in June, 2019,

04:38:54.140 --> 04:38:57.340
and was awarded about 37 and a half million dollars

04:38:57.340 --> 04:39:00.380
in September of 2019.

04:39:00.380 --> 04:39:02.820
The primary goal of this federal grant program

04:39:02.820 --> 04:39:06.100
is to improve literacy instruction for children and youth

04:39:06.980 --> 04:39:09.340
age birth through grade 12.

04:39:09.340 --> 04:39:10.740
As part of this program,

04:39:10.740 --> 04:39:12.740
states are asked to develop, revise,

04:39:12.740 --> 04:39:15.740
or update their comprehensive literacy plans.

04:39:15.740 --> 04:39:17.380
The program also allows states

04:39:17.380 --> 04:39:19.060
to provide targeted subgrants

04:39:19.060 --> 04:39:22.340
to local educational agencies or LEAs

04:39:22.340 --> 04:39:24.180
to implement evidence-based programs

04:39:24.180 --> 04:39:26.500
to ensure high quality literacy instruction.

04:39:27.820 --> 04:39:30.340
California's proposal was ratified by the board

04:39:30.340 --> 04:39:34.780
back on consent back in July, 2019,

04:39:34.780 --> 04:39:35.860
but that was a while ago.

04:39:35.860 --> 04:39:38.300
So I'll review our three main objectives

04:39:38.300 --> 04:39:39.700
in the proposal now.

04:39:41.740 --> 04:39:44.220
First, we propose to build state capacity

04:39:44.220 --> 04:39:46.500
to support evidence-based literacy instruction

04:39:46.500 --> 04:39:50.060
by establishing dedicated staff positions within the CDE

04:39:50.060 --> 04:39:53.220
to lead our coordinated effort to build state

04:39:53.220 --> 04:39:56.300
and local capacity over the life of the project.

04:39:56.300 --> 04:39:59.420
These staff have established and maintained structures

04:39:59.420 --> 04:40:02.940
to support ongoing collaboration and information sharing

04:40:02.940 --> 04:40:07.060
around many efforts to support student literacy.

04:40:07.060 --> 04:40:08.500
First, as you can imagine,

04:40:08.740 --> 04:40:11.260
there are many people at the CDE

04:40:11.260 --> 04:40:13.660
beyond the educator excellence and equity division

04:40:13.660 --> 04:40:16.180
who are working to support student literacy

04:40:18.220 --> 04:40:21.820
in offices and divisions all across the department.

04:40:21.820 --> 04:40:24.740
So we've established monthly literacy round tables

04:40:24.740 --> 04:40:27.900
to bring all interested department staff together

04:40:27.900 --> 04:40:30.140
to share updates and identify areas

04:40:30.140 --> 04:40:31.740
of potential collaboration

04:40:31.740 --> 04:40:34.620
around the various literacy initiatives we support.

04:40:35.580 --> 04:40:38.500
We also meet monthly with our key partners

04:40:38.500 --> 04:40:40.180
to share updates and ideas

04:40:40.180 --> 04:40:43.580
around how we can advance student literacy achievement.

04:40:43.580 --> 04:40:45.940
Our partners for the purposes of this grant

04:40:45.940 --> 04:40:48.780
are the California Subject Matter Project,

04:40:48.780 --> 04:40:50.620
the California County Superintendents

04:40:50.620 --> 04:40:53.420
Educational Services Association,

04:40:53.420 --> 04:40:56.660
the Region 15 Comprehensive Center at West Ed,

04:40:56.660 --> 04:40:59.060
and First Five California.

04:40:59.060 --> 04:41:02.180
So I wanna take a minute before I get too far ahead of myself

04:41:02.340 --> 04:41:05.060
to thank all of those CDE colleagues

04:41:05.060 --> 04:41:07.540
and our key partners who over the past year

04:41:07.540 --> 04:41:10.740
have provided feedback on drafts of the plan

04:41:10.740 --> 04:41:12.660
and helped us think through challenges,

04:41:12.660 --> 04:41:15.940
celebrate successes, and really just get the word out

04:41:15.940 --> 04:41:18.180
when the plan was available for public comment

04:41:18.180 --> 04:41:21.900
so they can engage all of their members and stakeholders.

04:41:23.140 --> 04:41:25.580
The CDE staff supporting the literacy grant work

04:41:25.580 --> 04:41:27.140
are gonna have an even greater role

04:41:27.140 --> 04:41:30.940
in coordinating the work of the subgrantees for this grant

04:41:30.980 --> 04:41:33.300
once we move to that stage of implementation

04:41:33.300 --> 04:41:34.340
later this year.

04:41:36.100 --> 04:41:38.780
Second, we propose to develop and implement

04:41:38.780 --> 04:41:42.060
an evidence-based comprehensive state literacy plan

04:41:42.060 --> 04:41:45.060
that aligns and integrates state literacy initiatives,

04:41:45.060 --> 04:41:48.460
content standards, and state guidance documents

04:41:48.460 --> 04:41:51.300
to support teachers supporting children and students

04:41:51.300 --> 04:41:53.220
from birth to grade 12.

04:41:53.220 --> 04:41:56.140
And that plan will be the focus of our time together today.

04:41:57.140 --> 04:42:00.620
Third, we propose to build local capacity

04:42:00.620 --> 04:42:03.020
to establish, align, and implement

04:42:03.020 --> 04:42:05.380
local literacy initiatives

04:42:05.380 --> 04:42:07.820
that emphasize family and community involvement

04:42:07.820 --> 04:42:09.620
to address the needs of California's

04:42:09.620 --> 04:42:11.180
most vulnerable children.

04:42:12.060 --> 04:42:14.980
95% of these literacy grant funds

04:42:14.980 --> 04:42:17.620
will be subgranted to LEAs.

04:42:17.620 --> 04:42:19.980
I'll talk a little bit more about those subgrants

04:42:19.980 --> 04:42:23.380
and how the plan will guide them later in this presentation.

04:42:24.340 --> 04:42:26.740
But before going into additional detail

04:42:26.740 --> 04:42:28.500
about the plan itself,

04:42:28.500 --> 04:42:30.780
I'd like to acknowledge the team

04:42:30.780 --> 04:42:32.340
that helped the CDE develop

04:42:32.340 --> 04:42:35.300
the Statewide Comprehensive Literacy Needs Assessment,

04:42:35.300 --> 04:42:38.580
which served as the foundation to the literacy plan.

04:42:38.580 --> 04:42:42.300
So even before this funding opportunity was announced

04:42:42.300 --> 04:42:44.980
by the United States Department of Education,

04:42:44.980 --> 04:42:47.460
the CDE was starting to think about

04:42:47.460 --> 04:42:49.980
how we could get an assessment together

04:42:49.980 --> 04:42:52.860
that would allow us to complete the plan

04:42:53.740 --> 04:42:56.940
and submit a competitive application for this program.

04:42:56.940 --> 04:42:59.380
And part of that is really taking stock

04:42:59.380 --> 04:43:03.580
of how literacy instruction was happening in California.

04:43:03.580 --> 04:43:07.060
So that needs assessment was developed by the CDE

04:43:07.060 --> 04:43:10.700
in consultation with the American Institutes for Research

04:43:10.700 --> 04:43:13.700
and the Region 15 Comprehensive Center.

04:43:13.700 --> 04:43:16.140
And as part of the development process,

04:43:16.140 --> 04:43:18.980
the CDE sought input from a group of stakeholders

04:43:18.980 --> 04:43:20.940
with expertise in literacy

04:43:20.980 --> 04:43:24.140
before we disseminated the assessment to LEAs

04:43:24.140 --> 04:43:26.260
in December 2019.

04:43:27.380 --> 04:43:28.820
With the help of our colleagues

04:43:28.820 --> 04:43:31.340
at the Region 15 Comprehensive Center,

04:43:31.340 --> 04:43:34.860
this group of individuals, our needs assessment team,

04:43:34.860 --> 04:43:38.900
convened formally in February 2020 to analyze the data

04:43:38.900 --> 04:43:41.340
and provide recommendations to the plan

04:43:41.340 --> 04:43:43.860
based on the results of the needs assessment.

04:43:43.860 --> 04:43:45.660
So the state literacy team,

04:43:45.660 --> 04:43:49.020
we already had a robust set of data

04:43:49.020 --> 04:43:51.260
around the status of literacy instruction

04:43:51.260 --> 04:43:53.700
and how things were going with that around the state

04:43:53.700 --> 04:43:56.340
before we even convened the state literacy team.

04:43:57.940 --> 04:43:59.660
At that same time,

04:44:00.980 --> 04:44:03.540
we were assembling a state literacy team.

04:44:03.540 --> 04:44:05.340
So this group of knowledgeable

04:44:05.340 --> 04:44:08.660
and exceptionally generous individuals

04:44:08.660 --> 04:44:10.660
has played a critical role in our work

04:44:10.660 --> 04:44:12.580
to develop this literacy plan

04:44:12.580 --> 04:44:15.020
into the document that you have before you now.

04:44:16.020 --> 04:44:19.500
In early January 2020,

04:44:19.500 --> 04:44:22.500
it's about a year ago from now,

04:44:22.500 --> 04:44:26.100
the CDE disseminated a statewide call for applications

04:44:26.100 --> 04:44:28.300
for this state literacy team.

04:44:29.180 --> 04:44:31.980
We received 130 applications

04:44:31.980 --> 04:44:33.620
and they were scored by volunteers

04:44:33.620 --> 04:44:36.900
from the CDE literacy roundtables.

04:44:36.900 --> 04:44:38.940
The group used a very detailed rubric

04:44:38.940 --> 04:44:41.300
designed to identify a team of individuals

04:44:41.300 --> 04:44:44.540
from across all geographic areas of California

04:44:44.660 --> 04:44:46.900
with a range of literacy expertise

04:44:46.900 --> 04:44:48.540
from birth through grade 12.

04:44:50.220 --> 04:44:52.700
This process helped to ensure a diverse team

04:44:52.700 --> 04:44:54.020
with additional expertise

04:44:54.020 --> 04:44:56.420
related to special student populations

04:44:57.340 --> 04:44:59.580
in all representing a very broad range

04:44:59.580 --> 04:45:02.460
of California's diverse student populations.

04:45:02.460 --> 04:45:05.540
Ultimately, a group of 35 individuals

04:45:05.540 --> 04:45:08.900
was selected to serve on this team.

04:45:09.900 --> 04:45:11.500
I should note that membership spans

04:45:11.500 --> 04:45:13.340
the California education system,

04:45:13.340 --> 04:45:15.860
including teachers, school district

04:45:15.860 --> 04:45:17.980
and county office leaders,

04:45:17.980 --> 04:45:19.500
and multiple representatives

04:45:19.500 --> 04:45:23.060
with deep literacy expertise from higher education.

04:45:23.060 --> 04:45:25.260
Additionally, one member each

04:45:25.260 --> 04:45:26.940
from the state board of education,

04:45:26.940 --> 04:45:28.700
the commission on teacher credentialing

04:45:28.700 --> 04:45:31.940
and the California collaborative for educational excellence

04:45:31.940 --> 04:45:34.940
were included on the state policy on the team

04:45:34.940 --> 04:45:36.780
so that the state policy perspective

04:45:36.780 --> 04:45:39.220
is well represented there as well.

04:45:40.220 --> 04:45:42.540
A complete list of team members

04:45:42.540 --> 04:45:47.540
is available on the CDE State Literacy Plan Team webpage.

04:45:47.580 --> 04:45:49.860
So yes, they're a very impressive bunch.

04:45:51.620 --> 04:45:56.180
So here we are, we have this amazing state literacy team.

04:45:56.180 --> 04:45:58.620
We have a first skeletal draft of a plan

04:45:58.620 --> 04:46:00.420
that's ready for feedback.

04:46:00.420 --> 04:46:01.940
We have lots of data

04:46:01.940 --> 04:46:05.100
because we've got this state needs assessment

04:46:05.100 --> 04:46:07.620
and we've put together all the CASP data

04:46:08.100 --> 04:46:11.820
and the DRDP data and everything's ready to go.

04:46:11.820 --> 04:46:14.940
We've got recommendations from the needs assessment team.

04:46:14.940 --> 04:46:17.780
We have a robust set of evidence-based strategies

04:46:17.780 --> 04:46:19.420
for the team to consider

04:46:19.420 --> 04:46:21.580
and an agenda to bring everyone together

04:46:21.580 --> 04:46:24.860
for what we know is gonna be a very busy two-day meeting

04:46:24.860 --> 04:46:27.820
to work on the first draft of the plan

04:46:27.820 --> 04:46:31.820
on March 23rd and 24th.

04:46:32.980 --> 04:46:34.660
You see where this is going, right?

04:46:34.660 --> 04:46:36.820
Travel arrangements are made.

04:46:37.700 --> 04:46:39.740
The lunches are ordered.

04:46:39.740 --> 04:46:42.500
The space is reserved.

04:46:42.500 --> 04:46:47.060
So here is where I need to share my very deep gratitude

04:46:47.060 --> 04:46:49.380
to all involved for their flexibility

04:46:49.380 --> 04:46:51.220
for that first meeting.

04:46:51.220 --> 04:46:54.780
Like everyone else in the education world,

04:46:54.780 --> 04:46:58.220
around the world, CDE staff and our colleagues

04:46:58.220 --> 04:47:01.500
at the Comprehensive Center had to turn on a dime

04:47:01.500 --> 04:47:04.220
and rethink the entire meeting agenda

04:47:04.220 --> 04:47:06.700
and how we could engage in deep conversations

04:47:06.700 --> 04:47:10.460
around literacy with a relatively large group of people

04:47:10.460 --> 04:47:11.580
in a virtual space.

04:47:11.580 --> 04:47:14.140
So during the last 10 months or so,

04:47:14.140 --> 04:47:18.060
we've all become pretty accustomed as of today

04:47:18.060 --> 04:47:21.500
having relatively large meetings in virtual spaces.

04:47:21.500 --> 04:47:26.500
But back in March 2020, that was a bit of a challenge.

04:47:26.740 --> 04:47:28.820
That was really pushing the envelope.

04:47:28.820 --> 04:47:30.900
I am pleased to say that despite

04:47:30.900 --> 04:47:33.660
all of the challenges presented,

04:47:33.660 --> 04:47:37.140
the meeting was extremely successful.

04:47:38.020 --> 04:47:39.580
As you can see from the document,

04:47:39.580 --> 04:47:41.900
the team engaged in an accelerated version

04:47:41.900 --> 04:47:44.380
of the startup continuous improvement process

04:47:44.380 --> 04:47:45.820
back in March,

04:47:45.820 --> 04:47:49.340
discussing goals, reviewing the CASP data,

04:47:49.340 --> 04:47:52.620
the DRDP data, the needs assessment data,

04:47:52.620 --> 04:47:55.140
and evaluating evidence-based literacy strategies

04:47:55.140 --> 04:47:57.540
to determine which ones might best be applied

04:47:57.540 --> 04:48:00.020
to address the identified areas of need.

04:48:01.020 --> 04:48:04.740
And here's a pandemic silver lining.

04:48:04.740 --> 04:48:07.580
Initially, we'd intended to bring the plan

04:48:07.580 --> 04:48:11.140
to the board for feedback in May 2020

04:48:11.140 --> 04:48:14.260
and for approval in July 2020.

04:48:14.260 --> 04:48:17.580
When that was not possible,

04:48:17.580 --> 04:48:19.300
we negotiated with our colleagues

04:48:19.300 --> 04:48:21.380
at the United States Department of Education

04:48:21.380 --> 04:48:23.580
to revise our grant timeline.

04:48:23.580 --> 04:48:27.940
And we provided an update around that shifted timeline

04:48:28.220 --> 04:48:30.700
to you in an August 2020 memorandum.

04:48:32.020 --> 04:48:34.940
And that gift of extra time provided us

04:48:34.940 --> 04:48:36.500
with opportunities to gather

04:48:36.500 --> 04:48:40.140
and incorporate substantive stakeholder feedback

04:48:40.140 --> 04:48:43.380
and has resulted in a much stronger plan.

04:48:43.380 --> 04:48:46.380
So there's a little silver lining.

04:48:46.380 --> 04:48:50.020
Extended our timeline and we're able

04:48:50.020 --> 04:48:52.300
to build a stronger plan with the extra time.

04:48:54.900 --> 04:48:57.500
We took all of the team's input,

04:48:58.060 --> 04:48:59.580
having had the timeline extended

04:48:59.580 --> 04:49:02.140
and made considerable revisions to the draft.

04:49:02.140 --> 04:49:04.020
We also worked with a small group

04:49:04.020 --> 04:49:06.700
to draft the comprehensive and integrated literacy model

04:49:06.700 --> 04:49:09.620
described at the start of the document.

04:49:09.620 --> 04:49:12.420
And then in August, with our extra time,

04:49:12.420 --> 04:49:16.380
we reconvened that literacy team for another two days

04:49:16.380 --> 04:49:19.660
to gather feedback on the updated draft.

04:49:19.660 --> 04:49:22.100
After the second meeting of the literacy team,

04:49:22.100 --> 04:49:26.020
we made additional revisions based on their inputs

04:49:26.020 --> 04:49:27.380
and then brought the plan

04:49:27.380 --> 04:49:29.540
to the instructional quality commission

04:49:29.540 --> 04:49:30.900
to get its feedback

04:49:30.900 --> 04:49:33.660
and to open up a formal public comment period.

04:49:33.660 --> 04:49:36.420
So again, these are things that we didn't build

04:49:36.420 --> 04:49:40.140
into our first very accelerated timeline in our proposal

04:49:40.140 --> 04:49:43.780
and being able to make this plan available

04:49:43.780 --> 04:49:47.460
to the general public and have a formal public comment period

04:49:47.460 --> 04:49:49.380
helps us to feel more comfortable

04:49:49.380 --> 04:49:53.420
that we really have gotten good feedback from many more

04:49:53.540 --> 04:49:57.340
than the people we had originally intended to share it with.

04:49:58.660 --> 04:50:01.220
In November, 2020, we brought the public comment

04:50:01.220 --> 04:50:03.300
and our recommended revisions to the plan

04:50:03.300 --> 04:50:07.260
based on that comment to the IQC for approval.

04:50:07.260 --> 04:50:09.180
The IQC approved our recommendations

04:50:09.180 --> 04:50:11.460
and we updated the draft accordingly

04:50:11.460 --> 04:50:14.740
and that version of the plan crafted over the course

04:50:14.740 --> 04:50:16.180
of more than a year

04:50:16.180 --> 04:50:18.780
and with input from hundreds of literacy experts

04:50:18.780 --> 04:50:21.220
and other stakeholders from across the state

04:50:21.220 --> 04:50:23.060
is what is before you today.

04:50:24.260 --> 04:50:28.380
So I'd like to spend just a couple of minutes

04:50:28.380 --> 04:50:32.740
just grounding us in the purpose of this document.

04:50:32.740 --> 04:50:35.500
The purpose of the plan is stated in our proposal

04:50:35.500 --> 04:50:38.620
and as we've worked through some of the issues

04:50:38.620 --> 04:50:41.220
that have come up is really to align

04:50:41.220 --> 04:50:45.460
and integrate state literacy initiatives, content standards

04:50:45.460 --> 04:50:49.060
and state guidance documents to support teachers

04:50:49.060 --> 04:50:52.260
of students from birth through grade 12.

04:50:52.260 --> 04:50:55.500
So I should have said,

04:50:55.500 --> 04:50:58.140
this is to align and integrate

04:50:58.140 --> 04:51:01.660
existing state literacy initiatives.

04:51:01.660 --> 04:51:04.500
The plan is not meant to establish new guidance

04:51:04.500 --> 04:51:07.300
on literacy curriculum or instruction

04:51:07.300 --> 04:51:08.460
because as you well know,

04:51:08.460 --> 04:51:11.020
California already has formal, lengthy

04:51:11.020 --> 04:51:13.180
and robust processes in place

04:51:13.180 --> 04:51:15.940
to develop guidance on curriculum instruction.

04:51:15.940 --> 04:51:19.380
And my understanding is that California's ELA ELD framework

04:51:19.380 --> 04:51:24.260
will be updated relatively soon through that formal process.

04:51:25.340 --> 04:51:29.580
The plan also does not contain any tools or templates.

04:51:29.580 --> 04:51:30.740
These will be housed

04:51:30.740 --> 04:51:34.020
in an online literacy resource repository

04:51:34.020 --> 04:51:37.220
as they are identified or developed.

04:51:37.220 --> 04:51:40.780
Okay, so we're creating a local literacy planning tool.

04:51:40.780 --> 04:51:42.820
So this is definitely a state plan.

04:51:42.820 --> 04:51:45.060
It is not an LEA plan.

04:51:45.060 --> 04:51:46.500
We are in the process of creating

04:51:46.500 --> 04:51:48.820
a local literacy planning tool

04:51:48.820 --> 04:51:51.020
that will be aligned to this plan

04:51:51.020 --> 04:51:54.940
so that LEAs can use that voluntarily.

04:51:54.940 --> 04:51:57.100
This tool, once it's completed,

04:51:57.100 --> 04:51:59.340
will be included in the repository.

04:52:01.900 --> 04:52:03.300
The second purpose of the plan

04:52:03.300 --> 04:52:05.140
is to support continuous improvement

04:52:05.140 --> 04:52:08.340
of local literacy programs by bringing coherence

04:52:08.340 --> 04:52:10.340
to the myriad of California documents,

04:52:10.340 --> 04:52:12.260
initiatives and resources

04:52:12.260 --> 04:52:15.700
to support comprehensive and integrated implementation

04:52:15.740 --> 04:52:18.700
of high quality evidence-based literacy instruction.

04:52:19.940 --> 04:52:21.660
The plan relies very heavily

04:52:21.660 --> 04:52:23.620
on California's Common Core Standards

04:52:23.620 --> 04:52:25.740
for English Language Arts and Literacy

04:52:25.740 --> 04:52:30.740
and our groundbreaking 2014 ELA ELD curriculum framework

04:52:30.740 --> 04:52:32.540
but it also organizes a variety

04:52:32.540 --> 04:52:34.940
of other key documents and policies

04:52:34.940 --> 04:52:37.100
such as the English Learn Roadmap

04:52:37.100 --> 04:52:39.620
and the California Dyslexia Guidelines

04:52:39.620 --> 04:52:42.100
into a comprehensive literacy framework.

04:52:42.740 --> 04:52:44.420
And finally, the plan models

04:52:44.420 --> 04:52:46.060
a continuous improvement process

04:52:46.060 --> 04:52:48.540
aligned to the continuous improvement process

04:52:48.540 --> 04:52:51.460
that districts identified for differentiated assistance

04:52:51.460 --> 04:52:54.220
have been using to improve local outcomes.

04:52:54.220 --> 04:52:57.060
Consistent with that continuous improvement model,

04:52:57.060 --> 04:52:59.260
the plan reports and the state team examine

04:52:59.260 --> 04:53:01.540
and made recommendations based upon

04:53:01.540 --> 04:53:04.060
student literacy achievement data.

04:53:06.580 --> 04:53:07.900
So with all of that in mind,

04:53:07.900 --> 04:53:09.780
let's look at how the plan is organized

04:53:09.780 --> 04:53:11.500
and how it's being used.

04:53:11.500 --> 04:53:12.980
The plan is organized.

04:53:14.100 --> 04:53:15.940
The state literacy team recommended

04:53:15.940 --> 04:53:18.380
that we include an executive summary at the beginning

04:53:18.380 --> 04:53:21.460
to provide a high level overview of what's in the plan.

04:53:21.460 --> 04:53:23.820
The introduction includes background information

04:53:23.820 --> 04:53:25.380
on the federal grant program,

04:53:25.380 --> 04:53:27.860
the purpose and logic model,

04:53:27.860 --> 04:53:29.740
a section on how to read the plan

04:53:29.740 --> 04:53:32.860
and what each specific audience might find useful

04:53:32.860 --> 04:53:36.220
and information on California's diverse student population.

04:53:37.340 --> 04:53:39.700
Then we get into the body of the document,

04:53:39.700 --> 04:53:41.980
the comprehensive and integrated literacy model

04:53:41.980 --> 04:53:44.140
helps us to meet our purpose of aligning

04:53:44.140 --> 04:53:47.860
and integrating state literacy resources and initiatives

04:53:47.860 --> 04:53:49.900
in order to demonstrate how they're connected

04:53:49.900 --> 04:53:53.300
and best utilized in a coherent way.

04:53:53.300 --> 04:53:55.580
These resources are identified as defining

04:53:55.580 --> 04:53:58.140
what best first instruction is,

04:53:58.140 --> 04:54:01.260
or they're identified as supporting best first instruction.

04:54:01.260 --> 04:54:03.340
I'm gonna talk about that a little bit more

04:54:03.340 --> 04:54:05.740
in a couple of minutes.

04:54:06.740 --> 04:54:10.660
The continuous improvement process section of the plan

04:54:10.660 --> 04:54:13.780
goes through each step of the continuous improvement process

04:54:13.780 --> 04:54:16.580
that the CDE and its statewide literacy partners

04:54:16.580 --> 04:54:19.340
are using to assess statewide literacy needs

04:54:19.340 --> 04:54:22.260
and develop plans to leverage the grant funds

04:54:22.260 --> 04:54:26.860
to address those needs within three specific age grade bands,

04:54:26.860 --> 04:54:28.660
birth to age five,

04:54:28.660 --> 04:54:31.420
transitional kindergarten to grade five,

04:54:31.420 --> 04:54:33.380
and grade six to 12.

04:54:33.380 --> 04:54:35.060
I'll also provide a little more detail

04:54:35.060 --> 04:54:36.700
about that section in a minute.

04:54:37.820 --> 04:54:41.300
And then finally, the plan includes a work cited section

04:54:41.300 --> 04:54:45.340
and a few appendices, including glossary, data tables,

04:54:45.340 --> 04:54:47.780
and additional CASP results.

04:54:52.500 --> 04:54:54.740
So now to provide a bit more detail,

04:54:54.740 --> 04:54:56.340
I'd like to provide you with an overview

04:54:56.340 --> 04:54:59.580
of the comprehensive and integrated literacy model.

04:55:00.580 --> 04:55:01.740
As you are well aware,

04:55:01.780 --> 04:55:04.700
California has many, many existing policies,

04:55:04.700 --> 04:55:07.020
guidance documents, and structures

04:55:07.020 --> 04:55:10.700
designed to improve literacy for all California students.

04:55:10.700 --> 04:55:12.900
And while several investments and initiatives

04:55:12.900 --> 04:55:15.260
have really focused on the implementation

04:55:15.260 --> 04:55:17.220
of these documents,

04:55:17.220 --> 04:55:19.540
the statewide needs assessment revealed

04:55:19.540 --> 04:55:22.100
that many of our colleagues in the field

04:55:22.100 --> 04:55:24.820
are challenged to understand how these resources

04:55:24.820 --> 04:55:26.860
might complement one another.

04:55:26.860 --> 04:55:28.300
How do they all work together

04:55:28.300 --> 04:55:31.220
to really improve outcomes for kids?

04:55:32.060 --> 04:55:33.820
The state plan gave us an opportunity

04:55:33.820 --> 04:55:35.900
to align and integrate the resources

04:55:35.900 --> 04:55:37.980
in order to demonstrate how they're connected

04:55:37.980 --> 04:55:39.900
and can be used in a coherent way.

04:55:41.060 --> 04:55:42.900
Since the focus of the federal grant

04:55:42.900 --> 04:55:45.420
is improving instruction for students,

04:55:45.420 --> 04:55:47.500
the Center of California's Comprehensive

04:55:47.500 --> 04:55:51.260
and Integrated Literacy Model is best-first instruction,

04:55:51.260 --> 04:55:53.100
which we believe is tier one

04:55:53.100 --> 04:55:56.820
of the Multi-Tiered System of Support, or MTSS.

04:55:56.820 --> 04:55:58.620
This is figure one in the draft plan,

04:55:58.620 --> 04:56:01.220
which you can find on page 18 of the document,

04:56:01.580 --> 04:56:03.820
it might look small where you're looking at it.

04:56:04.900 --> 04:56:06.780
The California MTSS Model

04:56:06.780 --> 04:56:09.260
is an integrated comprehensive framework

04:56:09.260 --> 04:56:13.260
that focuses on content standards, core instruction,

04:56:13.260 --> 04:56:16.700
differentiated learning, student-centered learning,

04:56:16.700 --> 04:56:18.860
individualized student supports,

04:56:18.860 --> 04:56:21.220
and the alignment of systems necessary

04:56:21.220 --> 04:56:22.500
to support all students'

04:56:22.500 --> 04:56:25.580
academic, behavioral, and social success.

04:56:25.580 --> 04:56:29.020
California has invested about $45 million

04:56:29.020 --> 04:56:33.460
into developing and implementing a California MTSS Model.

04:56:33.460 --> 04:56:35.100
And thanks to the work of our colleagues

04:56:35.100 --> 04:56:37.020
at the Orange County Department of Education

04:56:37.020 --> 04:56:39.100
and Butte County Office of Education,

04:56:40.020 --> 04:56:42.380
all 58 of our county offices

04:56:42.380 --> 04:56:44.940
and more than 600 of our school districts

04:56:44.940 --> 04:56:47.860
have received funding and training to implement this model.

04:56:47.860 --> 04:56:50.460
So this approach should be very familiar

04:56:50.460 --> 04:56:52.820
to most Californians.

04:56:52.820 --> 04:56:55.460
So the figure shows the three tiers of MTSS

04:56:55.460 --> 04:56:57.980
really highlighting tier one.

04:56:57.980 --> 04:56:59.940
The goal of tier one is for all students

04:56:59.940 --> 04:57:03.180
to receive high quality standards aligned instruction

04:57:03.180 --> 04:57:06.060
using culturally and linguistically responsive teaching

04:57:06.060 --> 04:57:08.420
that meets the full range of student needs.

04:57:09.340 --> 04:57:11.060
You'll notice that the diagram

04:57:11.060 --> 04:57:13.700
identifies several tier one state resources,

04:57:13.700 --> 04:57:16.780
including all of the board adopted content standards,

04:57:16.780 --> 04:57:19.660
including model school library standards,

04:57:19.660 --> 04:57:21.260
all of the curriculum frameworks

04:57:21.260 --> 04:57:23.540
and the early learning foundations,

04:57:23.540 --> 04:57:27.180
and assessments and instructional resources.

04:57:27.220 --> 04:57:29.620
Also in tier one are several key resources

04:57:29.620 --> 04:57:31.020
developed by the CDE,

04:57:31.020 --> 04:57:33.220
including the new Improving Education

04:57:33.220 --> 04:57:36.740
for Multilingual and English Learner Students publication,

04:57:36.740 --> 04:57:38.740
the Dyslexia Guidelines,

04:57:38.740 --> 04:57:40.340
and the Practitioner's Guide

04:57:40.340 --> 04:57:43.700
for Educating English Learners with Disabilities.

04:57:43.700 --> 04:57:47.860
We're identifying all of these resources as tier one resources,

04:57:47.860 --> 04:57:50.060
which means that all educators should be familiar

04:57:50.060 --> 04:57:52.500
with the guidance found in these resources

04:57:52.500 --> 04:57:56.780
because it applies to all students in all classrooms.

04:57:56.780 --> 04:58:00.020
The plan then goes on to provide brief descriptions

04:58:00.020 --> 04:58:01.740
of these state resources

04:58:01.740 --> 04:58:04.940
and how they can be leveraged to meet literacy objectives.

04:58:07.660 --> 04:58:10.660
Figure two builds upon figure one

04:58:10.660 --> 04:58:12.740
and presents the entire comprehensive

04:58:12.740 --> 04:58:14.820
and integrated literacy model.

04:58:14.820 --> 04:58:18.620
You can find this model on page 34 of the draft document.

04:58:19.940 --> 04:58:21.820
The model illustrates a system

04:58:21.820 --> 04:58:23.860
or high quality literacy instruction

04:58:23.860 --> 04:58:26.740
occurs within the context of inclusive

04:58:26.740 --> 04:58:28.900
and equitable systems of schooling,

04:58:28.900 --> 04:58:31.180
featuring high levels of engagement,

04:58:31.180 --> 04:58:33.420
a focus on continuous improvement,

04:58:33.420 --> 04:58:37.220
and application of the California MTSS framework.

04:58:37.220 --> 04:58:38.580
The goal of the federal grant

04:58:38.580 --> 04:58:40.300
is to improve literacy instruction.

04:58:40.300 --> 04:58:43.580
So at the center of this model is figure one,

04:58:43.580 --> 04:58:46.860
the MTSS and Best First Instruction Triangle.

04:58:46.860 --> 04:58:51.420
And around this center are four important elements

04:58:51.420 --> 04:58:54.700
necessary for supporting Best First Instruction.

04:58:54.700 --> 04:58:56.860
So those are the quadrants,

04:58:56.860 --> 04:59:01.180
celebration of diversity and an asset-based approach,

04:59:01.180 --> 04:59:04.020
very important for California

04:59:04.020 --> 04:59:07.980
and frankly, just very important for students,

04:59:07.980 --> 04:59:09.700
teachers, and human beings.

04:59:10.780 --> 04:59:15.020
Whole child, another very important orientation.

04:59:15.020 --> 04:59:16.340
If we want learning to happen,

04:59:16.340 --> 04:59:19.820
we need to take care of SEL, health, safety, nutrition.

04:59:20.780 --> 04:59:24.260
Well-prepared and supported teachers and leaders.

04:59:24.260 --> 04:59:26.980
You can see that in the third quadrant,

04:59:26.980 --> 04:59:29.140
and then family and community engagement.

04:59:29.140 --> 04:59:30.980
And I think the last 10 months

04:59:30.980 --> 04:59:33.580
as we've moved through the pandemic response

04:59:33.580 --> 04:59:36.300
have really highlighted the importance

04:59:36.300 --> 04:59:38.180
of those four elements.

04:59:38.180 --> 04:59:41.100
We have mapped key state level resources

04:59:41.100 --> 04:59:43.420
to each of these elements

04:59:43.420 --> 04:59:46.460
to help people understand how that fits together

04:59:46.460 --> 04:59:50.580
and have also included the LCFF state priorities

04:59:50.580 --> 04:59:53.700
throughout the elements to illustrate how these resources

04:59:53.700 --> 04:59:56.500
can be leveraged by LEAs to meet the priorities

04:59:56.500 --> 04:59:59.740
by the Local Control and Accountability Plan.

04:59:59.740 --> 05:00:03.420
So I won't go into detail for the sake of time,

05:00:03.420 --> 05:00:06.740
but we worked with a smallish group of folks

05:00:06.740 --> 05:00:10.140
with deep expertise in each one of these elements

05:00:10.140 --> 05:00:12.580
and MTSS to really think through

05:00:12.580 --> 05:00:14.620
how might this all fit together?

05:00:16.860 --> 05:00:19.380
Some of these resources span several quadrants.

05:00:19.380 --> 05:00:21.380
So within the text of this section,

05:00:21.380 --> 05:00:23.540
those connections are made.

05:00:23.540 --> 05:00:25.820
It's very hard to sort things into buckets.

05:00:25.820 --> 05:00:27.420
You know, there are always overlaps,

05:00:27.420 --> 05:00:30.660
but we do try and highlight some of those connections

05:00:30.660 --> 05:00:34.660
across the model in the narrative that follows,

05:00:34.660 --> 05:00:37.780
further showing alignment and coherence.

05:00:37.780 --> 05:00:39.540
The model presented in the plan

05:00:39.540 --> 05:00:42.700
sets the direction for literacy programs statewide

05:00:42.700 --> 05:00:46.220
by aligning and integrating state literacy initiatives.

05:00:46.260 --> 05:00:49.180
It also sets the direction for the activities

05:00:49.180 --> 05:00:51.740
outlined in the next section of the plan.

05:00:51.740 --> 05:00:53.300
And at the local level,

05:00:53.300 --> 05:00:56.020
we hope that the comprehensive and integrated literacy model

05:00:56.020 --> 05:00:59.180
can support LEAs to consider the degree

05:00:59.180 --> 05:01:01.780
to which literacy programs are leveraging

05:01:01.780 --> 05:01:05.380
existing state guidance and resources

05:01:05.380 --> 05:01:08.140
to help meet the specific needs of students.

05:01:10.780 --> 05:01:14.340
So that's the first big part of the plan.

05:01:14.340 --> 05:01:18.740
The next section of the plan details each step

05:01:18.740 --> 05:01:20.980
of a continuous improvement process

05:01:20.980 --> 05:01:22.900
that we use at the state level

05:01:22.900 --> 05:01:27.060
in order to demonstrate how the CDE and its partners

05:01:27.060 --> 05:01:30.300
assess literacy needs statewide and then develop plans

05:01:30.300 --> 05:01:33.420
to leverage the grant funds to address those needs.

05:01:36.140 --> 05:01:38.260
In this way, the plan models the process

05:01:38.260 --> 05:01:39.500
that can serve as an example

05:01:39.500 --> 05:01:42.180
for developing local literacy plan.

05:01:42.180 --> 05:01:44.220
This section of the plan provides call-outs

05:01:44.220 --> 05:01:47.580
in blue dotted line boxes with examples

05:01:47.580 --> 05:01:51.180
for how LEAs can use the process to support literacy.

05:01:51.180 --> 05:01:54.180
But I want to reiterate that the state plan before you

05:01:54.180 --> 05:01:56.820
aims to serve as a model for how LEAs

05:01:56.820 --> 05:01:59.420
might use a continuous improvement process.

05:02:00.460 --> 05:02:03.380
Supporting districts to develop local literacy plans

05:02:03.380 --> 05:02:08.380
is an objective deliverable of our federal grant,

05:02:08.860 --> 05:02:11.020
but we do not intend for districts

05:02:11.020 --> 05:02:13.580
to adapt this particular document

05:02:13.620 --> 05:02:16.300
to create their own local literacy plans.

05:02:16.300 --> 05:02:21.300
We are building out a tool that will have more detail

05:02:21.300 --> 05:02:22.700
and more things that are relevant

05:02:22.700 --> 05:02:26.820
to a district school level that LEAs will be able to use

05:02:26.820 --> 05:02:30.100
to develop their own local literacy plans.

05:02:30.100 --> 05:02:33.740
So step one is just setting direction and purpose.

05:02:35.060 --> 05:02:37.340
We make it clear that the comprehensive

05:02:37.340 --> 05:02:39.580
integrated literacy model sets the direction

05:02:39.580 --> 05:02:42.060
for literacy programs statewide.

05:02:42.060 --> 05:02:44.300
And you'll see excerpts from the early learning

05:02:44.300 --> 05:02:47.540
and ELA ELD frameworks that highlight the literacy learning

05:02:47.540 --> 05:02:51.780
that takes place in each of the age or grade bands.

05:02:51.780 --> 05:02:54.180
Most importantly, this step establishes

05:02:54.180 --> 05:02:56.700
that the goal of the plan is for our students

05:02:56.700 --> 05:02:58.900
to meet grade level expectations set forth

05:02:58.900 --> 05:03:02.380
in the common core state standards for ELA literacy,

05:03:02.380 --> 05:03:04.940
and that the guidance in California's framework

05:03:04.940 --> 05:03:06.340
be implemented well.

05:03:08.580 --> 05:03:11.100
Step two is where we looked at the current outcomes

05:03:11.100 --> 05:03:15.180
that the system is producing and try to determine causes.

05:03:15.180 --> 05:03:17.620
Here you'll see current statewide literacy data

05:03:17.620 --> 05:03:21.140
from the 2019 desired results developmental profile

05:03:21.140 --> 05:03:23.820
for four-year-olds and the 2019 results

05:03:23.820 --> 05:03:26.260
from the CASP ELA literacy assessment.

05:03:27.580 --> 05:03:30.340
We also clarify how these results in other assessments

05:03:30.340 --> 05:03:32.380
use different assessment cycles,

05:03:32.380 --> 05:03:35.100
and that this is not all of the data that was

05:03:35.100 --> 05:03:38.140
or should be considered in the process.

05:03:38.140 --> 05:03:40.180
We need to look at complete dashboard data,

05:03:40.180 --> 05:03:42.900
which includes English language proficiency growth

05:03:42.900 --> 05:03:46.580
and student engagement and school climate measures.

05:03:46.580 --> 05:03:48.180
The step also provides a review

05:03:48.180 --> 05:03:51.260
of the comprehensive statewide literacy needs assessment

05:03:51.260 --> 05:03:53.700
and describes the work of the state literacy team.

05:03:56.420 --> 05:03:58.220
Step three captures much of the work

05:03:58.220 --> 05:04:00.980
that we've been engaged in with the state literacy team,

05:04:00.980 --> 05:04:02.860
who really worked hard to help us select

05:04:02.860 --> 05:04:06.900
and prioritize strategies to address statewide literacy needs.

05:04:06.900 --> 05:04:08.140
In this section of the plan,

05:04:08.180 --> 05:04:10.420
one of these priorities are outlined for each age

05:04:10.420 --> 05:04:13.380
or grade band with key state guidance

05:04:13.380 --> 05:04:17.060
and resources highlighted to inform state level activities

05:04:17.060 --> 05:04:18.780
that will be supported with grant funds

05:04:18.780 --> 05:04:21.100
within the context of comprehensive

05:04:21.100 --> 05:04:23.620
and integrated literacy instruction.

05:04:23.620 --> 05:04:27.020
And I want to reiterate that the intent

05:04:27.020 --> 05:04:30.820
is that we support comprehensive literacy instruction

05:04:32.980 --> 05:04:35.860
that our subgrantees will work with districts and schools

05:04:35.860 --> 05:04:39.460
to support comprehensive literacy instruction,

05:04:39.460 --> 05:04:42.460
but we'll focus on one of these priorities,

05:04:42.460 --> 05:04:47.460
though deeper in the priorities that are coming up.

05:04:48.660 --> 05:04:51.980
The next few slides will summarize those.

05:04:51.980 --> 05:04:55.540
So for birth through age five,

05:04:55.540 --> 05:04:59.980
we landed on these two statewide literacy priorities

05:04:59.980 --> 05:05:03.620
and 15% of the grant funds will fund

05:05:03.620 --> 05:05:05.940
one county office of education

05:05:05.940 --> 05:05:08.620
to support implementation of these priorities

05:05:08.620 --> 05:05:12.820
within the context of comprehensive literacy instruction,

05:05:12.820 --> 05:05:15.500
support early childhood education programs

05:05:15.500 --> 05:05:18.780
to create literacy rich environments and experiences

05:05:20.180 --> 05:05:23.020
and support the quality of early education programs

05:05:23.020 --> 05:05:25.500
and their capacity to support early language

05:05:25.500 --> 05:05:27.380
and literacy skills.

05:05:27.380 --> 05:05:30.580
And they will also increase parenting support

05:05:30.580 --> 05:05:33.900
by increasing parental knowledge, skills and confidence

05:05:33.900 --> 05:05:36.900
through parenting curriculum and literacy activities

05:05:36.900 --> 05:05:39.980
with special attention to access and equity for all.

05:05:42.220 --> 05:05:46.340
For TK, transitional kindergarten through grade five,

05:05:47.220 --> 05:05:49.500
the priorities that were identified,

05:05:49.500 --> 05:05:52.900
build teacher capacity for tier one foundational skills

05:05:52.900 --> 05:05:54.300
and reading comprehension,

05:05:54.300 --> 05:05:57.940
including best first reading and writing instruction,

05:05:57.940 --> 05:06:00.740
build school capacity for effective literacy

05:06:00.740 --> 05:06:03.220
and English language instruction for ELs,

05:06:04.700 --> 05:06:07.820
English learners, sorry, I don't like to say ELs,

05:06:07.820 --> 05:06:10.580
including opportunities to develop by literacy

05:06:10.580 --> 05:06:13.940
and primary language instruction wherever possible,

05:06:13.940 --> 05:06:16.500
build school capacity to support students

05:06:16.500 --> 05:06:18.980
struggling with reading, including but not limited

05:06:18.980 --> 05:06:22.260
to students with disabilities and students with dyslexia

05:06:23.420 --> 05:06:25.420
and increase sustainable high quality

05:06:25.420 --> 05:06:26.980
professional learning systems,

05:06:26.980 --> 05:06:29.460
including literacy coaching models.

05:06:32.420 --> 05:06:36.580
And for students in grade six through grade 12,

05:06:36.580 --> 05:06:39.500
the priorities established by the state literacy team

05:06:39.500 --> 05:06:42.940
and in collaboration with the state literacy team

05:06:42.940 --> 05:06:45.700
and CDE and various other folks,

05:06:45.700 --> 05:06:48.300
build teacher capacity across disciplines

05:06:48.300 --> 05:06:49.860
for literacy instruction,

05:06:50.900 --> 05:06:53.940
increase asset-based teaching in schools,

05:06:53.940 --> 05:06:56.500
including culturally and linguistically responsive

05:06:56.500 --> 05:06:58.740
and sustaining pedagogies,

05:06:58.740 --> 05:07:01.420
build school capacity for effective content,

05:07:01.420 --> 05:07:03.660
academic content and literacy instruction

05:07:03.660 --> 05:07:05.060
for English learners,

05:07:05.060 --> 05:07:07.900
including opportunities to develop by literacy

05:07:07.900 --> 05:07:11.220
and primary language instruction wherever possible

05:07:11.220 --> 05:07:15.500
and build school capacity for effective literacy instruction

05:07:15.500 --> 05:07:17.340
for students with disabilities.

05:07:18.740 --> 05:07:21.900
Step three of the plan also lists and describes

05:07:21.900 --> 05:07:23.260
the state level activities

05:07:23.260 --> 05:07:25.740
to be funded through the grant program.

05:07:25.780 --> 05:07:29.340
Subgrants to the local literacy lead agencies

05:07:29.340 --> 05:07:31.820
will support the implementation and study

05:07:31.820 --> 05:07:33.900
of evidence-based strategies

05:07:33.900 --> 05:07:36.260
to address statewide literacy priorities

05:07:36.260 --> 05:07:37.580
and support the literacy needs

05:07:37.580 --> 05:07:40.700
of economically disadvantaged and high-need students.

05:07:41.620 --> 05:07:43.780
We're proposing to award subgrants

05:07:43.780 --> 05:07:46.100
to seven county offices of education

05:07:46.100 --> 05:07:48.300
or consortia of county offices

05:07:48.300 --> 05:07:50.980
to implement three-year small-scale pilots

05:07:50.980 --> 05:07:52.940
with one or more local districts.

05:07:53.940 --> 05:07:57.260
Consistent with federal requirements,

05:07:57.260 --> 05:08:00.220
the birth to age five lead

05:08:00.220 --> 05:08:03.420
will receive 15% of the funding.

05:08:03.420 --> 05:08:05.260
The kindergarten to grade five

05:08:05.260 --> 05:08:08.780
and transitional kindergarten to grade five leads,

05:08:08.780 --> 05:08:09.820
there'll be three of them,

05:08:09.820 --> 05:08:12.380
will receive 40% of the funding.

05:08:12.380 --> 05:08:14.580
The grade six to grade 12 leads

05:08:14.580 --> 05:08:16.780
will receive 40% of the funding,

05:08:16.780 --> 05:08:19.300
and those percentages are just defined

05:08:19.300 --> 05:08:21.620
in the grant program.

05:08:21.780 --> 05:08:22.860
That's pretty exciting,

05:08:22.860 --> 05:08:25.260
just to think about being able to fund

05:08:25.260 --> 05:08:27.060
that zero to five grade band.

05:08:27.060 --> 05:08:30.260
Typically, the opportunities that I've seen from ED,

05:08:30.260 --> 05:08:32.380
I know our early learning and care folks

05:08:33.540 --> 05:08:35.220
have all kinds of different opportunities,

05:08:35.220 --> 05:08:38.260
but this is the first time, I think,

05:08:38.260 --> 05:08:40.860
our division has been asked to look at

05:08:40.860 --> 05:08:45.860
that really critical phase of literacy development.

05:08:47.100 --> 05:08:49.500
So we anticipate that the request for application

05:08:49.500 --> 05:08:53.660
for these subgrants will be released in spring of 2021,

05:08:54.660 --> 05:08:58.380
shortly after the state literacy plan is approved.

05:08:58.380 --> 05:09:01.540
I have staff starting to draft that already.

05:09:04.700 --> 05:09:06.460
Additional state-level activities

05:09:06.460 --> 05:09:08.180
include developing and providing

05:09:08.180 --> 05:09:10.740
professional learning opportunities and resources

05:09:10.740 --> 05:09:13.060
to support LEAs as they build capacity

05:09:13.060 --> 05:09:15.700
and develop their local literacy plans.

05:09:15.700 --> 05:09:18.140
Right now, the CDE is building

05:09:18.140 --> 05:09:20.700
a literacy knowledge building series

05:09:20.700 --> 05:09:23.740
in collaboration with members of the state literacy team

05:09:23.740 --> 05:09:25.900
and other partners.

05:09:25.900 --> 05:09:28.540
Yeah, I don't think anyone should go to the link

05:09:28.540 --> 05:09:29.780
in this PowerPoint.

05:09:29.780 --> 05:09:32.060
I don't think that's published yet.

05:09:32.060 --> 05:09:36.580
I'm gonna bring it to share with you in March, though.

05:09:36.580 --> 05:09:38.820
This series is a set of videos

05:09:38.820 --> 05:09:41.260
with guidance on a variety of topics,

05:09:41.260 --> 05:09:43.860
including, but not limited to,

05:09:43.860 --> 05:09:46.820
these are the ones that are being built out right now,

05:09:46.820 --> 05:09:50.420
but we will be working on this grant through 2024.

05:09:52.660 --> 05:09:55.180
So I anticipate that this series

05:09:55.180 --> 05:09:59.020
will be pretty impressive within the next year.

05:09:59.020 --> 05:10:01.060
Right now, I find it impressive.

05:10:01.060 --> 05:10:02.460
The topics that we're working on

05:10:02.460 --> 05:10:04.900
are supporting students with dyslexia

05:10:04.900 --> 05:10:07.020
and students who struggle to read,

05:10:08.020 --> 05:10:11.380
intervention and coaching, very important,

05:10:11.380 --> 05:10:15.700
particularly as we think about learning loss mitigation,

05:10:15.700 --> 05:10:19.620
media literacy, literacy across the disciplines,

05:10:19.620 --> 05:10:23.020
foundational skills and core literacy instruction,

05:10:23.020 --> 05:10:25.580
culturally sustaining pedagogy,

05:10:25.580 --> 05:10:28.340
using assessment to inform instruction,

05:10:28.340 --> 05:10:31.300
early education strategies,

05:10:31.300 --> 05:10:34.260
and family engagement strategies.

05:10:34.260 --> 05:10:38.380
So remember before when I said

05:10:39.900 --> 05:10:43.260
the state literacy team was exceptionally generous.

05:10:43.260 --> 05:10:45.620
So the folks who are working with us

05:10:46.540 --> 05:10:49.300
to build out this knowledge building series

05:10:52.020 --> 05:10:54.100
is the state literacy team for the most part.

05:10:54.100 --> 05:10:56.100
We've got some other partners as well.

05:10:56.100 --> 05:10:58.580
So not only did they volunteer to assist us

05:10:58.580 --> 05:10:59.900
with the development of the plan,

05:10:59.900 --> 05:11:01.260
recall they thought they were gonna do

05:11:01.260 --> 05:11:03.620
a two day meeting with us.

05:11:03.620 --> 05:11:06.780
They've given us four full days of their time

05:11:06.780 --> 05:11:09.140
and are continuing to volunteer

05:11:09.140 --> 05:11:12.180
to help us build out this first set of resources.

05:11:12.180 --> 05:11:15.620
So thank you so much, state literacy team.

05:11:15.620 --> 05:11:17.380
You are amazing.

05:11:17.380 --> 05:11:20.220
So in this knowledge building series,

05:11:20.220 --> 05:11:23.100
we'll go a little deeper with the content in the plan

05:11:23.100 --> 05:11:25.260
and make the content more practical

05:11:25.260 --> 05:11:27.540
for teachers and leaders who are working

05:11:27.540 --> 05:11:29.020
to improve literacy outcomes.

05:11:29.020 --> 05:11:31.260
Again, the plan is kind of up at this level.

05:11:31.260 --> 05:11:33.420
How do we enter great policy?

05:11:33.420 --> 05:11:35.180
But we know the intent

05:11:35.180 --> 05:11:38.180
is to really improve instruction in classrooms.

05:11:38.180 --> 05:11:41.620
So these resources are being built

05:11:41.620 --> 05:11:44.700
to help educators who are working very hard

05:11:44.700 --> 05:11:48.340
to improve literacy outcomes, additional supports.

05:11:48.340 --> 05:11:50.460
People will be able to access the information

05:11:50.460 --> 05:11:52.420
when it is convenient for them

05:11:52.420 --> 05:11:54.420
and can view these videos on their own,

05:11:54.420 --> 05:11:56.500
but our intent is that the videos will be used

05:11:56.500 --> 05:11:58.860
to support the work of professional learning communities

05:11:58.860 --> 05:12:00.540
across the state as we all work

05:12:00.540 --> 05:12:02.580
to improve student literacy achievement.

05:12:03.740 --> 05:12:08.020
We are also building an online literacy resources repository

05:12:08.020 --> 05:12:12.020
to house these resources, other existing literacy resources

05:12:12.020 --> 05:12:15.140
and additional resources that will be developed

05:12:15.140 --> 05:12:16.500
during the life of the grant.

05:12:16.500 --> 05:12:20.380
And yes, that group of folks that I have just thanked,

05:12:20.380 --> 05:12:21.540
the state literacy team,

05:12:21.540 --> 05:12:24.340
they are currently working with CDE staff

05:12:24.340 --> 05:12:29.260
to vet existing resources for inclusion in that repository.

05:12:29.260 --> 05:12:33.540
So yes, they are amazing and great stuff is coming.

05:12:33.540 --> 05:12:36.020
These projects are really starting to come together

05:12:36.020 --> 05:12:38.380
and my hope is that I'll be able to give you

05:12:38.380 --> 05:12:42.020
a bit of a tour on some of these new resources

05:12:42.020 --> 05:12:46.220
when I next see you in March at your next meeting.

05:12:47.380 --> 05:12:49.620
So back to the sections of the plan.

05:12:50.580 --> 05:12:54.220
Step four is about how the CDE and its partners

05:12:54.220 --> 05:12:55.900
will monitor and report on the work

05:12:55.900 --> 05:12:57.260
over the course of the grant

05:12:57.260 --> 05:13:00.340
with special attention to a variety of metrics.

05:13:02.900 --> 05:13:05.180
The United States Department of Education

05:13:05.180 --> 05:13:09.060
requires us to report on these metrics quarterly.

05:13:09.060 --> 05:13:10.940
So we are keeping close track of them,

05:13:10.940 --> 05:13:13.700
which is great to be able to have like

05:13:13.700 --> 05:13:16.300
that systematic step four of implementing

05:13:16.300 --> 05:13:18.380
and monitoring work and how it's going.

05:13:20.260 --> 05:13:25.260
And step five, any good continuous improvement model.

05:13:25.940 --> 05:13:28.820
We will revisit the plan over the course of the grant,

05:13:28.820 --> 05:13:32.780
reflect on implementation and progress of the strategies,

05:13:32.780 --> 05:13:36.020
determine any necessary course corrections

05:13:36.020 --> 05:13:41.020
and consider sustaining and expanding successful models.

05:13:41.380 --> 05:13:44.500
My deep down hope is that additional funding

05:13:44.500 --> 05:13:48.500
for this program continues to become available

05:13:48.500 --> 05:13:52.180
and as we learn from the first set of sub-grantees,

05:13:52.180 --> 05:13:55.140
we will be able to fund additional sub-grantees

05:13:55.140 --> 05:13:57.740
and expand our literacy efforts.

05:13:57.740 --> 05:14:01.420
The CLSD grant program is an extension,

05:14:01.420 --> 05:14:04.740
is the next iteration of the striving readers grant program,

05:14:04.740 --> 05:14:06.220
which was going on for a while.

05:14:06.220 --> 05:14:09.900
So the United States Department of Education

05:14:09.900 --> 05:14:14.220
also prioritizes literacy instruction for our kids.

05:14:14.220 --> 05:14:17.060
So I'm hopeful that this is just the start

05:14:17.060 --> 05:14:20.740
of California's grant work.

05:14:23.900 --> 05:14:25.980
So as you've heard throughout this presentation,

05:14:25.980 --> 05:14:28.300
we have made an ongoing effort to ensure

05:14:28.300 --> 05:14:31.100
that we have an abundance of stakeholder engagement

05:14:31.100 --> 05:14:32.940
as we've developed the plan.

05:14:32.940 --> 05:14:35.580
It's also very important to us to provide an opportunity

05:14:35.580 --> 05:14:38.660
for the general public and advocacy organizations

05:14:38.660 --> 05:14:40.420
to provide input on the plan.

05:14:40.420 --> 05:14:44.540
So we were very thankful to be able to bring the document

05:14:44.540 --> 05:14:47.860
to the IQC for that public comment period.

05:14:49.060 --> 05:14:51.900
The public comment period also coincided

05:14:51.900 --> 05:14:53.980
with several stakeholder group meetings,

05:14:53.980 --> 05:14:58.060
which provided us an opportunity to seek additional feedback.

05:14:58.060 --> 05:15:00.540
In the last few months of 2020,

05:15:00.540 --> 05:15:01.700
we shared the draft plan

05:15:01.700 --> 05:15:04.220
with the bilingual coordinators network,

05:15:04.220 --> 05:15:06.860
the state and federal program directors,

05:15:06.860 --> 05:15:10.180
and the advisory commission on special education

05:15:10.180 --> 05:15:12.740
and encouraged them to both provide feedback

05:15:12.740 --> 05:15:14.380
and to help us get the word out

05:15:14.380 --> 05:15:17.980
so folks could participate in the public comment period.

05:15:20.220 --> 05:15:23.460
We created a survey that allowed respondents

05:15:23.460 --> 05:15:27.460
to submit comments via survey or email.

05:15:27.460 --> 05:15:29.420
And for each one of those comments,

05:15:29.420 --> 05:15:31.820
we asked for general information around

05:15:31.820 --> 05:15:36.300
who was responding, comments on each of the sections

05:15:36.300 --> 05:15:38.860
and asked for an overall evaluation of the plan.

05:15:43.300 --> 05:15:46.500
In addition to overall edits,

05:15:46.500 --> 05:15:49.380
the introduction comprehensive and integrated literacy model

05:15:49.380 --> 05:15:50.780
and steps one to five

05:15:50.780 --> 05:15:54.420
of the continuous improvement process sections of the plan

05:15:54.420 --> 05:15:58.740
were revised based on all of that public comment.

05:16:00.420 --> 05:16:05.420
Overall, we received a total of 347 unique comments

05:16:07.820 --> 05:16:10.660
and we had a really good variety of respondents

05:16:10.660 --> 05:16:13.620
from parents and guardians to teacher librarians

05:16:13.620 --> 05:16:15.620
to administrators, community members

05:16:15.620 --> 05:16:18.220
and teachers in the classroom.

05:16:18.220 --> 05:16:22.060
In addition, we had many organizations representing hundreds

05:16:22.060 --> 05:16:24.220
if not thousands of stakeholders

05:16:24.220 --> 05:16:26.700
provide feedback on the draft plan.

05:16:27.700 --> 05:16:30.340
Based on the comments received,

05:16:30.340 --> 05:16:32.620
we highlighted several revisions to the plan

05:16:32.620 --> 05:16:35.940
and presented them to the IQC at their November meeting

05:16:35.940 --> 05:16:37.740
and upon their recommendation,

05:16:37.740 --> 05:16:41.220
we incorporated these edits into the draft plan.

05:16:41.220 --> 05:16:44.020
For example, pretty big oversight

05:16:44.020 --> 05:16:45.700
is that we did not include

05:16:45.700 --> 05:16:48.060
the California Model School Library standards

05:16:48.060 --> 05:16:51.620
in the draft we first presented to the IQC,

05:16:51.620 --> 05:16:54.500
which that was not good.

05:16:54.500 --> 05:16:57.660
So fortunately, we had a lot of teacher librarians

05:16:57.660 --> 05:16:58.500
who chimed in and said,

05:16:58.500 --> 05:16:59.700
hey, how are you gonna have reading

05:16:59.700 --> 05:17:02.660
without librarians and library standards?

05:17:02.660 --> 05:17:05.660
And I'm like, oh yes, thank you, sorry.

05:17:05.660 --> 05:17:07.140
So that was a big one,

05:17:07.140 --> 05:17:10.060
incorporating the California Model School Library standards

05:17:10.060 --> 05:17:11.980
and guidance regarding school libraries

05:17:11.980 --> 05:17:14.740
and teacher librarians from the framework,

05:17:14.740 --> 05:17:17.660
the ELAELD framework throughout the plan

05:17:17.660 --> 05:17:21.340
because we really do know that the development

05:17:21.340 --> 05:17:23.380
of a student's information literacy

05:17:23.380 --> 05:17:26.540
and love for reading and achievement

05:17:26.540 --> 05:17:29.300
in all content standards,

05:17:29.300 --> 05:17:31.900
libraries and librarians are super important.

05:17:31.900 --> 05:17:35.900
So again, apologies to the librarians for that oversight.

05:17:37.620 --> 05:17:39.900
We also cited additional existing guidance

05:17:39.900 --> 05:17:42.700
regarding biliteracy and primary language development,

05:17:42.700 --> 05:17:45.180
including stronger language in the introduction

05:17:45.180 --> 05:17:47.340
to make it clear that the plan aligns

05:17:47.340 --> 05:17:50.740
with California's vision for language acquisition

05:17:50.740 --> 05:17:52.740
that's promoted in the state's education

05:17:52.740 --> 05:17:54.940
for a global economy initiative,

05:17:54.940 --> 05:17:56.980
the California EL roadmap,

05:17:56.980 --> 05:17:58.580
and the state seal of biliteracy.

05:17:58.580 --> 05:18:01.980
So we really strengthen that language to make it clear

05:18:01.980 --> 05:18:06.060
that that's the key focus of our work here in California.

05:18:07.380 --> 05:18:08.900
And the original comprehensive

05:18:08.900 --> 05:18:12.340
and integrated literacy model presented in the plan

05:18:12.340 --> 05:18:13.660
lists the California,

05:18:13.660 --> 05:18:16.260
listed the California Dyslexia Guidelines

05:18:16.260 --> 05:18:18.140
and the California Practitioner's Guide

05:18:18.140 --> 05:18:20.980
for Educating ELs with Disabilities.

05:18:20.980 --> 05:18:22.940
As additional resources,

05:18:22.940 --> 05:18:25.460
but based on the feedback we received,

05:18:25.460 --> 05:18:30.460
we moved reference to them being additional resources

05:18:32.420 --> 05:18:35.100
to communicate their equal importance

05:18:35.100 --> 05:18:37.980
with the other listed tier one resources.

05:18:39.660 --> 05:18:41.860
To make the document a little more user-friendly

05:18:41.860 --> 05:18:43.060
and to provide clarity,

05:18:43.060 --> 05:18:45.580
we included a glossary in the version.

05:18:46.260 --> 05:18:48.300
The first draft that has a glossary

05:18:48.300 --> 05:18:50.340
of frequently used terms and abbreviations,

05:18:50.340 --> 05:18:52.580
which I think is just handy.

05:18:52.580 --> 05:18:54.580
We included the Common Core in Espanol

05:18:54.580 --> 05:18:56.700
and the Spanish language development standards

05:18:56.700 --> 05:19:00.780
in this version to essential biliteracy program resources.

05:19:00.780 --> 05:19:03.060
We also addressed the importance of collaboration

05:19:03.060 --> 05:19:05.500
between early childhood education programs

05:19:05.500 --> 05:19:08.740
and K-12 programs to provide a continuum

05:19:08.740 --> 05:19:10.220
of literacy development.

05:19:11.300 --> 05:19:13.740
And we included a broad definition of literacy

05:19:13.740 --> 05:19:16.140
to address the abundance of information,

05:19:16.140 --> 05:19:20.580
media and technology that's embedded into our daily lives.

05:19:20.580 --> 05:19:24.220
Finally, we made more connections throughout the plan

05:19:24.220 --> 05:19:26.700
among the content areas and literacy,

05:19:26.700 --> 05:19:29.500
including references to the ELA, ELD frameworks,

05:19:29.500 --> 05:19:31.060
snapshots and vignettes,

05:19:31.060 --> 05:19:33.940
which illustrate how ELA, ELD

05:19:33.940 --> 05:19:36.700
and content area instruction can be aligned.

05:19:38.260 --> 05:19:42.100
So I just need to extend a huge thank you

05:19:42.100 --> 05:19:46.100
to all of the individuals and organizations

05:19:46.100 --> 05:19:47.620
who took some time.

05:19:47.620 --> 05:19:49.220
It's been a busy year.

05:19:49.220 --> 05:19:53.100
Anyone who made time during the last year

05:19:53.100 --> 05:19:56.460
to provide feedback on this draft document,

05:19:56.460 --> 05:19:58.580
a deep heartfelt thanks,

05:19:58.580 --> 05:20:02.740
because it really has made this document stronger.

05:20:02.740 --> 05:20:04.380
We appreciate your feedback.

05:20:06.700 --> 05:20:08.700
So this is our current timeline

05:20:08.700 --> 05:20:10.740
based on our year two,

05:20:10.740 --> 05:20:13.500
we're in year two of our federal grant period.

05:20:14.820 --> 05:20:17.580
Our intent is to hear feedback from you there.

05:20:17.580 --> 05:20:20.460
There's January, 2021 right in the middle.

05:20:20.460 --> 05:20:22.380
Our intent is to hear feedback from you

05:20:22.380 --> 05:20:24.900
and public commenters today,

05:20:24.900 --> 05:20:28.620
and then revise the draft plan to incorporate that feedback

05:20:28.620 --> 05:20:32.620
and then bring the plan back to you for approval in March.

05:20:32.620 --> 05:20:33.900
Shortly after that,

05:20:33.900 --> 05:20:38.180
we hope to release the RFA for local literacy leads

05:20:38.180 --> 05:20:41.740
and anticipate that the subgrants will be awarded

05:20:41.740 --> 05:20:45.260
no later than September, 2021.

05:20:45.260 --> 05:20:48.740
I would love to get the funding out sooner.

05:20:48.740 --> 05:20:49.780
As you can imagine,

05:20:49.780 --> 05:20:54.780
we were very excited to be awarded the grant back in 2019,

05:20:55.260 --> 05:20:56.740
and we're even more excited

05:20:56.740 --> 05:20:58.940
to be able to provide resources to LEAs

05:20:58.940 --> 05:21:01.220
to support literacy instruction,

05:21:01.220 --> 05:21:04.140
especially now as the state considers

05:21:04.140 --> 05:21:05.900
learning loss mitigation strategies.

05:21:05.900 --> 05:21:10.540
So again, as soon as we have the plan approved,

05:21:10.540 --> 05:21:14.020
we want to get the funds out for the RFA,

05:21:14.020 --> 05:21:18.540
make the RFA available as shortly after that as we can.

05:21:20.500 --> 05:21:23.020
So here's some important links

05:21:23.020 --> 05:21:24.380
for folks who wanna know more

05:21:24.380 --> 05:21:26.700
about what's going on with this grant program.

05:21:26.700 --> 05:21:27.580
There is a link

05:21:27.580 --> 05:21:30.740
to the Comprehensive State Literacy Development webpage

05:21:30.740 --> 05:21:35.740
and instructions for joining our listserv and an email.

05:21:36.900 --> 05:21:41.700
clsdp at cde.ca.gov.

05:21:41.700 --> 05:21:45.700
Someone is standing by to respond to any email inquiries.

05:21:47.060 --> 05:21:50.540
So with all of that said, that was a lot.

05:21:50.540 --> 05:21:52.300
Thank you for your patience.

05:21:52.300 --> 05:21:55.100
The CDE recommends that the board review

05:21:55.100 --> 05:21:58.740
the draft state literacy plan and provide feedback.

05:21:58.740 --> 05:22:00.020
And of course,

05:22:00.020 --> 05:22:03.300
I'd be happy to take any questions that you may have.

05:22:06.300 --> 05:22:07.700
Thank you very much,

05:22:09.020 --> 05:22:11.140
both for all the work that has gone on

05:22:11.140 --> 05:22:13.100
over this last year and change

05:22:13.100 --> 05:22:16.420
and for the very, very thorough presentation.

05:22:18.100 --> 05:22:21.100
We want to display the public comment slide.

05:22:22.740 --> 05:22:24.060
Thank you.

05:22:24.060 --> 05:22:26.540
So that people can get into the queue.

05:22:26.540 --> 05:22:28.780
Members of the public wishing to provide comment

05:22:28.780 --> 05:22:32.540
on this item may do so by calling the number on the slide

05:22:32.540 --> 05:22:35.100
and entering the access code noted there.

05:22:36.060 --> 05:22:39.660
While we are waiting for, did the slide just disappear?

05:22:39.660 --> 05:22:43.580
Yes, that was my putting it back.

05:22:43.580 --> 05:22:44.900
Okay, great.

05:22:44.900 --> 05:22:45.740
Thank you.

05:22:46.900 --> 05:22:49.300
While we're waiting for members of the public to call in,

05:22:49.300 --> 05:22:51.420
I can ask Vice President Strauss

05:22:51.420 --> 05:22:53.540
if she has any initial comments.

05:22:53.540 --> 05:22:57.180
And then if the board members have any clarifying questions,

05:22:57.180 --> 05:23:00.300
we'll take those before we go to public comment

05:23:00.300 --> 05:23:02.980
and we'll come back for more discussion.

05:23:02.980 --> 05:23:04.980
So Vice President Strauss,

05:23:04.980 --> 05:23:07.540
do you want to offer any framing comments?

05:23:07.540 --> 05:23:10.580
Let me just say to Barbara and her entire team

05:23:10.580 --> 05:23:12.660
and the West Ed support,

05:23:12.660 --> 05:23:14.380
this has been an amazing process.

05:23:14.380 --> 05:23:17.100
And I would say I was at that late March,

05:23:17.100 --> 05:23:19.700
first Zoom remote planning meeting.

05:23:19.700 --> 05:23:23.300
It was a model for what to do in Zoom,

05:23:23.300 --> 05:23:26.940
but the team that gave input, this literacy team,

05:23:26.940 --> 05:23:30.620
it's an amazing team of educators

05:23:30.620 --> 05:23:33.740
that was thoughtful and comprehensive in their approach.

05:23:34.380 --> 05:23:36.860
The plans continue to get better

05:23:36.860 --> 05:23:38.980
and more comprehensive and more integrated.

05:23:38.980 --> 05:23:41.660
So first, let me just say,

05:23:41.660 --> 05:23:44.460
the stakeholder input has made it better

05:23:44.460 --> 05:23:48.780
and the CDE team led by Barbara has been really open

05:23:48.780 --> 05:23:51.540
and collaborative with the stakeholders.

05:23:51.540 --> 05:23:55.740
So we are developing what will be a guidance document

05:23:55.740 --> 05:23:58.780
really of what literacy is about,

05:23:58.780 --> 05:24:02.140
integrating student English learner resources,

05:24:02.140 --> 05:24:04.020
students with dyslexia.

05:24:04.020 --> 05:24:07.700
It's a wonderful document and it's really come a long way.

05:24:07.700 --> 05:24:10.300
So a credit to the entire process.

05:24:10.300 --> 05:24:12.940
I just want to highlight a couple of things.

05:24:12.940 --> 05:24:16.220
It addresses grade bands, so birth to age five,

05:24:16.220 --> 05:24:19.660
TK through five, and six to 12.

05:24:19.660 --> 05:24:21.060
And having participated,

05:24:21.060 --> 05:24:23.780
I was actually on the secondary group.

05:24:23.780 --> 05:24:26.420
Each area really looked at the developmental needs

05:24:26.420 --> 05:24:29.980
of students and particular aligned strategies.

05:24:29.980 --> 05:24:34.060
So while we're delighted to get this grant

05:24:34.060 --> 05:24:37.140
and to look at piloting projects,

05:24:37.140 --> 05:24:39.780
both at a county office and local districts,

05:24:39.780 --> 05:24:41.860
I'm really hoping this will help inform our work

05:24:41.860 --> 05:24:44.660
in literacy going forward statewide,

05:24:44.660 --> 05:24:47.660
because this is a model that the county office

05:24:47.660 --> 05:24:51.100
have to write their grants to this plan.

05:24:51.100 --> 05:24:53.940
But going forward, as we look at supporting students

05:24:53.940 --> 05:24:55.500
with strong literacy development,

05:24:55.500 --> 05:24:58.700
an integrated plan like this really is a model,

05:24:58.700 --> 05:25:02.140
kind of makes me think of our early item this morning,

05:25:02.140 --> 05:25:04.540
where we're looking at trying to integrate documents

05:25:04.540 --> 05:25:06.140
to provide guidance of field.

05:25:06.140 --> 05:25:10.140
And I just think this whole plan provides that as well.

05:25:10.140 --> 05:25:12.620
And a highlight to our ELA ELD framework,

05:25:12.620 --> 05:25:16.020
our English learner roadmap and the dyslexia guidelines,

05:25:16.020 --> 05:25:18.500
I think these are integrated well into the process.

05:25:18.500 --> 05:25:21.900
And I think that's actually really, really important.

05:25:21.900 --> 05:25:24.340
And I just appreciate the comment Barb

05:25:24.340 --> 05:25:26.620
on best first instruction.

05:25:26.620 --> 05:25:27.540
That's what we're talking about,

05:25:27.540 --> 05:25:30.100
that all students get best first instruction

05:25:30.100 --> 05:25:31.540
using these tools.

05:25:31.540 --> 05:25:34.180
We know a lot more now than we did before

05:25:34.180 --> 05:25:36.460
on how to do best first instruction,

05:25:36.460 --> 05:25:37.420
how to integrate this.

05:25:37.420 --> 05:25:40.300
And so I think this plan really sets the stage.

05:25:40.300 --> 05:25:44.860
So having been at the two literacy team meetings

05:25:44.860 --> 05:25:46.020
and then at the IQC,

05:25:46.020 --> 05:25:48.580
I've just watched this get developing better.

05:25:48.580 --> 05:25:51.380
And I'm really looking forward to seeing the final plan

05:25:51.380 --> 05:25:52.620
at our March meeting,

05:25:52.620 --> 05:25:55.540
and then the rollout and actually implementation of it.

05:25:55.540 --> 05:25:58.420
So thank you very much for the continued work.

05:25:58.420 --> 05:25:59.260
Thank you.

05:26:01.620 --> 05:26:02.460
All right.

05:26:04.020 --> 05:26:05.940
Are there any clarifying questions

05:26:05.940 --> 05:26:08.660
about the content of the presentation

05:26:08.660 --> 05:26:10.540
before we go to public comment?

05:26:11.420 --> 05:26:16.300
I think I see member Sun with a hand up.

05:26:16.300 --> 05:26:17.420
Yes, thank you.

05:26:17.420 --> 05:26:20.220
Yeah, I just have a question related to

05:26:21.220 --> 05:26:24.300
how these grants might fit in

05:26:24.300 --> 05:26:27.820
with our statewide system of support.

05:26:28.900 --> 05:26:30.500
I know it's gonna be related,

05:26:30.500 --> 05:26:33.540
but how do we tie it and how do we make the dotted line

05:26:33.540 --> 05:26:37.740
to these county offices that will be receiving these grants

05:26:37.740 --> 05:26:40.140
and how utilizing that in that system?

05:26:41.060 --> 05:26:42.340
Thank you for that question

05:26:42.340 --> 05:26:46.020
because that was built into the proposal

05:26:46.020 --> 05:26:48.940
and remains a huge piece of what it is

05:26:49.020 --> 05:26:50.300
we're trying to accomplish here.

05:26:50.300 --> 05:26:55.220
So as those seven subgrantees work with the schools

05:26:55.220 --> 05:26:58.140
and districts that they're funded to support,

05:26:58.140 --> 05:27:01.500
our hope is that they'll be learning a lot,

05:27:01.500 --> 05:27:05.180
like going deep, not just with literacy,

05:27:05.180 --> 05:27:07.900
comprehensive literacy, that's a given,

05:27:07.900 --> 05:27:11.300
but to be able to go deep around one of those seven priorities

05:27:11.300 --> 05:27:15.380
and learn and create resources and learn lessons

05:27:15.380 --> 05:27:19.020
that we can then bubble up

05:27:19.020 --> 05:27:21.460
to the larger statewide system of support.

05:27:21.460 --> 05:27:25.540
A different literacy effort

05:27:25.540 --> 05:27:27.460
that California is implementing right now,

05:27:27.460 --> 05:27:30.340
the Early Literacy Support Block Grants,

05:27:30.340 --> 05:27:34.380
provides for an expert lead in literacy

05:27:34.380 --> 05:27:39.300
who also works with us in our division very closely.

05:27:39.300 --> 05:27:42.860
So we are part of the system of support.

05:27:42.860 --> 05:27:44.620
We are working with the expert lead

05:27:44.620 --> 05:27:48.340
and between the repositories and the resources

05:27:48.340 --> 05:27:50.260
and the expert lead and our involvement

05:27:50.260 --> 05:27:51.380
in the system of support,

05:27:51.380 --> 05:27:54.620
our intent is to ensure that the learning

05:27:54.620 --> 05:27:57.500
that's happening with those seven subgrantees

05:27:57.500 --> 05:27:59.620
bubbles up and is integrated

05:27:59.620 --> 05:28:01.500
into the larger system of support

05:28:01.500 --> 05:28:03.620
that we'll be able to share more widely

05:28:03.620 --> 05:28:06.580
far beyond those seven subgrantees.

05:28:06.580 --> 05:28:07.820
So thank you for that question

05:28:07.820 --> 05:28:10.020
because pulling all those pieces together,

05:28:11.380 --> 05:28:12.900
as I noted early on,

05:28:12.940 --> 05:28:17.420
the CDE staff who have taken on the coordinating role

05:28:17.420 --> 05:28:19.580
have got a lot of coordinating to do,

05:28:19.580 --> 05:28:21.780
but I'm feeling very confident in our ability

05:28:21.780 --> 05:28:24.740
to share some really great stuff.

05:28:24.740 --> 05:28:25.980
Thank you.

05:28:25.980 --> 05:28:26.820
Thank you.

05:28:26.820 --> 05:28:27.700
Thank you for clarifying that

05:28:27.700 --> 05:28:30.020
and we'll go to public comment now.

05:28:30.020 --> 05:28:31.860
Is there any public comment?

05:28:31.860 --> 05:28:34.660
Yes, it looks like we have about 30 people

05:28:34.660 --> 05:28:38.260
in the queue for public comment and this is for item six.

05:28:38.260 --> 05:28:40.020
I will open up the phone line now.

05:28:40.980 --> 05:28:42.820
Good afternoon.

05:28:42.820 --> 05:28:45.340
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:28:45.340 --> 05:28:46.180
You have one minute.

05:28:46.180 --> 05:28:47.340
Your time starts now.

05:28:51.460 --> 05:28:53.060
Hi, good afternoon.

05:28:53.060 --> 05:28:55.380
I'm Jennifer Deal and I'm here

05:28:55.380 --> 05:28:57.860
on behalf of Californians Together.

05:28:57.860 --> 05:29:00.900
As a veteran educator of both primary and upper grades,

05:29:00.900 --> 05:29:02.380
I'd like to draw your attention

05:29:02.380 --> 05:29:05.580
to the TK-5 portion of the SLP.

05:29:05.580 --> 05:29:06.780
As it's currently drafted,

05:29:06.820 --> 05:29:08.860
this section focuses primarily

05:29:08.860 --> 05:29:11.980
on the early literacy needs of TK-1 students.

05:29:11.980 --> 05:29:15.220
However, we know students in grades two through five

05:29:15.220 --> 05:29:16.940
have unique instructional needs

05:29:16.940 --> 05:29:20.380
in order to access increasingly complex texts.

05:29:20.380 --> 05:29:23.500
For example, when engaging with informational texts,

05:29:23.500 --> 05:29:27.460
TK-1 students gather information from provided sources

05:29:27.460 --> 05:29:31.020
to answer a question with guidance and support,

05:29:31.020 --> 05:29:34.540
whereas 4-5 students must draw evidence from texts

05:29:34.540 --> 05:29:39.340
to support analysis, reflection, and research.

05:29:39.340 --> 05:29:41.300
My ask isn't controversial.

05:29:41.300 --> 05:29:43.860
Yeah, it isn't small or inconsequential.

05:29:43.860 --> 05:29:46.220
Please incorporate the needs of students

05:29:46.220 --> 05:29:47.660
in second through fifth grade

05:29:47.660 --> 05:29:50.660
into the TK-5 portion of the SLP.

05:29:50.660 --> 05:29:53.500
Thank you so much for your work and time.

05:29:53.500 --> 05:29:54.340
Thank you.

05:29:56.860 --> 05:29:57.700
Good afternoon.

05:29:57.700 --> 05:29:59.380
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:29:59.380 --> 05:30:00.220
You have one minute.

05:30:00.220 --> 05:30:01.300
Your time starts now.

05:30:02.140 --> 05:30:05.140
My name is Gisela O'Brien,

05:30:05.140 --> 05:30:07.740
Biliteracy and EL Education Specialist

05:30:07.740 --> 05:30:10.140
at the Center for Equity for English Learners

05:30:10.140 --> 05:30:11.700
and Affiliated Faculty

05:30:11.700 --> 05:30:15.540
in the Department of Educational Leadership at the LMU.

05:30:15.540 --> 05:30:18.020
I'm here to urge you to add ELD

05:30:18.020 --> 05:30:20.820
to the statewide literacy priority areas

05:30:20.820 --> 05:30:23.220
for TK through 12th grade.

05:30:23.220 --> 05:30:25.420
We know that despite new policies

05:30:25.420 --> 05:30:29.660
and take time for ELD,

05:30:29.660 --> 05:30:31.740
both designated and integrated.

05:30:31.740 --> 05:30:34.100
However, the findings from my research

05:30:34.100 --> 05:30:36.660
and that of my colleague, William Saunders,

05:30:36.660 --> 05:30:39.980
as well as our review of the literature on ELD indicate,

05:30:39.980 --> 05:30:42.500
one, focused ELD instruction

05:30:42.500 --> 05:30:45.500
makes consistent and significant differences.

05:30:45.500 --> 05:30:48.460
Two, teachers that consistently instruct ELD

05:30:48.460 --> 05:30:50.660
during a designated block of time

05:30:50.660 --> 05:30:53.700
devote more time to help in early education

05:30:53.700 --> 05:30:58.620
and to get as well as show higher gains in those areas.

05:30:58.660 --> 05:31:00.100
Moreover, there is evidence

05:31:00.100 --> 05:31:02.020
that suggests a strong relationship

05:31:02.020 --> 05:31:04.220
between higher or efficient

05:31:04.220 --> 05:31:07.860
and successful acquisition of early reading and writing.

05:31:07.860 --> 05:31:11.020
Similarly, ELD instruction across the grades

05:31:11.020 --> 05:31:14.380
that provides opportunity for small group output growth

05:31:14.380 --> 05:31:15.660
and vocabulary instruction

05:31:15.660 --> 05:31:18.260
is effective in accelerating acquisition.

05:31:18.260 --> 05:31:19.100
Thank you.

05:31:22.580 --> 05:31:23.420
Good afternoon.

05:31:23.420 --> 05:31:25.220
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:31:25.220 --> 05:31:26.060
You have one minute.

05:31:26.060 --> 05:31:27.060
Your time starts now.

05:31:29.300 --> 05:31:30.140
Good afternoon.

05:31:30.140 --> 05:31:31.580
My name is Carla Herrera,

05:31:31.580 --> 05:31:34.340
a Biliteracy Educator for over 45 years

05:31:34.340 --> 05:31:36.500
and former IQC member.

05:31:36.500 --> 05:31:40.020
I was vice chair of the ELA ELD SMC

05:31:40.020 --> 05:31:41.620
in the room where it happened

05:31:41.620 --> 05:31:43.100
during the framework development

05:31:43.100 --> 05:31:46.580
of the five interconnected circles of implementation,

05:31:46.580 --> 05:31:48.860
expanding our teaching strategies

05:31:48.860 --> 05:31:52.300
to develop oral language and meaning making for students

05:31:52.300 --> 05:31:53.940
to become literate and fluent,

05:31:53.940 --> 05:31:56.740
including and especially English learners.

05:31:56.740 --> 05:31:58.820
I'm here to caution and overemphasis

05:31:58.820 --> 05:32:00.500
on phonics instruction

05:32:00.500 --> 05:32:02.140
and recall lessons from the past

05:32:02.140 --> 05:32:06.340
as we have repeated this discussion every 15 to 20 years.

05:32:06.340 --> 05:32:07.980
The excitement of hearing children

05:32:07.980 --> 05:32:09.500
sound out words falls flat

05:32:09.500 --> 05:32:11.260
when asked about what they have just read

05:32:11.260 --> 05:32:15.020
and they respond, I don't know, with a blank stare.

05:32:15.020 --> 05:32:18.540
I urge you to ensure a more comprehensive focus

05:32:18.540 --> 05:32:21.860
on literacy aligned with all five themes of the framework

05:32:21.860 --> 05:32:25.100
and grants awarded to implement the SLP.

05:32:25.100 --> 05:32:26.420
Instead of I don't know,

05:32:27.380 --> 05:32:29.140
let me tell you about what I read

05:32:29.140 --> 05:32:31.980
and I can write about it in two languages.

05:32:31.980 --> 05:32:32.820
Thank you.

05:32:32.820 --> 05:32:33.660
Thank you.

05:32:36.420 --> 05:32:37.260
Good afternoon.

05:32:37.260 --> 05:32:38.980
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:32:38.980 --> 05:32:39.820
Do you have one minute?

05:32:39.820 --> 05:32:41.100
Your time starts now.

05:32:42.340 --> 05:32:43.180
Good afternoon.

05:32:43.180 --> 05:32:45.300
I'm Lily Ruvalcaba, English Learner Tosa

05:32:45.300 --> 05:32:46.580
with Mountain View School District

05:32:46.580 --> 05:32:48.180
and Californians Together.

05:32:48.180 --> 05:32:49.580
I'm here today to implore you

05:32:49.580 --> 05:32:51.460
to call out the importance of developing

05:32:51.460 --> 05:32:52.900
all four language domains

05:32:52.900 --> 05:32:55.540
when it comes to literacy development for ELD.

05:32:55.540 --> 05:32:58.580
Research shows that ELDs need more than foundational skills

05:32:58.580 --> 05:33:00.300
as evidenced by research included

05:33:00.300 --> 05:33:03.020
in the 2006 National Literacy Panel

05:33:03.020 --> 05:33:05.420
for Language Minority Children and Youth Report

05:33:05.420 --> 05:33:06.980
which concluded the following,

05:33:06.980 --> 05:33:09.100
that while components of teaching reading skills

05:33:09.100 --> 05:33:10.700
are important for all children,

05:33:10.700 --> 05:33:12.700
they are not sufficient for ELDs

05:33:12.700 --> 05:33:14.300
and when made the cornerstone

05:33:14.300 --> 05:33:16.740
and sole focus of language arts instruction

05:33:16.740 --> 05:33:18.700
results in a growing achievement gap.

05:33:18.700 --> 05:33:20.460
Having worked with ELDs for 30 years

05:33:20.460 --> 05:33:21.940
as an elementary teacher,

05:33:21.940 --> 05:33:23.740
I've witnessed the benefits of developing

05:33:23.740 --> 05:33:25.700
all four domains of language and literacy

05:33:25.700 --> 05:33:28.020
within the context of the content.

05:33:28.020 --> 05:33:31.180
ELDs must develop schema and content knowledge

05:33:31.180 --> 05:33:33.300
through meaningful language experiences,

05:33:33.300 --> 05:33:36.020
utilizing the four domains while they learn to decode

05:33:36.020 --> 05:33:38.020
or they will not be effective readers.

05:33:38.020 --> 05:33:40.940
Once again, ELDs need more than foundational skills

05:33:40.940 --> 05:33:42.620
when it comes to literacy instruction

05:33:42.620 --> 05:33:45.540
as they must learn a new language and grade level content

05:33:45.540 --> 05:33:47.860
while simultaneously learning to read.

05:33:47.860 --> 05:33:48.700
Thank you.

05:33:48.700 --> 05:33:49.520
Thank you.

05:33:50.000 --> 05:33:50.840
Thank you.

05:33:52.840 --> 05:33:53.680
Good afternoon.

05:33:53.680 --> 05:33:55.680
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:33:55.680 --> 05:33:56.520
You have one minute.

05:33:56.520 --> 05:33:57.600
Your time starts now.

05:33:58.880 --> 05:34:00.160
Good afternoon.

05:34:00.160 --> 05:34:03.560
I am Alisa Arrigoza representing Californians Together.

05:34:03.560 --> 05:34:05.160
I am a teacher on special assignment

05:34:05.160 --> 05:34:07.160
for the Mountain View School District in Ohlone, California

05:34:07.160 --> 05:34:09.800
providing support to teachers head start through sixth grade.

05:34:09.800 --> 05:34:11.520
I've been a bilingual educator for 30 years

05:34:11.520 --> 05:34:12.720
and have the opportunity to work

05:34:12.720 --> 05:34:14.240
on the state literacy plan team this year

05:34:14.240 --> 05:34:15.960
in the birth to age five group.

05:34:15.960 --> 05:34:17.640
We appreciate the following recommendations

05:34:17.680 --> 05:34:20.160
that have been incorporated within the state literacy plan.

05:34:20.160 --> 05:34:21.600
In the birth to five section,

05:34:21.600 --> 05:34:22.720
you have the following revisions

05:34:22.720 --> 05:34:24.120
that support dual language learners,

05:34:24.120 --> 05:34:26.200
including language regarding bi-literacy

05:34:26.200 --> 05:34:27.520
from state guidance and policies

05:34:27.520 --> 05:34:28.960
was added to the introduction

05:34:28.960 --> 05:34:30.920
and in the birth to age five section.

05:34:30.920 --> 05:34:33.600
Information regarding the ELD desired results,

05:34:33.600 --> 05:34:35.920
developmental profile, the DRDPs and guidance

05:34:35.920 --> 05:34:37.640
for observation and documentation

05:34:37.640 --> 05:34:40.520
of young dual language learners was added to this section

05:34:40.520 --> 05:34:42.440
and the assessment systems section

05:34:42.440 --> 05:34:44.600
of the comprehensive and integrated literacy model.

05:34:44.600 --> 05:34:46.840
Language was added to the English learner roadmap section

05:34:46.840 --> 05:34:47.960
to clarify its application

05:34:47.960 --> 05:34:49.920
from early childhood to grade 12.

05:34:49.920 --> 05:34:51.960
Teacher preparation for early childhood education

05:34:51.960 --> 05:34:53.200
will be added to the comprehensive

05:34:53.200 --> 05:34:54.920
and integrated literacy model.

05:34:54.920 --> 05:34:56.600
Thank you for incorporating our recommendations

05:34:56.600 --> 05:34:58.520
toward creating a more comprehensive document,

05:34:58.520 --> 05:35:00.800
keeping our youngest learners in mind.

05:35:00.800 --> 05:35:01.640
Thank you.

05:35:06.920 --> 05:35:07.760
Good afternoon.

05:35:07.760 --> 05:35:09.720
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:35:09.720 --> 05:35:10.560
Do you have one minute?

05:35:10.560 --> 05:35:11.560
Your time starts now.

05:35:12.880 --> 05:35:13.840
I am Lori DePole

05:35:13.840 --> 05:35:16.320
and I provide volunteer literacy tutoring

05:35:16.320 --> 05:35:17.600
to foster youth.

05:35:17.600 --> 05:35:18.960
I have significant concerns

05:35:18.960 --> 05:35:20.920
about the state literacy plan.

05:35:20.920 --> 05:35:23.040
CDE and its federal grant application

05:35:23.040 --> 05:35:24.680
committed that it would one,

05:35:24.680 --> 05:35:27.240
provide educators and school administrators

05:35:27.240 --> 05:35:29.640
with a coherent literacy vision,

05:35:29.640 --> 05:35:31.560
two, provide recommendations

05:35:31.560 --> 05:35:34.000
and a plan for state and regional leads,

05:35:34.000 --> 05:35:36.600
and three, highlight comprehensive information

05:35:36.600 --> 05:35:38.640
regarding evidence-based strategies

05:35:38.640 --> 05:35:40.280
for literacy instruction.

05:35:40.280 --> 05:35:42.960
The current plan is drafted does not do this.

05:35:42.960 --> 05:35:45.400
It is not a coherent literacy plan.

05:35:45.400 --> 05:35:47.160
It is merely a high level summary

05:35:47.160 --> 05:35:50.080
of existing policy frameworks and guidelines,

05:35:50.080 --> 05:35:52.520
many of which do not currently align.

05:35:52.520 --> 05:35:54.680
The plan literally cross references

05:35:54.680 --> 05:35:58.320
over 5900 pages of such policies.

05:35:58.320 --> 05:36:00.520
The plan does not address the needs identified

05:36:00.520 --> 05:36:02.360
in the statewide needs survey.

05:36:02.360 --> 05:36:04.040
We have a state literacy crisis

05:36:04.040 --> 05:36:07.240
and this draft plan does not provide clear direction

05:36:07.240 --> 05:36:09.920
as to how to incorporate the science of reading

05:36:09.920 --> 05:36:11.800
into our state's classrooms

05:36:11.800 --> 05:36:14.880
and work towards closing our significant literacy gap.

05:36:14.880 --> 05:36:15.960
Thank you for your time.

05:36:15.960 --> 05:36:16.800
Thank you.

05:36:19.320 --> 05:36:20.160
Good afternoon.

05:36:20.160 --> 05:36:21.800
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:36:21.800 --> 05:36:22.640
You have one minute.

05:36:22.640 --> 05:36:23.840
Your time starts now.

05:36:25.560 --> 05:36:26.400
Good afternoon.

05:36:26.400 --> 05:36:27.520
My name is Sharice Guerra

05:36:27.520 --> 05:36:30.720
and I'm here to testify on behalf of Californians Together

05:36:30.720 --> 05:36:33.320
and I work for the Subrata Early Academic Language

05:36:33.320 --> 05:36:34.400
field model.

05:36:34.400 --> 05:36:35.920
We are concerned about the requirement

05:36:35.920 --> 05:36:37.880
to administer universal screening

05:36:37.880 --> 05:36:40.640
for dyslexia to all kindergarten students.

05:36:40.640 --> 05:36:42.840
Screening for dyslexia is not the same

05:36:42.880 --> 05:36:46.360
as screening for some party good literacy instruction.

05:36:46.360 --> 05:36:50.280
A universal screen for dyslexia is to identify pathology

05:36:50.280 --> 05:36:53.560
and should be based upon teachers identifying students

05:36:53.560 --> 05:36:55.640
who might be struggling with literacy.

05:36:55.640 --> 05:36:58.360
As a parent of children who were in a 90-10

05:36:58.360 --> 05:37:02.080
Spanish dual language program, I have a major concern.

05:37:02.080 --> 05:37:04.520
Some phonemes are different in English than Spanish.

05:37:04.520 --> 05:37:06.920
If he took this screener, he may have been identified

05:37:06.920 --> 05:37:08.480
as having dyslexia.

05:37:08.480 --> 05:37:10.360
Not because he's struggling in reading

05:37:10.360 --> 05:37:12.320
but because he hasn't been taught.

05:37:12.360 --> 05:37:15.280
A universal screener could lead to over-identification,

05:37:15.280 --> 05:37:17.960
especially for students who do not speak English.

05:37:17.960 --> 05:37:20.000
For students that are making normal progress

05:37:20.000 --> 05:37:21.600
and are not struggling to read,

05:37:21.600 --> 05:37:23.760
whether in English or another language,

05:37:23.760 --> 05:37:26.760
this assessment for dyslexia is not necessary.

05:37:26.760 --> 05:37:27.580
Thank you.

05:37:27.580 --> 05:37:28.420
Thank you.

05:37:31.560 --> 05:37:32.400
Good afternoon.

05:37:32.400 --> 05:37:34.080
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:37:34.080 --> 05:37:34.920
You have one minute.

05:37:34.920 --> 05:37:35.920
Your time starts now.

05:37:37.200 --> 05:37:38.040
Good afternoon.

05:37:38.040 --> 05:37:39.560
My name is Jorge Pacheco, Junior President

05:37:39.560 --> 05:37:41.960
of both the California Latino School Boards Association

05:37:41.960 --> 05:37:44.080
as well as the Oak Grove School District Board of Education

05:37:44.080 --> 05:37:46.920
and the current elementary ethnic studies bilingual teacher.

05:37:46.920 --> 05:37:49.280
Any literacy framework must explicitly center

05:37:49.280 --> 05:37:51.200
culturally sustaining and relevant pedagogy

05:37:51.200 --> 05:37:53.560
as a priority for all TK to 12 students,

05:37:53.560 --> 05:37:55.440
not just grades six to 12.

05:37:55.440 --> 05:37:58.320
With over 77% of our state student population being of color

05:37:58.320 --> 05:38:01.120
and almost 20% being English language learners,

05:38:01.120 --> 05:38:03.440
literacy instruction must center our state's great ethnic,

05:38:03.440 --> 05:38:05.120
racial, and linguistic diversity.

05:38:05.120 --> 05:38:06.720
And doing so in the state literacy plan

05:38:06.720 --> 05:38:08.320
would be a vital place to start.

05:38:08.320 --> 05:38:10.680
As a mixed-race Korean, Maya Salvadoran English learner

05:38:10.760 --> 05:38:12.640
myself, I almost didn't graduate high school

05:38:12.640 --> 05:38:14.760
and spent years in community college learning the literacy

05:38:14.760 --> 05:38:17.920
that I was supposed to have been taught in my K-12 education.

05:38:17.920 --> 05:38:20.120
What I needed as a kid was a pedagogy that would have kept

05:38:20.120 --> 05:38:22.600
me engaged in education, reading about my own histories

05:38:22.600 --> 05:38:24.360
and seeing myself as an intellectual

05:38:24.360 --> 05:38:25.520
rather than a problem.

05:38:25.520 --> 05:38:27.520
Unfortunately stories like mine are still all too common

05:38:27.520 --> 05:38:29.560
and many English learners are still not making out

05:38:29.560 --> 05:38:32.360
of the school to prison pipeline like how I barely did.

05:38:32.360 --> 05:38:34.720
Help our kids succeed by explicitly centering culture

05:38:34.720 --> 05:38:36.320
and sustaining and relevant pedagogy

05:38:36.320 --> 05:38:39.120
into the state literacy plan for TK to five

05:38:39.160 --> 05:38:42.400
so that all of our students succeed in our public schools.

05:38:42.400 --> 05:38:43.240
Thank you.

05:38:43.240 --> 05:38:44.060
Thank you.

05:38:46.040 --> 05:38:47.320
Good afternoon, please state your name

05:38:47.320 --> 05:38:48.680
and affiliation for the record.

05:38:48.680 --> 05:38:50.880
You have one minute, your time starts now.

05:38:52.000 --> 05:38:54.600
Good afternoon, my name is Karina Sapien.

05:38:54.600 --> 05:38:56.280
I work for SEAL and I'm here to speak

05:38:56.280 --> 05:38:58.280
on behalf of Californians Together.

05:38:58.280 --> 05:39:00.880
I have been a public school educator for over 30 years,

05:39:00.880 --> 05:39:03.800
including seven years as an elementary principal.

05:39:03.800 --> 05:39:05.480
We assert that attention must be paid

05:39:05.480 --> 05:39:07.560
to students' oral language proficiency

05:39:07.600 --> 05:39:09.320
as students are expected to read.

05:39:09.320 --> 05:39:10.600
As mentioned in the letter submitted

05:39:10.600 --> 05:39:13.600
to the State Board of Education by Professor Goldenberg,

05:39:13.600 --> 05:39:16.680
reading proficiency is a function of two sets of skills.

05:39:16.680 --> 05:39:19.480
One, accurate and fluent work recognition

05:39:19.480 --> 05:39:22.040
and two, adequate language proficiency

05:39:22.040 --> 05:39:24.360
to comprehend text being read.

05:39:24.360 --> 05:39:26.400
Without both of these skills working together,

05:39:26.400 --> 05:39:28.400
just a narrow focus on one will lead

05:39:28.400 --> 05:39:30.520
to widening gaps in achievement.

05:39:30.520 --> 05:39:34.040
As principal, I saw firsthand how a narrow focus

05:39:34.040 --> 05:39:36.400
on foundational skills produced great decoders

05:39:36.400 --> 05:39:38.920
in the early grades, only to see our English learners

05:39:38.920 --> 05:39:41.360
fall behind as they progressed through the grades.

05:39:41.360 --> 05:39:42.200
Why?

05:39:42.200 --> 05:39:44.120
Because intentional oral language practice

05:39:44.120 --> 05:39:46.080
critical to building language proficiency

05:39:46.080 --> 05:39:48.600
and reading comprehension was neglected.

05:39:48.600 --> 05:39:51.000
We've been there before with no child left behind

05:39:51.000 --> 05:39:52.960
and we all know that our English learners

05:39:52.960 --> 05:39:55.040
were in fact left behind.

05:39:55.040 --> 05:39:56.920
We urge you to include oral language

05:39:56.920 --> 05:40:00.280
as an equally essential component of literacy instruction.

05:40:00.280 --> 05:40:01.120
Thank you.

05:40:01.120 --> 05:40:01.940
Thank you.

05:40:03.960 --> 05:40:05.320
Good afternoon, please state your name

05:40:05.320 --> 05:40:06.880
and affiliation for the record.

05:40:06.880 --> 05:40:09.080
You have one minute, your time starts now.

05:40:17.440 --> 05:40:18.880
Hello, caller, are you there?

05:40:21.200 --> 05:40:23.120
Okay, moving on to the next caller.

05:40:24.720 --> 05:40:26.840
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:40:26.840 --> 05:40:29.000
You have one minute, your time starts now.

05:40:30.360 --> 05:40:32.560
Good afternoon, my name is Ruth Barajas

05:40:32.560 --> 05:40:34.920
and I'm a former elementary school principal

05:40:34.960 --> 05:40:38.280
and teacher and I'm calling with Californians Together.

05:40:38.280 --> 05:40:40.520
We appreciate the reference to ELD

05:40:40.520 --> 05:40:43.880
in the state literacy plan that has been augmented

05:40:43.880 --> 05:40:46.840
and clarifies that designated and integrated ELD

05:40:46.840 --> 05:40:49.640
is a legal requirement and therefore it's something

05:40:49.640 --> 05:40:53.560
that all LEAs shall provide as opposed to should do.

05:40:54.640 --> 05:40:57.480
Also, we are very happy to see that the section

05:40:57.480 --> 05:41:00.240
on designated and integrated English language development

05:41:00.240 --> 05:41:03.760
has also been augmented and makes clear

05:41:03.760 --> 05:41:07.080
that it is incumbent on every California educator

05:41:07.080 --> 05:41:08.880
to understand California's model

05:41:08.880 --> 05:41:11.360
of comprehensive ELD instruction.

05:41:11.360 --> 05:41:13.280
Thank you for all of this work.

05:41:13.280 --> 05:41:14.120
Thank you.

05:41:16.680 --> 05:41:18.120
Good afternoon, please state your name

05:41:18.120 --> 05:41:19.480
and affiliation for the record.

05:41:19.480 --> 05:41:21.680
You have one minute, your time starts now.

05:41:23.080 --> 05:41:25.360
Good afternoon, I'm Marta Hernandez

05:41:25.360 --> 05:41:26.800
with Californians Together

05:41:26.800 --> 05:41:30.120
and we wish to thank Barbara Murchison and her team.

05:41:30.120 --> 05:41:33.400
We appreciate the expanded focus on bi-literacy

05:41:33.400 --> 05:41:37.120
including added references to dual language resources

05:41:37.120 --> 05:41:39.960
including the new CVE publication

05:41:39.960 --> 05:41:42.560
improving education for multilingual

05:41:42.560 --> 05:41:44.400
and English learner students.

05:41:44.400 --> 05:41:48.160
We also appreciate the clarification that literacy

05:41:48.160 --> 05:41:51.840
also refers to bi-literacy throughout the plan.

05:41:51.840 --> 05:41:54.240
There is an enhanced description of the importance

05:41:54.240 --> 05:41:57.400
of the five key literacy cross-cutting theme

05:41:57.400 --> 05:42:00.000
described earlier by Yali Yopp

05:42:00.000 --> 05:42:02.400
and the explicit language that asserts

05:42:02.440 --> 05:42:04.560
that foundational skills are necessary

05:42:04.560 --> 05:42:08.920
but not sufficient for all students to develop literacy.

05:42:08.920 --> 05:42:11.000
As described by Hallie earlier,

05:42:11.000 --> 05:42:13.760
ELA and ELD are interconnected

05:42:13.760 --> 05:42:15.280
and for English learners,

05:42:15.280 --> 05:42:18.520
ELD is a necessary literacy component.

05:42:18.520 --> 05:42:21.440
Literacy experts should have a more comprehensive

05:42:21.440 --> 05:42:24.000
literacy focus and all five themes

05:42:24.000 --> 05:42:28.000
and ELD, PK-12 need to be a component

05:42:28.000 --> 05:42:30.280
of all grants awarded to implement

05:42:30.280 --> 05:42:33.280
the California Comprehensive State Literacy Plan.

05:42:33.280 --> 05:42:34.400
Thank you very much.

05:42:34.400 --> 05:42:35.240
Thank you.

05:42:37.040 --> 05:42:37.880
Good afternoon.

05:42:37.880 --> 05:42:40.160
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:42:40.160 --> 05:42:41.000
You have one minute.

05:42:41.000 --> 05:42:41.960
Your time starts now.

05:42:52.320 --> 05:42:53.160
Good afternoon.

05:42:53.160 --> 05:42:55.040
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:42:55.040 --> 05:42:55.880
You have one minute.

05:42:55.880 --> 05:42:56.840
Your time starts now.

05:42:58.040 --> 05:42:58.880
Good afternoon.

05:42:58.960 --> 05:43:01.280
This is Christy Hernandez representing the Los Angeles

05:43:01.280 --> 05:43:04.600
branch of the IDA International Dyslexia Association.

05:43:04.600 --> 05:43:06.600
The statewide needs survey shows

05:43:06.600 --> 05:43:09.040
that school districts overwhelmingly want to understand

05:43:09.040 --> 05:43:11.600
how to incorporate a structured literacy approach

05:43:11.600 --> 05:43:13.320
and the California Dyslexia Guidelines

05:43:13.320 --> 05:43:15.560
into their general education curriculum.

05:43:15.560 --> 05:43:18.000
The draft state literacy plan doesn't provide guidance

05:43:18.000 --> 05:43:19.200
on how to do so.

05:43:19.200 --> 05:43:21.160
The only language referring to structured literacy

05:43:21.160 --> 05:43:23.400
that appeared in the draft state literacy plan

05:43:23.400 --> 05:43:26.040
is on page 89 where it provides a description

05:43:26.040 --> 05:43:27.360
from the California education code

05:43:27.360 --> 05:43:29.920
and then refers to California Dyslexia Guidelines

05:43:29.920 --> 05:43:32.800
for more detailed information on dyslexia screening,

05:43:32.800 --> 05:43:34.320
assessment, and instruction.

05:43:34.320 --> 05:43:37.760
The needs assessment cited the IDA knowledge

05:43:37.760 --> 05:43:39.720
and practice standards for teachers of reading

05:43:39.720 --> 05:43:41.680
for the definition of structured literacy

05:43:41.680 --> 05:43:43.280
and yet the state literacy plan

05:43:43.280 --> 05:43:45.160
doesn't mention the IDA standards.

05:43:45.160 --> 05:43:47.120
We ask that you consider the IDA standards

05:43:47.120 --> 05:43:48.000
as you move forward.

05:43:48.000 --> 05:43:49.880
We appreciate all the hard work you are doing.

05:43:49.880 --> 05:43:50.800
Thank you.

05:43:50.800 --> 05:43:51.640
Thank you.

05:43:54.600 --> 05:43:55.440
Good afternoon.

05:43:55.440 --> 05:43:57.200
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:43:57.240 --> 05:43:58.080
You have one minute.

05:43:58.080 --> 05:43:58.920
Your time starts now.

05:44:01.320 --> 05:44:03.640
Hi, I'm Allison Berseno, associate professor

05:44:03.640 --> 05:44:05.240
at San Jose State University.

05:44:05.240 --> 05:44:07.680
Here on behalf of Californians Together,

05:44:07.680 --> 05:44:10.200
thank you to the committee for your wonderful work.

05:44:10.200 --> 05:44:11.960
While foundational skills are essential,

05:44:11.960 --> 05:44:14.240
the TK-II fifth grade section of the framework

05:44:14.240 --> 05:44:17.440
currently disproportionately focuses on foundational skills

05:44:17.440 --> 05:44:19.880
in relationship to the other four themes

05:44:19.880 --> 05:44:21.840
of the LA ELB framework,

05:44:21.840 --> 05:44:24.160
which are meaning making, language development,

05:44:24.160 --> 05:44:26.480
effective expression, and content knowledge.

05:44:26.480 --> 05:44:29.280
New research by California's own P. David Pearson

05:44:29.280 --> 05:44:30.960
and others demonstrates the importance

05:44:30.960 --> 05:44:32.240
of these other four themes

05:44:32.240 --> 05:44:35.160
in addition to foundational skills.

05:44:35.160 --> 05:44:37.680
Just as foundational skills are a precursor to literacy,

05:44:37.680 --> 05:44:39.360
so is language.

05:44:39.360 --> 05:44:42.680
California's LA ELB framework is admired across the country

05:44:42.680 --> 05:44:44.880
because it explicitly calls out that literacy

05:44:44.880 --> 05:44:47.200
is built on a foundation of language.

05:44:47.200 --> 05:44:49.760
The framework's over-reliance on foundational skills

05:44:49.760 --> 05:44:51.800
could move the state backwards in our attempt

05:44:51.800 --> 05:44:53.640
to ensure English learners have access

05:44:53.640 --> 05:44:56.160
to 21st century education.

05:44:56.160 --> 05:44:57.160
Thank you.

05:44:57.160 --> 05:44:58.000
Thank you.

05:45:00.400 --> 05:45:01.240
Good afternoon.

05:45:01.240 --> 05:45:03.240
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:45:03.240 --> 05:45:04.080
You have one minute.

05:45:04.080 --> 05:45:05.040
Your time starts now.

05:45:06.200 --> 05:45:09.280
I am Lucy Edwards from Napa County Office of Education,

05:45:09.280 --> 05:45:10.840
representing CESA

05:45:10.840 --> 05:45:13.560
and its Curriculum and Instruction Steering Committee.

05:45:13.560 --> 05:45:15.800
CISC submitted a detailed letter of feedback

05:45:15.800 --> 05:45:19.080
to the State Board of Education regarding this action item.

05:45:19.080 --> 05:45:21.560
CISC wants to acknowledge the efforts by CDE

05:45:21.560 --> 05:45:24.200
and various state agencies that went into the development

05:45:24.200 --> 05:45:25.720
of the state literacy plan.

05:45:25.760 --> 05:45:27.360
We believe the document is well-balanced

05:45:27.360 --> 05:45:29.040
regarding attention to English learners

05:45:29.040 --> 05:45:30.680
and students with disabilities.

05:45:30.680 --> 05:45:32.320
There are ample resources included

05:45:32.320 --> 05:45:34.000
for both these student groups.

05:45:34.000 --> 05:45:35.600
We recommend more guidance be added

05:45:35.600 --> 05:45:38.040
for supporting African-American students, though.

05:45:38.040 --> 05:45:40.160
This student group has some of the lowest performances

05:45:40.160 --> 05:45:41.760
across grade levels on the cap

05:45:41.760 --> 05:45:44.960
and yet have been largely excluded from the plan's narrative.

05:45:44.960 --> 05:45:46.840
In addition, as currently written,

05:45:46.840 --> 05:45:48.720
CISC believes that the state literacy plan

05:45:48.720 --> 05:45:51.320
raises the synopsis of the various state documents

05:45:51.320 --> 05:45:52.760
related to literacy.

05:45:52.760 --> 05:45:55.560
CISC is concerned that the document is not yet a model

05:45:55.560 --> 05:45:58.760
of an executable plan for school districts to follow.

05:45:58.760 --> 05:46:00.720
We have heard that a companion tool is being created

05:46:00.720 --> 05:46:02.720
to help districts develop their own plans.

05:46:02.720 --> 05:46:04.360
In the meantime, CISC recommends

05:46:04.360 --> 05:46:06.520
that the state literacy plan be renamed

05:46:06.520 --> 05:46:08.400
California State Literacy Initiatives,

05:46:08.400 --> 05:46:10.320
a Synopsis of Guiding Documents,

05:46:10.320 --> 05:46:12.240
to better reflect its current content.

05:46:12.240 --> 05:46:13.080
Thank you.

05:46:13.080 --> 05:46:13.900
Thank you.

05:46:16.520 --> 05:46:17.360
Good afternoon.

05:46:17.360 --> 05:46:19.160
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:46:19.160 --> 05:46:20.000
You have one minute.

05:46:20.000 --> 05:46:20.960
Your time starts now.

05:46:22.040 --> 05:46:24.840
I am Toby Meyer, and I have a son with dyslexia.

05:46:24.840 --> 05:46:26.800
My son would never have learned how to read

05:46:26.800 --> 05:46:29.440
without using a structured literacy approach.

05:46:29.440 --> 05:46:33.040
Structured literacy benefits all and is critical to some.

05:46:33.040 --> 05:46:35.520
Our school districts are begging for more information

05:46:35.520 --> 05:46:37.720
on how to incorporate structured literacy

05:46:37.720 --> 05:46:39.320
into the Gen Ed curriculum.

05:46:40.440 --> 05:46:43.040
Respondents to the statewide needs survey

05:46:43.040 --> 05:46:44.920
overwhelmingly stated their concerns

05:46:44.920 --> 05:46:47.680
about the lack of sustained quality professional learning

05:46:47.680 --> 05:46:50.160
to support students with disabilities.

05:46:50.160 --> 05:46:51.840
They noted that their current curriculum

05:46:51.840 --> 05:46:54.800
does not align with the California Dyslexia Guidelines

05:46:55.800 --> 05:46:57.560
and that the LEAs need more professional learning

05:46:57.560 --> 05:47:00.440
on the guidelines and the ELA ELD framework.

05:47:00.440 --> 05:47:02.920
Yet structured literacy is only mentioned once

05:47:02.920 --> 05:47:05.280
in the entire state literacy plan,

05:47:05.280 --> 05:47:08.560
and it refers readers back to the Dyslexia Guidelines.

05:47:08.560 --> 05:47:10.760
If the guidelines, which have been out for several years,

05:47:10.760 --> 05:47:12.400
have not provided the professional learning

05:47:12.400 --> 05:47:14.160
that the school districts so desperately need,

05:47:14.160 --> 05:47:16.000
merely cross-referencing them

05:47:16.000 --> 05:47:17.600
is not going to address this need.

05:47:17.600 --> 05:47:19.480
California's grant application stated

05:47:19.480 --> 05:47:20.640
that it would highlight

05:47:20.640 --> 05:47:22.840
comprehensive evidence-based strategies

05:47:22.840 --> 05:47:24.880
for improving literacy outcomes.

05:47:24.880 --> 05:47:27.680
The draft has written our kids down.

05:47:27.680 --> 05:47:28.520
Thank you.

05:47:28.520 --> 05:47:29.340
Thank you.

05:47:32.240 --> 05:47:33.080
Good afternoon.

05:47:33.080 --> 05:47:35.760
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:47:35.760 --> 05:47:36.600
You have one minute.

05:47:36.600 --> 05:47:37.680
Your time starts now.

05:47:38.960 --> 05:47:41.040
Hello, my name is Aleta Fisher.

05:47:41.040 --> 05:47:44.360
I am the advocacy chair

05:47:44.360 --> 05:47:46.640
for the San Francisco Unified School District

05:47:46.640 --> 05:47:50.080
Community Advisory Committee for Special Education.

05:47:50.080 --> 05:47:53.760
I have to say, thank you so much for all the work

05:47:53.760 --> 05:47:58.400
that's gone into everything that's happening here.

05:47:58.400 --> 05:48:00.760
And in particular, I'm excited to see

05:48:00.760 --> 05:48:02.600
the California Dyslexia Guidelines

05:48:02.600 --> 05:48:04.200
and California Practitioner's Guide

05:48:04.200 --> 05:48:07.240
for Educating ELLs with Disability referenced.

05:48:08.440 --> 05:48:10.280
But as mentioned by many previous callers,

05:48:10.280 --> 05:48:13.600
the reference isn't enough and doesn't go far enough.

05:48:13.600 --> 05:48:18.600
I am excited to see that best first instruction, MTSS,

05:48:20.160 --> 05:48:22.640
and UDL are all called out here.

05:48:22.640 --> 05:48:26.320
But as a parent of four students with disabilities

05:48:26.320 --> 05:48:28.360
and as a special education advocate,

05:48:28.360 --> 05:48:30.760
I unfortunately very often find myself

05:48:30.760 --> 05:48:32.920
in the unenviable situation

05:48:32.920 --> 05:48:36.860
of having to explain terms like structured literacy,

05:48:36.860 --> 05:48:41.860
UDL, MTSS to not only fellow parents,

05:48:41.860 --> 05:48:43.060
but teachers educated.

05:48:45.160 --> 05:48:47.640
We need to do better in integrating all this

05:48:47.640 --> 05:48:51.120
so everyone understands what we're talking about here.

05:48:52.040 --> 05:48:52.880
Thank you.

05:48:56.560 --> 05:48:57.880
Good afternoon, please state your name

05:48:57.880 --> 05:48:59.760
and affiliation for the record.

05:48:59.760 --> 05:49:01.960
You have one minute, your time starts now.

05:49:03.120 --> 05:49:06.120
Good afternoon, this is Sarah Lillis with Teach Plus.

05:49:06.120 --> 05:49:08.200
We appreciate the hard work that the staff

05:49:08.200 --> 05:49:10.320
and the state literacy team and IQC

05:49:10.320 --> 05:49:12.300
and everyone else put into drawing together

05:49:12.300 --> 05:49:14.620
the many pieces of this literacy plan.

05:49:14.620 --> 05:49:16.920
Our teacher leaders appreciate the opportunity to review

05:49:16.920 --> 05:49:18.640
and provide feedback during the process

05:49:18.640 --> 05:49:20.480
and the edits that have been made.

05:49:20.480 --> 05:49:21.800
We understand the purpose of this

05:49:21.800 --> 05:49:24.560
as a plan to align an existing initiative

05:49:24.560 --> 05:49:25.800
and it does a good job of that

05:49:25.800 --> 05:49:27.640
and it's an important first step.

05:49:27.640 --> 05:49:29.280
But as our teachers reviewed the plan

05:49:29.280 --> 05:49:31.920
and reflected on their own experiences in the classroom,

05:49:31.920 --> 05:49:34.720
they noted that it also helps highlight what's missing

05:49:34.720 --> 05:49:36.880
and where there may be need for state level change

05:49:36.880 --> 05:49:40.600
or investment to advance the vision of statewide literacy.

05:49:40.600 --> 05:49:43.240
Moving forward, we hope that elevating statewide needs

05:49:43.240 --> 05:49:44.600
be also be an explicit part

05:49:44.600 --> 05:49:46.540
of the continuous improvement process

05:49:47.140 --> 05:49:49.340
and impact of subsequent grants focus on that.

05:49:49.340 --> 05:49:51.660
One quick example, we appreciate the priority

05:49:51.660 --> 05:49:54.000
to build teacher capacity across disciplines

05:49:54.000 --> 05:49:55.700
for literacy instruction.

05:49:55.700 --> 05:49:57.700
But our teachers believe it's really important to do so

05:49:57.700 --> 05:50:00.620
but noted that some existing standards like CTE

05:50:00.620 --> 05:50:02.940
do not reflect that focus.

05:50:02.940 --> 05:50:04.980
We also really appreciate the priorities

05:50:04.980 --> 05:50:08.020
of building capacity for foundational skills

05:50:08.020 --> 05:50:10.140
and that's really where it's rubber hits the road

05:50:10.140 --> 05:50:12.880
and meets the road and we hope to be able to help figure out

05:50:12.880 --> 05:50:14.500
what that looks like, thank you.

05:50:14.500 --> 05:50:15.340
Thank you.

05:50:17.540 --> 05:50:19.540
Good afternoon, please state your name

05:50:19.540 --> 05:50:20.860
and affiliation for the record.

05:50:20.860 --> 05:50:22.940
You have one minute, your time starts now.

05:50:24.020 --> 05:50:26.780
My name is Megan Potente and I'm co-state director

05:50:26.780 --> 05:50:29.020
for Decoding Dyslexia California.

05:50:29.020 --> 05:50:33.220
DDCA has submitted specific written comments to the SBE

05:50:33.220 --> 05:50:35.820
but I will now speak to our larger concern.

05:50:35.820 --> 05:50:38.060
20 years of experience as an educator

05:50:38.060 --> 05:50:41.040
has taught me the importance of a coherent plan.

05:50:41.040 --> 05:50:43.240
School leaders deserve a literacy plan

05:50:43.240 --> 05:50:46.260
that defines clear steps toward implementation

05:50:46.980 --> 05:50:49.820
of evidence-based practices that will close opportunity gaps

05:50:49.820 --> 05:50:51.660
for disadvantaged students.

05:50:51.660 --> 05:50:54.540
This however is not the plan being put forth today

05:50:54.540 --> 05:50:58.520
which is more of a pile up of existing state guidance.

05:50:58.520 --> 05:51:01.460
The stated goal of the grant is to improve literacy outcomes

05:51:01.460 --> 05:51:04.900
for students who have been traditionally underserved,

05:51:04.900 --> 05:51:07.380
children living in poverty, English learners,

05:51:07.380 --> 05:51:09.460
children with disabilities and foster youth

05:51:09.460 --> 05:51:11.420
are supposed to be prioritized

05:51:11.420 --> 05:51:15.140
if the plan lacks the focus needed to spur improvement.

05:51:15.180 --> 05:51:18.260
Alignment and integration are cited as the goal

05:51:18.260 --> 05:51:21.500
yet the plan is a disjointed compilation of excerpts

05:51:21.500 --> 05:51:25.180
and references to approximately 30 different guidelines,

05:51:25.180 --> 05:51:27.180
policy documents and framework.

05:51:27.180 --> 05:51:28.500
Time.

05:51:28.500 --> 05:51:30.660
We can do better, thank you very much.

05:51:30.660 --> 05:51:31.500
Thank you.

05:51:34.040 --> 05:51:35.460
Good afternoon, please state your name

05:51:35.460 --> 05:51:37.180
and affiliation for the record.

05:51:37.180 --> 05:51:39.380
You have one minute, your time starts now.

05:51:40.460 --> 05:51:42.460
Yes, good afternoon, Leticia Garcia

05:51:42.460 --> 05:51:44.020
on behalf of the Riverside County

05:51:44.060 --> 05:51:46.140
Superintendent of Schools.

05:51:46.140 --> 05:51:48.580
We appreciate staff's work with stakeholders

05:51:48.580 --> 05:51:51.300
and field experts to develop the draft plan

05:51:51.300 --> 05:51:52.860
before you today.

05:51:52.860 --> 05:51:55.180
I may now for two suggestions.

05:51:55.180 --> 05:51:58.660
We ask that the final plan include additional information

05:51:58.660 --> 05:52:01.620
regarding the effective use of the TK

05:52:01.620 --> 05:52:04.300
to second grade reading assessments

05:52:04.300 --> 05:52:06.540
in order to monitor and ensure students

05:52:06.540 --> 05:52:09.900
are mastering standards in primary grades.

05:52:09.900 --> 05:52:13.460
This is critical for early prevention and intervention.

05:52:13.540 --> 05:52:17.180
We also ask that the final plan address all student groups

05:52:17.180 --> 05:52:19.500
that have been traditionally underserved

05:52:19.500 --> 05:52:22.180
per the data included on page 54.

05:52:22.180 --> 05:52:24.100
This is important not only to ensure

05:52:24.100 --> 05:52:25.940
for the success of all students,

05:52:25.940 --> 05:52:27.740
but also to better align the plan

05:52:27.740 --> 05:52:29.820
with the purpose of the grant.

05:52:29.820 --> 05:52:32.620
Again, thank you for the opportunity to comment.

05:52:32.620 --> 05:52:33.440
Thank you.

05:52:36.140 --> 05:52:37.380
Good afternoon, please state your name

05:52:37.380 --> 05:52:38.700
and affiliation for the record.

05:52:38.700 --> 05:52:40.860
You have one minute, your time starts now.

05:52:41.860 --> 05:52:44.500
Lexi Lopez on behalf of EdVoice.

05:52:44.500 --> 05:52:46.860
While we recognize the plan is intended to pull together

05:52:46.860 --> 05:52:48.740
and reference multiple source documents,

05:52:48.740 --> 05:52:50.900
standards, guidance, and frameworks,

05:52:50.900 --> 05:52:52.620
EdVoice urges the plan be amended

05:52:52.620 --> 05:52:55.420
to reference key findings from the science of reading.

05:52:55.420 --> 05:52:57.140
A comprehensive state literacy plan

05:52:57.140 --> 05:52:59.700
is precisely the document that should include

05:52:59.700 --> 05:53:01.980
the unambiguous evidence from science

05:53:01.980 --> 05:53:03.780
of what works in early reading.

05:53:03.780 --> 05:53:06.220
In doing so, the state can fulfill its grant commitment

05:53:06.220 --> 05:53:08.420
and more importantly, be sure California

05:53:08.420 --> 05:53:10.780
is supporting teachers as best we know how

05:53:11.700 --> 05:53:13.340
so that all students and student subgroups,

05:53:13.340 --> 05:53:15.380
including English learners and students screened

05:53:15.380 --> 05:53:18.260
as struggling, can achieve measurably better outcomes

05:53:18.260 --> 05:53:20.580
over the period of the grant and beyond.

05:53:20.580 --> 05:53:23.300
Specifically, when the plan references foundational skills

05:53:23.300 --> 05:53:25.980
and evidence-based instructional strategies,

05:53:25.980 --> 05:53:28.340
EdVoice urges the board to require the level of detail

05:53:28.340 --> 05:53:33.340
in subdivision B4 of section 44259 of the education code.

05:53:34.180 --> 05:53:36.340
We recommend amendments to the plan, the glossary,

05:53:36.340 --> 05:53:38.580
and background documentation on the website.

05:53:38.580 --> 05:53:39.540
The evidence is clear.

05:53:39.540 --> 05:53:40.940
Children can be taught to read well

05:53:40.940 --> 05:53:42.300
and we know California can do better

05:53:42.300 --> 05:53:44.020
in supporting these teachers.

05:53:44.020 --> 05:53:46.220
This will be a stronger plan with explicit reference

05:53:46.220 --> 05:53:48.420
to the scientific evidence of skills.

05:53:48.420 --> 05:53:49.240
Thank you.

05:53:49.240 --> 05:53:50.080
Thank you.

05:53:52.260 --> 05:53:53.500
Good afternoon, please state your name

05:53:53.500 --> 05:53:54.860
and affiliation for the record.

05:53:54.860 --> 05:53:56.980
You have one minute, your time starts now.

05:53:58.020 --> 05:54:00.700
My name's Carol Carolson and I am the parent

05:54:00.700 --> 05:54:02.980
of a child in special education.

05:54:04.020 --> 05:54:07.660
She struggles significantly with reading and writing

05:54:07.660 --> 05:54:10.340
and her team has no idea how to help her

05:54:10.340 --> 05:54:13.300
and has little understanding of the foundational skills

05:54:13.300 --> 05:54:16.100
and routinely minimizes them.

05:54:16.100 --> 05:54:18.460
This comprehensive state literacy plan

05:54:18.460 --> 05:54:21.060
does not provide clear guidance or direction

05:54:21.060 --> 05:54:25.060
to teachers or IEP teams and they cannot act on it.

05:54:25.060 --> 05:54:28.060
Schools need to develop much deeper understanding

05:54:28.060 --> 05:54:29.660
about how to serve readers,

05:54:29.660 --> 05:54:33.220
including universal screening, diagnostic testing,

05:54:33.220 --> 05:54:36.180
and how to use it to inform instruction.

05:54:37.060 --> 05:54:40.580
And this is for not only mono English students,

05:54:40.580 --> 05:54:41.460
it's all students.

05:54:41.460 --> 05:54:44.580
All students can suffer from these problems.

05:54:44.580 --> 05:54:47.740
Most of the guidance documents referenced in the plan

05:54:47.740 --> 05:54:51.340
minimize foundational skills and many educators

05:54:51.340 --> 05:54:54.620
I have encountered are almost hostile about them.

05:54:54.620 --> 05:54:57.220
For many students who struggle like my daughter,

05:54:57.220 --> 05:54:59.420
these skills are very critical.

05:54:59.420 --> 05:55:00.300
Thank you.

05:55:00.300 --> 05:55:01.140
Thank you.

05:55:03.780 --> 05:55:05.020
Good afternoon, please state your name

05:55:05.060 --> 05:55:06.420
and affiliation for the record.

05:55:06.420 --> 05:55:07.260
You have one minute.

05:55:07.260 --> 05:55:08.300
Your time starts now.

05:55:09.660 --> 05:55:12.500
Hi, Jessica Sacco on behalf of Children Now.

05:55:12.500 --> 05:55:15.380
I'd like to start by thanking Barbara Murchison

05:55:15.380 --> 05:55:17.900
and the state literacy team for all of their efforts

05:55:17.900 --> 05:55:20.260
to pull together this plan.

05:55:20.260 --> 05:55:23.700
It's clear a great deal of work went into this process.

05:55:23.700 --> 05:55:25.980
Their interest and openness

05:55:25.980 --> 05:55:28.660
to accepting stakeholder feedback

05:55:28.660 --> 05:55:31.100
and their efforts to try and bring together

05:55:31.100 --> 05:55:33.580
the broad variety of resources

05:55:33.580 --> 05:55:36.540
that the state has produced over the last few years

05:55:36.540 --> 05:55:40.060
to improve and promote literacy.

05:55:40.060 --> 05:55:42.580
That being said, we still do have some concerns

05:55:42.580 --> 05:55:45.700
around the focus on foundational skills

05:55:45.700 --> 05:55:46.900
as outlined in the plan,

05:55:46.900 --> 05:55:50.060
particularly the impact that that focus could have

05:55:50.060 --> 05:55:52.020
on our English learners.

05:55:52.020 --> 05:55:54.620
And we will hope you will consider the feedback

05:55:54.620 --> 05:55:57.260
that you received today in regards to that matter.

05:55:57.260 --> 05:55:58.100
Thank you.

05:55:58.100 --> 05:55:58.920
Thank you.

05:56:01.220 --> 05:56:02.380
Good afternoon, please state your name

05:56:02.420 --> 05:56:03.620
and affiliation for the record.

05:56:03.620 --> 05:56:04.460
You have one minute.

05:56:04.460 --> 05:56:05.540
Your time starts now.

05:56:06.980 --> 05:56:07.820
Good afternoon.

05:56:07.820 --> 05:56:08.660
This is Lisa Moscow

05:56:08.660 --> 05:56:10.780
and I'm calling on behalf of Speak Up.

05:56:10.780 --> 05:56:12.140
In the comprehensive literary

05:56:12.140 --> 05:56:14.580
state development grant application,

05:56:14.580 --> 05:56:16.620
there's no highlighting of comprehensive guidance

05:56:16.620 --> 05:56:18.740
based on the science of reading.

05:56:18.740 --> 05:56:20.500
In the RECA content specifications,

05:56:20.500 --> 05:56:21.420
which carefully detailed

05:56:21.420 --> 05:56:24.460
foundational reading instruction skills for teachers.

05:56:24.460 --> 05:56:27.420
It was specifically tatted in this application,

05:56:27.420 --> 05:56:29.060
but zero references made to RECA

05:56:29.060 --> 05:56:30.980
in the state literacy plan.

05:56:31.060 --> 05:56:33.580
I urge the board to develop a coherent vision

05:56:33.580 --> 05:56:35.100
that aligns resources and guidance

05:56:35.100 --> 05:56:37.580
instead of cross referencing thousands of pages

05:56:37.580 --> 05:56:40.100
of underlying guidelines and policies.

05:56:40.100 --> 05:56:43.140
LEAs need clear guidance to inform their approaches

05:56:43.140 --> 05:56:45.980
so they can choose the evidence based practices.

05:56:45.980 --> 05:56:48.140
Most of all, we need underserved kids,

05:56:48.140 --> 05:56:50.660
English learners, standard English learners,

05:56:50.660 --> 05:56:53.180
foster youth and students with disabilities

05:56:53.180 --> 05:56:55.140
to be able to access a comprehensive

05:56:55.140 --> 05:56:57.340
science of reading based plan

05:56:57.340 --> 05:57:00.540
that offers them access to literacy across the board.

05:57:00.540 --> 05:57:01.460
Thank you.

05:57:01.460 --> 05:57:02.300
Thank you.

05:57:05.140 --> 05:57:05.980
Good afternoon.

05:57:05.980 --> 05:57:08.220
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:57:08.220 --> 05:57:09.060
You have one minute.

05:57:09.060 --> 05:57:10.100
Your time starts now.

05:57:11.220 --> 05:57:13.140
Yes, this is Dr. Katherine Christo,

05:57:13.140 --> 05:57:15.660
professor emeritus at California State University,

05:57:15.660 --> 05:57:19.780
Sacramento, and I wish to address teacher preparation.

05:57:19.780 --> 05:57:21.380
In its grant application,

05:57:21.380 --> 05:57:25.020
CDE states that the commission on teacher credentialing

05:57:25.020 --> 05:57:27.820
works to ensure that pre-service candidates

05:57:27.820 --> 05:57:29.420
have the knowledge and skills

05:57:29.460 --> 05:57:32.700
to provide reading instruction and literacy development.

05:57:32.700 --> 05:57:35.860
The grant application specifically cited as a strength

05:57:35.860 --> 05:57:39.100
and as reason for federal grant consideration

05:57:39.100 --> 05:57:41.260
that teacher preparation programs

05:57:41.260 --> 05:57:43.940
are required to align their coursework

05:57:43.940 --> 05:57:46.700
with the reading instruction competence assessment

05:57:46.700 --> 05:57:49.620
or RECA content specification.

05:57:49.620 --> 05:57:53.100
However, the draft California State Literacy Plan

05:57:53.100 --> 05:57:56.780
is silent as to RECA content specifications.

05:57:56.780 --> 05:58:01.140
The RECA content specifications contain critical information

05:58:01.140 --> 05:58:02.620
regarding evidence-based

05:58:02.620 --> 05:58:05.340
foundational reading instruction standards

05:58:05.340 --> 05:58:07.300
or teacher preparation program

05:58:07.300 --> 05:58:10.540
and need to be at minimum cross-referenced

05:58:10.540 --> 05:58:14.660
as a resource in teacher preparation in the CSLP.

05:58:14.660 --> 05:58:15.500
Time.

05:58:15.500 --> 05:58:18.220
Adherence to these content specifications

05:58:18.220 --> 05:58:20.940
will help ensure that our teachers know critical information

05:58:20.940 --> 05:58:22.780
regarding the science of reading.

05:58:22.780 --> 05:58:23.900
Thank you very much.

05:58:23.900 --> 05:58:24.740
Thank you.

05:58:27.580 --> 05:58:28.420
Good afternoon.

05:58:28.420 --> 05:58:30.420
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:58:30.420 --> 05:58:31.260
You have one minute.

05:58:31.260 --> 05:58:32.380
Your time starts now.

05:58:43.620 --> 05:58:44.460
Good afternoon.

05:58:44.460 --> 05:58:46.700
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:58:46.700 --> 05:58:47.540
You have one minute.

05:58:47.540 --> 05:58:48.660
Your time starts now.

05:58:50.020 --> 05:58:51.300
Hi, this is Robert Mullinger

05:58:51.300 --> 05:58:54.180
and I'm a parent in the Mountain View Richmond School District.

05:58:54.180 --> 05:58:56.020
The federal grant requires California

05:58:56.020 --> 05:58:57.460
to advance literacy skills

05:58:57.460 --> 05:58:59.660
through the use of evidence-based practices,

05:58:59.660 --> 05:59:01.580
activities, and interventions,

05:59:01.580 --> 05:59:04.180
including pre-literacy skills reading and writing

05:59:04.180 --> 05:59:06.700
for children from birth through grade 12,

05:59:06.700 --> 05:59:09.140
with an emphasis on disadvantaged children,

05:59:09.140 --> 05:59:12.460
including children living in poverty, English learners,

05:59:12.460 --> 05:59:14.220
and children with disabilities.

05:59:14.220 --> 05:59:16.740
Yet, in the state literacy plans,

05:59:16.740 --> 05:59:19.380
literacy priorities for grades six through 12,

05:59:19.380 --> 05:59:22.940
dyslexia, which is the single largest learning disability

05:59:22.940 --> 05:59:25.980
and affects up to 20% of California students,

05:59:26.980 --> 05:59:28.060
is not mentioned,

05:59:28.060 --> 05:59:30.900
nor are the California dyslexia guidelines referenced

05:59:30.900 --> 05:59:33.540
under the supporting students with disabilities

05:59:33.540 --> 05:59:35.260
in grades six through 12.

05:59:35.260 --> 05:59:36.220
Thank you.

05:59:36.220 --> 05:59:37.060
Thank you.

05:59:39.820 --> 05:59:40.660
Good afternoon.

05:59:40.660 --> 05:59:42.860
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:59:42.860 --> 05:59:43.700
You have one minute.

05:59:43.700 --> 05:59:44.700
Your time starts now.

05:59:46.180 --> 05:59:48.260
My name is Gwenda Carvalho-Sell.

05:59:48.260 --> 05:59:50.500
I am a parent of a struggling reader,

05:59:50.500 --> 05:59:52.220
but one who has greatly benefited

05:59:52.220 --> 05:59:54.860
from structured literacy methodology.

05:59:54.900 --> 05:59:57.300
I believe they work because I've seen them work.

05:59:57.300 --> 05:59:59.020
My daughter can read.

05:59:59.020 --> 06:00:01.060
This comprehensive state literacy plan

06:00:01.060 --> 06:00:03.660
does not provide clear guidance or direction

06:00:03.660 --> 06:00:06.620
that her teachers would be able to follow to help her.

06:00:06.620 --> 06:00:08.020
I have found that most teachers

06:00:08.020 --> 06:00:10.340
do not have a solid understanding

06:00:10.340 --> 06:00:12.980
of how to teach foundational reading skills,

06:00:12.980 --> 06:00:15.700
even when students are identified for intervention

06:00:15.700 --> 06:00:17.420
or resource services.

06:00:17.420 --> 06:00:19.700
I know there is more to reading than decoding,

06:00:19.700 --> 06:00:21.260
but if a child cannot decode,

06:00:21.260 --> 06:00:23.540
they will continue to struggle with reading.

06:00:23.540 --> 06:00:26.820
I thank everyone for their efforts on this project.

06:00:26.820 --> 06:00:27.660
Thank you.

06:00:30.340 --> 06:00:31.180
Good afternoon.

06:00:31.180 --> 06:00:32.900
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:00:32.900 --> 06:00:33.740
You have one minute.

06:00:33.740 --> 06:00:34.820
Your time starts now.

06:00:36.100 --> 06:00:37.620
My name is Ronit Glickman,

06:00:37.620 --> 06:00:39.180
and I'm a public school teacher

06:00:39.180 --> 06:00:40.820
with the Santa Rosa City Schools,

06:00:40.820 --> 06:00:44.220
and I'm also the mother of a student with dyslexia,

06:00:44.220 --> 06:00:46.340
and my daughter would not be able to read

06:00:46.340 --> 06:00:49.740
without her tutor who is trained in the science of reading.

06:00:49.740 --> 06:00:52.020
I spent my own money and my own time

06:00:52.020 --> 06:00:53.700
to get additional professional development

06:00:53.700 --> 06:00:56.540
and training in multisensory structured literacy.

06:00:56.540 --> 06:00:59.180
It is powerful and it is empowering to know

06:00:59.180 --> 06:01:00.860
that I can support all my students

06:01:00.860 --> 06:01:03.500
as well as students with learning disabilities.

06:01:03.500 --> 06:01:06.220
This current draft plan does not provide the guidance

06:01:06.220 --> 06:01:08.020
aligned with the science of reading,

06:01:08.020 --> 06:01:10.180
and it does not help our school leaders

06:01:10.180 --> 06:01:13.700
implement evidence-based reading and writing instruction.

06:01:13.700 --> 06:01:16.100
In a recent publication from the University of California,

06:01:16.100 --> 06:01:18.060
San Francisco Dyslexia Center,

06:01:18.060 --> 06:01:22.100
it said investing in early screening and teacher training

06:01:22.100 --> 06:01:26.060
would provide an astonishing 800 to 2,000% return.

06:01:26.060 --> 06:01:28.140
There needs to be a strong emphasis

06:01:28.140 --> 06:01:30.220
on early universal screening for children

06:01:30.220 --> 06:01:31.860
at risk of reading failure,

06:01:31.860 --> 06:01:35.860
as well as provide structured literacy across all tiers.

06:01:35.860 --> 06:01:38.100
Every teacher deserves to know the science of reading,

06:01:38.100 --> 06:01:41.060
and every child is a teacher who knows it.

06:01:41.060 --> 06:01:42.660
Thank you for your work and time.

06:01:42.660 --> 06:01:43.500
Thank you.

06:01:43.500 --> 06:01:44.340
Good afternoon.

06:01:44.340 --> 06:01:45.180
Please state your name and affiliation.

06:01:45.180 --> 06:01:46.020
Good afternoon.

06:01:46.020 --> 06:01:47.180
Alexis Zaragoza-Diaz,

06:01:47.180 --> 06:01:49.100
representing the California Association

06:01:49.100 --> 06:01:52.100
for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

06:01:52.100 --> 06:01:54.260
The Foundational Reading Skills Approach

06:01:54.260 --> 06:01:56.900
to Literacy Development limit and minimize

06:01:56.900 --> 06:01:59.140
the full literacy and biliteracy development

06:01:59.140 --> 06:02:00.580
for English learners.

06:02:00.580 --> 06:02:03.900
The California Common Core Standards for ELA and ELD

06:02:03.900 --> 06:02:05.900
calls for a curriculum that reflects

06:02:05.900 --> 06:02:07.780
an integrated model of literacy,

06:02:07.780 --> 06:02:09.780
not just foundational skills,

06:02:09.780 --> 06:02:11.500
one in which the students can learn

06:02:11.660 --> 06:02:12.940
foundational skills,

06:02:12.940 --> 06:02:15.900
one in which the integrated communication processes

06:02:15.900 --> 06:02:18.100
of reading, writing, speaking, listening,

06:02:18.100 --> 06:02:20.380
and language development are closely connected

06:02:20.380 --> 06:02:22.900
and support the development of one another.

06:02:22.900 --> 06:02:24.900
We must go beyond foundational skills

06:02:24.900 --> 06:02:26.980
for our English learners

06:02:26.980 --> 06:02:29.180
by including all five literacy themes

06:02:29.180 --> 06:02:31.980
as identified in the ELA, ELD framework

06:02:31.980 --> 06:02:34.860
in order to provide English learner students

06:02:34.860 --> 06:02:37.580
a rich, robust, and comprehensive learning approach

06:02:38.060 --> 06:02:41.740
for true literacy and biliteracy success

06:02:41.740 --> 06:02:44.060
from TK through 12th grade.

06:02:44.060 --> 06:02:45.020
Thank you.

06:02:45.020 --> 06:02:45.860
Thank you.

06:02:48.700 --> 06:02:49.540
Good afternoon.

06:02:49.540 --> 06:02:51.220
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:02:51.220 --> 06:02:52.060
You have one minute.

06:02:52.060 --> 06:02:53.060
Your time starts now.

06:02:54.300 --> 06:02:55.620
My name is Nancy Rudding,

06:02:55.620 --> 06:02:58.540
and I am a teacher trainer of structured literacy

06:02:58.540 --> 06:03:00.180
throughout the state of California.

06:03:00.180 --> 06:03:02.500
I have spent 40 years teaching

06:03:02.500 --> 06:03:04.540
and trying to help teachers

06:03:05.500 --> 06:03:08.740
gain access to the structure,

06:03:08.740 --> 06:03:10.700
the science of reading.

06:03:10.700 --> 06:03:14.180
The reality is that according to the 2019

06:03:14.180 --> 06:03:15.620
nation's report card,

06:03:15.620 --> 06:03:19.020
37% of fourth graders in the state of California

06:03:19.020 --> 06:03:21.500
are reading at a level below basic.

06:03:21.500 --> 06:03:23.580
This is not acceptable.

06:03:23.580 --> 06:03:26.380
I do not feel the state literacy plan

06:03:26.380 --> 06:03:29.180
addresses foundational skills for the state.

06:03:30.140 --> 06:03:32.540
I am all in favor of good literature.

06:03:32.540 --> 06:03:35.020
I am all in favor of oral language.

06:03:35.020 --> 06:03:36.860
Everything has to be included.

06:03:36.860 --> 06:03:38.260
I totally agree,

06:03:38.260 --> 06:03:41.900
but we cannot turn our backs on the kids,

06:03:41.900 --> 06:03:46.140
whether they're ELL kids, English language learners,

06:03:46.140 --> 06:03:47.180
struggling readers,

06:03:47.180 --> 06:03:50.860
or kids that come from a low language background.

06:03:50.860 --> 06:03:51.940
Thank you very much.

06:03:51.940 --> 06:03:52.780
Thank you.

06:03:55.180 --> 06:03:56.020
Good afternoon.

06:03:56.020 --> 06:03:57.660
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:03:57.660 --> 06:03:58.820
Your time starts now.

06:04:00.340 --> 06:04:01.900
Hello, my name is Dr. Marlene Batisan.

06:04:01.900 --> 06:04:04.820
I'm the Director of State and Legislative Affairs for CABE.

06:04:04.820 --> 06:04:06.220
We're concerned about the requirement

06:04:06.220 --> 06:04:08.380
to administer universal screening for dyslexia

06:04:08.380 --> 06:04:10.140
to all kindergarten students.

06:04:10.140 --> 06:04:11.860
There's already a trend of over-identifying

06:04:11.860 --> 06:04:14.140
our English learner students as special education students,

06:04:14.140 --> 06:04:17.260
and if we begin to assess students prior to an opportunity

06:04:17.260 --> 06:04:18.540
to participate in instruction,

06:04:18.540 --> 06:04:20.060
we will continue to expand on this trend.

06:04:20.060 --> 06:04:21.900
Therefore, it should not be considered

06:04:21.900 --> 06:04:23.020
a full battery of assessments

06:04:23.020 --> 06:04:24.940
and should absolutely take place after instruction

06:04:24.940 --> 06:04:28.020
has begun on the later part of the kindergarten year.

06:04:28.020 --> 06:04:29.940
Additionally, screening must be strategic and efficient

06:04:29.940 --> 06:04:31.500
and part of an instructional program

06:04:32.100 --> 06:04:33.580
aimed at promoting literacy growth and development.

06:04:33.580 --> 06:04:35.900
As part of that, teachers need to be on the lookout

06:04:35.900 --> 06:04:37.300
for signs of a possible disability

06:04:37.300 --> 06:04:39.900
and have input as to students who may need to be screened

06:04:39.900 --> 06:04:41.860
versus students who are English learners.

06:04:41.860 --> 06:04:42.980
Prior to making a decision on this,

06:04:42.980 --> 06:04:44.340
much more discussion needs to occur

06:04:44.340 --> 06:04:45.420
as to for which students

06:04:45.420 --> 06:04:47.580
and for which age the screening is appropriate,

06:04:47.580 --> 06:04:49.100
and definitely that it should not be given

06:04:49.100 --> 06:04:51.220
until late kindergarten at earliest.

06:04:51.220 --> 06:04:52.420
Thank you very much.

06:04:52.420 --> 06:04:53.260
Thank you.

06:04:55.300 --> 06:04:56.140
Good afternoon.

06:04:56.140 --> 06:04:57.660
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:04:57.660 --> 06:04:58.500
You have one minute.

06:04:58.500 --> 06:04:59.380
Your time starts now.

06:05:00.380 --> 06:05:02.660
Hello, my name is Jennifer Reynoso.

06:05:02.660 --> 06:05:05.260
I'm a parent of a special education student

06:05:05.260 --> 06:05:06.940
in Burbank, California.

06:05:06.940 --> 06:05:09.620
I would like to give feedback on item number six,

06:05:09.620 --> 06:05:13.620
the SLP draft fails to show meaningful support for students.

06:05:13.620 --> 06:05:15.900
School needs evidence-based reading

06:05:15.900 --> 06:05:19.580
and writing instructions, examples, the science of reading

06:05:19.580 --> 06:05:23.020
that adheres to the California guidelines of dyslexia.

06:05:23.020 --> 06:05:24.900
It is also critical that schools

06:05:24.900 --> 06:05:26.940
have early identification screening,

06:05:26.980 --> 06:05:29.780
universal screening in all schools.

06:05:29.780 --> 06:05:32.860
Schools also need support implementing these guidelines

06:05:32.860 --> 06:05:35.580
along with teacher and staff training.

06:05:35.580 --> 06:05:36.620
Thank you.

06:05:36.620 --> 06:05:37.460
Thank you.

06:05:39.660 --> 06:05:40.500
Good afternoon.

06:05:40.500 --> 06:05:42.220
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:05:42.220 --> 06:05:43.060
You have one minute.

06:05:43.060 --> 06:05:44.060
Your time starts now.

06:05:45.340 --> 06:05:47.060
Hi, my name is Christy Dennis.

06:05:47.060 --> 06:05:49.260
I am the parent of two students

06:05:49.260 --> 06:05:52.220
in the Pasadena Unified School District.

06:05:52.220 --> 06:05:54.420
They are both English language learners.

06:05:55.060 --> 06:05:57.940
I first just want to respond to the comment

06:05:57.940 --> 06:06:01.500
that just preceded the last one about screening for dyslexia.

06:06:01.500 --> 06:06:03.180
Both of my children have dyslexia

06:06:03.180 --> 06:06:04.980
and both of them are English language learners

06:06:04.980 --> 06:06:06.780
and there is absolutely no reason

06:06:06.780 --> 06:06:10.380
why a screening for dyslexia would in any way

06:06:10.380 --> 06:06:13.620
negatively impact English language learners.

06:06:13.620 --> 06:06:16.500
If only my children had been identified earlier,

06:06:16.500 --> 06:06:19.980
so much heartache and education loss could have been avoided.

06:06:21.340 --> 06:06:23.660
I look at the NAEP reading scores

06:06:23.700 --> 06:06:25.020
for the state of California

06:06:25.020 --> 06:06:29.340
and more than half of our students are basic

06:06:29.340 --> 06:06:32.540
or below basic, so clearly what we have been doing

06:06:32.540 --> 06:06:36.780
is not working and I just cannot understand

06:06:36.780 --> 06:06:38.980
why our legislators don't have the courage

06:06:38.980 --> 06:06:40.340
to try a different approach,

06:06:40.340 --> 06:06:43.820
particularly when we have decades upon decades of research

06:06:43.820 --> 06:06:46.260
about how to teach children to read.

06:06:46.260 --> 06:06:49.620
It works for children across the spectrum

06:06:49.620 --> 06:06:50.900
and it's very simple.

06:06:50.900 --> 06:06:51.740
Thank you.

06:06:51.740 --> 06:06:52.560
Thank you.

06:06:54.660 --> 06:06:55.820
Good afternoon.

06:06:55.820 --> 06:06:57.940
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:06:57.940 --> 06:06:58.780
You have one minute.

06:06:58.780 --> 06:06:59.900
Your time starts now.

06:07:01.100 --> 06:07:02.820
Hello, my name is Rachel Hurt

06:07:02.820 --> 06:07:04.020
and I'm a school board member

06:07:04.020 --> 06:07:06.020
in a mid-sized unified school district

06:07:06.020 --> 06:07:07.900
in the California East Bay.

06:07:07.900 --> 06:07:10.660
The ELA frameworks and many of the guidance documents

06:07:10.660 --> 06:07:14.540
compiled in this document seem to minimize

06:07:14.540 --> 06:07:16.620
or bury the foundational skills

06:07:16.620 --> 06:07:19.580
and the concerns expressed by some of the commenters

06:07:19.580 --> 06:07:21.780
before me about foundational skills

06:07:21.780 --> 06:07:25.140
and universal screening reveal how desperately

06:07:25.140 --> 06:07:27.580
guidance and alignment is needed.

06:07:27.580 --> 06:07:31.140
I really hate to see the state waste this opportunity

06:07:31.140 --> 06:07:35.740
to finally create an overall comprehensive literacy plan

06:07:35.740 --> 06:07:37.780
that addresses all of these factions

06:07:37.780 --> 06:07:39.700
and puts the reading awards to bed.

06:07:39.700 --> 06:07:40.540
Thank you.

06:07:40.540 --> 06:07:41.360
Thank you.

06:07:43.740 --> 06:07:44.580
Good afternoon.

06:07:44.580 --> 06:07:46.620
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:07:46.620 --> 06:07:47.460
You have one minute.

06:07:47.460 --> 06:07:48.380
Your time starts now.

06:07:49.380 --> 06:07:53.060
Diana Weir, reading specialist and consultant.

06:07:53.060 --> 06:07:55.700
The most fundamental responsibility of a school

06:07:55.700 --> 06:07:57.900
is to teach children to read.

06:07:57.900 --> 06:08:00.740
My concern is that without explicit details

06:08:00.740 --> 06:08:02.740
of how to support educators,

06:08:02.740 --> 06:08:04.340
our grant money will be spent

06:08:04.340 --> 06:08:07.220
on misguided assessment and instruction

06:08:07.220 --> 06:08:09.420
and the needs of our struggling readers,

06:08:09.420 --> 06:08:10.620
second language learners,

06:08:10.620 --> 06:08:14.020
and children of color and poverty will not be met.

06:08:14.020 --> 06:08:16.940
I am asking the team to establish criteria norms

06:08:17.020 --> 06:08:18.940
in three core areas,

06:08:18.940 --> 06:08:21.700
teacher knowledge, universal assessments,

06:08:21.700 --> 06:08:24.220
and effective instructional materials.

06:08:24.220 --> 06:08:26.140
In the area of teacher knowledge,

06:08:26.140 --> 06:08:27.540
use the standards provided

06:08:27.540 --> 06:08:30.300
by the International Dyslexia Association

06:08:30.300 --> 06:08:33.700
to evaluate and provide professional opportunities.

06:08:33.700 --> 06:08:37.460
Secondly, establish reliable universal statewide assessments

06:08:37.460 --> 06:08:39.900
that identify students at risk.

06:08:39.900 --> 06:08:42.060
This consistency within our large state

06:08:42.060 --> 06:08:45.220
is a necessity when providing systematic instruction

06:08:45.220 --> 06:08:47.620
for transient children.

06:08:47.620 --> 06:08:51.020
Thirdly, follow the lead of Colorado and Arkansas

06:08:51.020 --> 06:08:52.860
in providing districts with a list

06:08:52.860 --> 06:08:54.660
of approved reading programs

06:08:54.660 --> 06:08:56.460
that have passed a rigorous review.

06:08:56.460 --> 06:08:57.300
Thank you.

06:08:57.300 --> 06:08:58.940
Thank you.

06:08:58.940 --> 06:09:02.060
That concludes public comment for item number six.

06:09:04.500 --> 06:09:06.020
Thank you very much.

06:09:06.020 --> 06:09:07.980
Let me make sure I'm not on mute.

06:09:09.140 --> 06:09:11.060
Appreciate all of the public comment

06:09:11.980 --> 06:09:16.980
and we're now ready to engage in discussion with the Board.

06:09:20.340 --> 06:09:23.860
Are there comments or questions from Board members?

06:09:23.860 --> 06:09:27.180
And remember, this is not an item for action,

06:09:27.180 --> 06:09:29.540
it's an item for information.

06:09:30.420 --> 06:09:31.260
Member Rucker.

06:09:32.460 --> 06:09:34.020
Thank you.

06:09:34.020 --> 06:09:36.660
First of all, I wanted to make sure I said

06:09:36.660 --> 06:09:39.900
and acknowledged all of the people and stakeholders

06:09:39.900 --> 06:09:44.900
who took the time to call in for today's public comment

06:09:45.380 --> 06:09:47.180
in discussion of this item.

06:09:47.180 --> 06:09:49.340
I recognize that when you only have one minute,

06:09:49.340 --> 06:09:52.020
it's frustrating to feel whether or not

06:09:52.020 --> 06:09:55.300
you're making an impact in giving your feedback

06:09:55.300 --> 06:09:56.540
and your opinion.

06:09:56.540 --> 06:10:00.980
You were heard, but I can tell you that we pay attention

06:10:00.980 --> 06:10:04.100
and listen very closely to the concerns.

06:10:04.100 --> 06:10:08.100
I agree that we have this draft document

06:10:08.100 --> 06:10:11.700
has come a long way since we started the drafting

06:10:11.700 --> 06:10:15.500
and the teams have worked very, very well together.

06:10:15.500 --> 06:10:18.620
What I heard from the stakeholders

06:10:18.620 --> 06:10:20.980
falls into multiple buckets.

06:10:20.980 --> 06:10:24.940
I think it's probably a good idea to take a look at

06:10:24.940 --> 06:10:29.180
what is the difference in creating a state level plan

06:10:29.180 --> 06:10:34.060
and the work that was clearly laid out by department staff

06:10:34.060 --> 06:10:37.500
in doing the implementation and additional planning

06:10:37.660 --> 06:10:41.380
and work that would be done among the agencies

06:10:41.380 --> 06:10:45.060
that would be funded to implement this literacy plan

06:10:45.060 --> 06:10:48.260
in working with the LEAs they will work with.

06:10:48.260 --> 06:10:51.140
I think in the feedback I heard,

06:10:51.140 --> 06:10:55.900
there's a difference between some very explicit concerns

06:10:55.900 --> 06:10:59.060
about how the plan should be implemented

06:10:59.060 --> 06:11:04.060
and what the plan should direct or mandate that LEAs do.

06:11:04.060 --> 06:11:07.500
And so that falls into a couple of different buckets.

06:11:08.420 --> 06:11:11.020
Our goal is to make sure at this level,

06:11:11.020 --> 06:11:15.260
I feel that the plan clearly outlines the intent,

06:11:15.260 --> 06:11:18.500
the purpose, the functions, and most importantly,

06:11:18.500 --> 06:11:23.500
the overall outcomes for the funded LEAs and entities

06:11:23.660 --> 06:11:26.340
that will be working to implement the plan.

06:11:26.340 --> 06:11:30.740
The level of specificity about reading science

06:11:30.740 --> 06:11:32.500
and about instruction,

06:11:32.500 --> 06:11:36.620
that becomes more of a more granular discussion

06:11:36.620 --> 06:11:39.660
among those entities that will actually be doing

06:11:39.660 --> 06:11:40.900
this literacy work.

06:11:40.900 --> 06:11:45.460
And how much work we do to amend the plan further

06:11:45.460 --> 06:11:47.340
really comes down to A,

06:11:47.340 --> 06:11:50.020
how many masters do you want to serve?

06:11:50.020 --> 06:11:55.020
And really how much more content

06:11:55.020 --> 06:11:57.340
do you want to add that will make,

06:11:57.340 --> 06:12:00.100
that will increase the complexity of the plan

06:12:00.140 --> 06:12:02.500
without actually getting to the meat

06:12:02.500 --> 06:12:04.540
of what it is we're trying to do

06:12:04.540 --> 06:12:07.540
with create this literacy plan.

06:12:07.540 --> 06:12:11.660
I do agree that there's a concern about who is named

06:12:11.660 --> 06:12:14.740
or identified as the students in this plan.

06:12:14.740 --> 06:12:16.780
That's the reason why my favorite fairy tale

06:12:16.780 --> 06:12:18.220
is Sleeping Beauty.

06:12:18.220 --> 06:12:20.300
While there is this great attention

06:12:20.300 --> 06:12:23.060
or this great desire to name the all

06:12:23.060 --> 06:12:25.740
and to identify every single person

06:12:25.740 --> 06:12:28.260
and every single student that should be involved

06:12:28.260 --> 06:12:29.860
and served by the plan,

06:12:30.620 --> 06:12:32.740
I think the plan's goals clearly state

06:12:32.740 --> 06:12:34.900
that you're going to serve as a priority

06:12:34.900 --> 06:12:37.100
the students who are underperforming.

06:12:37.100 --> 06:12:39.620
And while I personally was concerned

06:12:39.620 --> 06:12:40.660
that students of color,

06:12:40.660 --> 06:12:42.260
particularly African-American students

06:12:42.260 --> 06:12:45.700
were not named as explicitly in the plan

06:12:45.700 --> 06:12:47.620
as English learners,

06:12:47.620 --> 06:12:51.860
I am clear that there is a clear expectation

06:12:51.860 --> 06:12:55.140
that the LEAs that will participate in this project

06:12:55.140 --> 06:12:57.540
must serve English learners.

06:12:57.540 --> 06:13:02.300
So I think that there is a way to address the concerns

06:13:02.300 --> 06:13:04.860
that have been raised by stakeholders

06:13:04.860 --> 06:13:08.100
about how do you balance the desire

06:13:08.100 --> 06:13:11.100
to see some very explicit specificity

06:13:11.100 --> 06:13:13.980
and granularity about what the plan should do,

06:13:13.980 --> 06:13:15.980
what teachers should be learning,

06:13:15.980 --> 06:13:20.100
as well as meeting the purposes of the overall arc

06:13:20.100 --> 06:13:23.300
of what this plan is to do to implement the grant.

06:13:24.180 --> 06:13:27.780
And I think that the staff have heard some feedback

06:13:27.780 --> 06:13:29.580
and ways to address it.

06:13:29.580 --> 06:13:32.940
I would caution against doing a drill down

06:13:32.940 --> 06:13:35.860
to create directives that already fall

06:13:35.860 --> 06:13:37.740
under legislative mandate

06:13:37.740 --> 06:13:40.380
or already fall under clear intent

06:13:40.380 --> 06:13:42.740
of the implementation of the plan,

06:13:42.740 --> 06:13:46.700
but to make sure that LEAs are in some ways

06:13:46.700 --> 06:13:48.900
and explicitly accountable.

06:13:48.900 --> 06:13:51.900
So my one piece of feedback is,

06:13:51.900 --> 06:13:54.660
and what I was hoping to see in the plan is

06:13:54.660 --> 06:13:59.660
not the specificity that may be getting called for here,

06:13:59.780 --> 06:14:04.540
but a clear outline of how the LEAs that are funded

06:14:04.540 --> 06:14:07.380
and participating will be held accountable.

06:14:07.380 --> 06:14:10.500
That goes back to what Dr. Darling-Hammond said

06:14:10.500 --> 06:14:12.260
at the beginning of the day.

06:14:12.260 --> 06:14:16.820
We need to take a look at how we are implementing programs

06:14:16.820 --> 06:14:19.660
from the state and into LEAs

06:14:19.660 --> 06:14:23.660
in ways that hold LEAs accountable for outcomes.

06:14:23.660 --> 06:14:24.860
It's not enough to say

06:14:24.860 --> 06:14:26.620
we're gonna raise student achievement.

06:14:26.620 --> 06:14:28.980
We really have to address disparities.

06:14:28.980 --> 06:14:31.340
And this plan and this literacy grant

06:14:31.340 --> 06:14:33.900
is a perfect example of a program

06:14:33.900 --> 06:14:36.420
that's intended to address disparities.

06:14:36.420 --> 06:14:38.380
But what I find is missing

06:14:38.380 --> 06:14:41.420
and that may actually satisfy some of the concerns

06:14:41.420 --> 06:14:43.380
being raised by stakeholders,

06:14:43.380 --> 06:14:48.060
is how are you going to expect the participating LEAs

06:14:48.060 --> 06:14:51.900
to be accountable for the outcomes and what they report?

06:14:51.900 --> 06:14:54.260
It will not be enough to just simply report

06:14:54.260 --> 06:14:56.700
whether student achievement was improved,

06:14:56.700 --> 06:15:00.180
but whether or not they actually address the disparities

06:15:00.180 --> 06:15:02.060
in the quality of instruction,

06:15:02.060 --> 06:15:03.940
the quality of professional learning

06:15:03.940 --> 06:15:07.700
afforded to the educators who will be doing this program,

06:15:07.700 --> 06:15:10.540
and whether or not there was actually an improvement

06:15:10.540 --> 06:15:14.660
in the disparities that have led to literacy issues

06:15:14.660 --> 06:15:15.660
in the first place.

06:15:15.660 --> 06:15:20.660
I think taking the time to pull out and back thread

06:15:20.820 --> 06:15:24.900
and to address that issue and focus on disparities

06:15:24.900 --> 06:15:28.220
as our board president said at the beginning of the day,

06:15:28.220 --> 06:15:33.100
may be the way to address a lot of the buckets of concerns

06:15:33.100 --> 06:15:34.860
we heard among the stakeholders.

06:15:34.860 --> 06:15:35.700
Thank you.

06:15:36.900 --> 06:15:38.940
Thank you very much.

06:15:38.940 --> 06:15:42.100
I think next in the queue is member Glover Woods

06:15:42.100 --> 06:15:44.100
and then member Patil Brownson.

06:15:45.100 --> 06:15:47.540
Thank you very much.

06:15:47.540 --> 06:15:50.100
First of all, I do want to say to Barbara

06:15:50.100 --> 06:15:52.460
and the entire team that's been working on this plan,

06:15:52.460 --> 06:15:53.420
thank you very much.

06:15:53.420 --> 06:15:57.420
I recognize and realize what a monumental task it must be

06:15:57.420 --> 06:16:00.220
to bring together all of these different documents

06:16:00.220 --> 06:16:02.620
that we have that speak to literacy

06:16:02.620 --> 06:16:04.380
and try to bring them together

06:16:04.380 --> 06:16:06.540
in a comprehensive and understanding way.

06:16:06.540 --> 06:16:10.060
And so I first want to let you know how much

06:16:10.060 --> 06:16:14.300
that hard work is appreciated and recognized

06:16:14.300 --> 06:16:18.500
just as a point of feedback and consideration

06:16:18.500 --> 06:16:20.580
in relation to the priorities.

06:16:20.580 --> 06:16:23.580
And I believe one of the callers that called in today

06:16:23.580 --> 06:16:25.540
spoke to this as well.

06:16:25.540 --> 06:16:30.020
In the state priorities for six through 12,

06:16:30.020 --> 06:16:35.020
it speaks to very specifically the asset-based culturally

06:16:35.380 --> 06:16:38.660
and linguistically responsive pedagogy.

06:16:38.860 --> 06:16:41.980
I think it's a misstep that we don't have a statement

06:16:41.980 --> 06:16:45.660
similar to that in the transitional kindergarten

06:16:45.660 --> 06:16:47.380
through fifth grade as well.

06:16:47.380 --> 06:16:49.220
That's a very important piece,

06:16:49.220 --> 06:16:52.460
not just for students that are at the middle school

06:16:52.460 --> 06:16:53.860
and high school level,

06:16:53.860 --> 06:16:57.900
but also for students that are beginning their journey

06:16:57.900 --> 06:17:02.180
into literacy at that transitional kindergarten

06:17:02.180 --> 06:17:03.260
through fifth grade level.

06:17:03.260 --> 06:17:08.020
So I really encourage as the draft is getting finalized

06:17:08.020 --> 06:17:09.780
and will be coming back to us

06:17:09.780 --> 06:17:12.140
that there be strong consideration

06:17:12.140 --> 06:17:17.140
in including that priority in the document itself.

06:17:17.660 --> 06:17:22.340
The other piece that I would just say in closing is,

06:17:22.340 --> 06:17:24.100
and this outlines a little bit

06:17:24.100 --> 06:17:26.580
to Board Member Rucker's comment.

06:17:27.620 --> 06:17:30.820
When we look at the addressing of the disparities,

06:17:31.820 --> 06:17:36.820
how might the grant application for the county offices

06:17:37.420 --> 06:17:39.180
that are going to,

06:17:39.180 --> 06:17:41.020
my understanding was that they will be applying

06:17:41.020 --> 06:17:46.020
or some type of way there will be county offices identified

06:17:47.340 --> 06:17:49.780
to spread this, if you will, throughout the state.

06:17:49.780 --> 06:17:52.100
What might be some things that need to be there

06:17:52.100 --> 06:17:57.020
as pieces of accountability for those grant recipients

06:17:57.020 --> 06:17:59.940
and also the LEAs that are going to be a part of this

06:17:59.940 --> 06:18:03.580
to address the disparities and be very explicit

06:18:03.580 --> 06:18:05.660
in some of the areas that were expressed today

06:18:05.700 --> 06:18:06.820
in the comments.

06:18:06.820 --> 06:18:09.740
The grant application might be a very good place

06:18:09.740 --> 06:18:11.060
to be able to address that

06:18:11.060 --> 06:18:13.460
and ensure that accountability is held.

06:18:13.460 --> 06:18:15.340
So I look forward to the next draft.

06:18:15.340 --> 06:18:18.340
I strongly encourage everyone to look at the feedback

06:18:18.340 --> 06:18:22.140
that we are continuing to receive when finalizing the draft,

06:18:22.140 --> 06:18:24.140
but thank you so much for the hard work.

06:18:25.340 --> 06:18:26.580
Thanks.

06:18:26.580 --> 06:18:29.980
Next is Member Patio-Brownson and then Member Navo.

06:18:31.260 --> 06:18:34.060
I also wanted to join the chorus of appreciation

06:18:34.060 --> 06:18:38.500
for all the stakeholder solicitation and feedback

06:18:38.500 --> 06:18:41.340
and also the stakeholders who participated

06:18:41.340 --> 06:18:45.780
and shared their perspectives today.

06:18:46.740 --> 06:18:51.740
I think particularly what is unique in this presentation

06:18:52.100 --> 06:18:55.220
is it's actually one of the first times

06:18:55.220 --> 06:18:58.940
that the whole birth to 18 continuum

06:18:58.940 --> 06:19:00.300
has actually been funded

06:19:00.300 --> 06:19:03.220
and sort of brought together coherently.

06:19:03.220 --> 06:19:06.100
So I think that is both important

06:19:06.100 --> 06:19:09.180
and hopefully a harbinger of things to come,

06:19:09.180 --> 06:19:11.460
that it is both something that is integrated

06:19:11.460 --> 06:19:15.220
in terms of integration of infant toddler foundations,

06:19:15.220 --> 06:19:16.820
the preschool foundations,

06:19:18.380 --> 06:19:21.500
in terms of what the curriculum looks like,

06:19:21.500 --> 06:19:25.540
but also that it's reflected in the funding formula as well

06:19:25.540 --> 06:19:28.260
with the 15% set aside for birth to five.

06:19:28.900 --> 06:19:33.900
I think the component that is also going to be

06:19:35.980 --> 06:19:39.660
equally important in this TK to five space

06:19:39.660 --> 06:19:41.460
is just to recognize that we're gonna have

06:19:41.460 --> 06:19:45.100
some pretty severe impacts to address

06:19:45.100 --> 06:19:49.540
as a result of COVID and disenrollment.

06:19:49.540 --> 06:19:53.260
The number in LAUSD, which is my home district,

06:19:53.260 --> 06:19:55.780
is that there are 6,000 kindergarten students

06:19:55.780 --> 06:19:58.580
who just didn't show up to school this year.

06:19:58.580 --> 06:20:03.580
And the ELA disadvantage that those kids will come into

06:20:04.900 --> 06:20:09.460
starting a whole new semester in August or September of 21

06:20:09.460 --> 06:20:10.900
is going to be significant.

06:20:11.740 --> 06:20:15.300
The early literacy acquisition that happens in preschool,

06:20:15.300 --> 06:20:18.860
in kindergarten with all of the foundational learning

06:20:18.860 --> 06:20:23.780
around decoding and early literacy tools

06:20:23.820 --> 06:20:26.940
are things that are gonna have to happen at warp speed

06:20:26.940 --> 06:20:30.020
in ways that we haven't actually been able

06:20:30.020 --> 06:20:32.020
to focus on in the past.

06:20:32.020 --> 06:20:35.100
And I'm hopeful that this grant will enable us

06:20:35.100 --> 06:20:37.940
to do some of that work to catch up.

06:20:39.060 --> 06:20:42.780
In particular, two aspects that I wanna call out

06:20:42.780 --> 06:20:46.620
that were also raised during public comment.

06:20:46.620 --> 06:20:49.060
One is about the need to figure out

06:20:49.060 --> 06:20:51.660
how to better balance the foundational skills

06:20:51.700 --> 06:20:54.460
versus the more integrated approach

06:20:54.460 --> 06:20:56.740
in a way that is responsive

06:20:56.740 --> 06:20:59.060
to the needs of dual language learners.

06:20:59.060 --> 06:21:03.820
If you sort of track the demographic trends for zero to five

06:21:03.820 --> 06:21:07.420
and know who your incoming K to 12 population

06:21:07.420 --> 06:21:10.460
will be right now, it's 60% of California's

06:21:10.460 --> 06:21:12.620
zero to five year olds are dual language learners

06:21:12.620 --> 06:21:16.500
who come from homes where another language besides English

06:21:16.500 --> 06:21:18.580
is the predominant language at home.

06:21:18.580 --> 06:21:21.660
And so thinking about how that will influence

06:21:21.660 --> 06:21:23.420
what we need to be ready for

06:21:23.420 --> 06:21:26.580
as we're thinking about an overhaul of our literacy programs

06:21:26.580 --> 06:21:27.740
is all the more important

06:21:27.740 --> 06:21:32.060
to have that balancing calculation lifted up.

06:21:32.060 --> 06:21:33.980
The second is around the language

06:21:33.980 --> 06:21:35.940
of equitable systems of schooling

06:21:35.940 --> 06:21:40.340
and the need to do local needs assessments.

06:21:40.340 --> 06:21:44.260
The numbers are egregious for English English learners,

06:21:44.260 --> 06:21:46.940
but I think it bears emphasis

06:21:46.940 --> 06:21:48.460
that African-American students

06:21:48.460 --> 06:21:52.260
are the single lowest performing ELA group

06:21:52.260 --> 06:21:55.620
and we need to figure out how to do something differently.

06:21:55.620 --> 06:22:00.260
It's a two to two and a half differential,

06:22:00.260 --> 06:22:03.740
sorry, two to two and a third X differential

06:22:03.740 --> 06:22:06.300
between black students and white students

06:22:06.300 --> 06:22:08.140
and black students and Asian-American students.

06:22:08.140 --> 06:22:10.780
And it's something that isn't unique

06:22:10.780 --> 06:22:12.740
to the elementary grades.

06:22:12.740 --> 06:22:14.460
It persists throughout the grades

06:22:14.460 --> 06:22:19.460
where African-American students are coming in at 31%,

06:22:19.660 --> 06:22:22.340
meeting or exceeding standards in third grade

06:22:22.340 --> 06:22:25.100
and not progressing significantly,

06:22:25.100 --> 06:22:26.740
which all I think suggests

06:22:26.740 --> 06:22:29.260
that it does need to be called out in a different way.

06:22:29.260 --> 06:22:31.340
And we do need to have different mechanisms

06:22:31.340 --> 06:22:33.460
for accountability to make sure

06:22:33.460 --> 06:22:35.820
that those numbers move in the future.

06:22:39.180 --> 06:22:40.700
Thank you.

06:22:40.700 --> 06:22:41.900
Member Navo?

06:22:41.900 --> 06:22:43.820
Yeah, I'll be quick board president.

06:22:43.860 --> 06:22:45.340
I got about a quarter tank left.

06:22:45.340 --> 06:22:47.620
I'm getting really tired.

06:22:47.620 --> 06:22:49.300
Getting a break right after this.

06:22:49.300 --> 06:22:51.740
Come on, come on sir.

06:22:51.740 --> 06:22:54.420
Well, I just want to, a couple of things.

06:22:54.420 --> 06:22:55.620
First, Barbara, thank you.

06:22:55.620 --> 06:22:57.820
I appreciate especially the mention

06:22:57.820 --> 06:23:01.940
of the teacher librarians and library model standards,

06:23:01.940 --> 06:23:04.500
as well as the hard work of your team.

06:23:04.500 --> 06:23:07.140
I also heard a lot of comments about the dyslexia issue

06:23:07.140 --> 06:23:09.380
and I know that California has done a lot of work

06:23:09.380 --> 06:23:11.140
with the California Dyslexia Guidelines

06:23:11.140 --> 06:23:12.100
and there's a lot of information

06:23:12.100 --> 06:23:15.580
by the Journal of Pediatrics around screening for dyslexia.

06:23:15.580 --> 06:23:18.500
A lot of good information that I think could be helpful

06:23:18.500 --> 06:23:19.700
to some in the field.

06:23:20.620 --> 06:23:21.700
My quick question is this,

06:23:21.700 --> 06:23:24.540
it's going back to Glover Woods,

06:23:24.540 --> 06:23:27.300
board member Glover Woods comment about the RFA process

06:23:27.300 --> 06:23:31.460
as something to the extent that we can control this.

06:23:31.460 --> 06:23:34.260
I would love to see a process in the RFA

06:23:34.260 --> 06:23:39.260
that awards the grantees the disbursement

06:23:40.100 --> 06:23:44.780
of this $37.5 million beyond just

06:23:44.780 --> 06:23:47.460
that you are a great grant writer,

06:23:48.860 --> 06:23:52.740
that you actually have a track record as a county office

06:23:52.740 --> 06:23:56.140
for supporting your schools with literacy development

06:23:56.140 --> 06:23:58.100
and you can show some evidence

06:23:58.100 --> 06:24:01.740
that we've supported these schools and we've gotten results,

06:24:01.740 --> 06:24:03.540
as opposed to an RFA process

06:24:03.540 --> 06:24:05.740
where because I have a great grant writer,

06:24:05.740 --> 06:24:06.700
I acquire the grant.

06:24:07.700 --> 06:24:09.180
So just something to consider.

06:24:12.060 --> 06:24:14.340
All right, thank you very much.

06:24:14.340 --> 06:24:18.780
I think I've gotten, is there anybody that I did not see?

06:24:18.780 --> 06:24:20.700
Looks like those are all the hands.

06:24:20.700 --> 06:24:21.540
Lots of good advice.

06:24:21.540 --> 06:24:23.220
I'll just add two quick thoughts

06:24:23.220 --> 06:24:27.540
and then we're gonna break for 10 or 15 minutes

06:24:27.540 --> 06:24:29.100
and come back and finish up.

06:24:30.060 --> 06:24:34.180
One is that there is a lot of people referenced,

06:24:34.180 --> 06:24:36.020
quote, the science of reading.

06:24:36.060 --> 06:24:38.820
There is quite a lot of knowledge base

06:24:38.820 --> 06:24:40.220
about the teaching of reading.

06:24:40.220 --> 06:24:42.060
We have many districts

06:24:42.060 --> 06:24:45.700
that have dramatically improved reading performance.

06:24:45.700 --> 06:24:49.180
You know, member Navo is from one of those,

06:24:49.180 --> 06:24:52.380
Sanger is relatively famous for that,

06:24:52.380 --> 06:24:55.260
both generally and for English learners

06:24:55.260 --> 06:24:57.980
and for students with special education needs.

06:24:57.980 --> 06:25:01.620
San Diego, which is one of now the highest performing

06:25:01.620 --> 06:25:05.420
urban districts in the country on the NAEP and so on.

06:25:05.500 --> 06:25:08.580
So I think, and there's a research literature

06:25:09.540 --> 06:25:11.460
about effective programs.

06:25:11.460 --> 06:25:15.260
So it may be useful to put together some synthesis

06:25:17.580 --> 06:25:20.460
and summary of that understanding

06:25:20.460 --> 06:25:25.460
so that districts can refer to what may work for them

06:25:26.180 --> 06:25:29.900
in their context, but may be informed by what is known.

06:25:29.900 --> 06:25:32.860
Certainly we should be asking for that kind of evidence

06:25:32.860 --> 06:25:35.340
when people are writing their grants.

06:25:36.260 --> 06:25:38.420
The second thing I'll just point out is that

06:25:38.420 --> 06:25:41.740
part of the problem is not necessarily always

06:25:41.740 --> 06:25:43.260
the training that teachers receive.

06:25:43.260 --> 06:25:46.220
It's the fact that many teachers don't receive training.

06:25:46.220 --> 06:25:48.940
So we have been in a situation of severe shortage

06:25:48.940 --> 06:25:51.580
for at least five years now.

06:25:51.580 --> 06:25:54.820
And looking at the challenges for African-American students,

06:25:54.820 --> 06:25:58.180
I did an analysis of where those students are.

06:25:59.140 --> 06:26:02.300
African-American students in California are located,

06:26:02.300 --> 06:26:04.420
most of them in only 25 districts

06:26:04.420 --> 06:26:06.860
and in those districts, they're disproportionately

06:26:06.860 --> 06:26:09.580
in the highest poverty schools and in those schools

06:26:09.580 --> 06:26:11.820
is the highest proportion of teachers

06:26:11.820 --> 06:26:15.100
without credentials, without training at all.

06:26:15.100 --> 06:26:16.980
And in many of those districts and schools,

06:26:16.980 --> 06:26:21.180
70 or 80% of the incoming teachers over recent years

06:26:21.180 --> 06:26:23.900
have come in without preparation to teach.

06:26:23.900 --> 06:26:25.500
And so if we want to solve this problem,

06:26:25.500 --> 06:26:28.300
it's not only about upgrading the training

06:26:28.300 --> 06:26:30.380
that some teachers get, but making it possible

06:26:30.380 --> 06:26:32.260
for all teachers to get training

06:26:32.260 --> 06:26:35.020
and putting the incentives and supports in place

06:26:35.020 --> 06:26:38.180
where students are getting a revolving door of teachers

06:26:38.180 --> 06:26:43.180
who haven't had the opportunity to get good training.

06:26:43.380 --> 06:26:48.020
And that gets to a whole nother part of the policy framework

06:26:48.020 --> 06:26:49.940
that we need to have to get to a place

06:26:49.940 --> 06:26:52.860
where all students are in fact getting

06:26:52.860 --> 06:26:55.100
the kind of instruction and reading literacy

06:26:55.100 --> 06:26:56.660
that will benefit them.

06:26:56.660 --> 06:26:58.860
So I want to just add my appreciation

06:26:58.860 --> 06:27:01.700
for all of the work that's gone into the plan,

06:27:01.700 --> 06:27:04.580
and I suggest that we hopefully make it easy

06:27:04.580 --> 06:27:09.580
for folks to access the literature about what works

06:27:10.300 --> 06:27:13.260
and what has worked in our own California districts,

06:27:13.260 --> 06:27:15.740
as well as what works generally

06:27:15.740 --> 06:27:20.340
and also solve the problem of our teacher shortages,

06:27:20.340 --> 06:27:22.740
which the governor's budget does include

06:27:22.740 --> 06:27:26.460
some useful investments in.

06:27:27.500 --> 06:27:29.500
With that, Barbara, thank you very much.

06:27:29.500 --> 06:27:30.620
We really appreciate you.

06:27:30.620 --> 06:27:33.060
We hope you got a lot out of the input,

06:27:33.060 --> 06:27:37.100
all of the additional input on the plan.

06:27:37.100 --> 06:27:42.100
We'll take a 12-minute break till 4.15,

06:27:42.860 --> 06:27:45.660
and I have to attend to an urgent matter,

06:27:45.660 --> 06:27:48.660
so when we come back, Vice President Strauss

06:27:48.660 --> 06:27:50.700
will hold the gavel for a bit,

06:27:50.700 --> 06:27:52.980
and we'll see you at 4.15, thank you.

06:27:57.020 --> 06:27:59.460
We can reestablish a quorum if you'd like.

06:27:59.500 --> 06:28:00.740
Yes, okay, board members,

06:28:00.740 --> 06:28:04.140
we're gonna do a roll call vote to reestablish the quorum,

06:28:04.140 --> 06:28:06.500
so Brooks, would you please do the roll call vote?

06:28:06.500 --> 06:28:07.460
Of course.

06:28:07.460 --> 06:28:08.300
Member Sun.

06:28:10.180 --> 06:28:11.100
Here.

06:28:11.100 --> 06:28:12.660
Member Strauss.

06:28:12.660 --> 06:28:13.500
Here.

06:28:13.500 --> 06:28:15.180
Member Rucker.

06:28:15.180 --> 06:28:16.020
Here.

06:28:16.020 --> 06:28:17.820
Member Rodriguez.

06:28:17.820 --> 06:28:18.660
Here.

06:28:18.660 --> 06:28:19.820
Member Patil-Brownson.

06:28:22.420 --> 06:28:23.300
Here.

06:28:23.300 --> 06:28:24.940
Member Navo.

06:28:24.940 --> 06:28:25.860
Here.

06:28:25.860 --> 06:28:26.820
Member McQuillin.

06:28:27.820 --> 06:28:28.940
Here.

06:28:28.940 --> 06:28:29.980
Member Glover-Woods.

06:28:31.220 --> 06:28:32.460
Here.

06:28:32.460 --> 06:28:34.100
Member Fatah.

06:28:34.100 --> 06:28:35.260
Here.

06:28:35.260 --> 06:28:36.100
Member Burr.

06:28:36.980 --> 06:28:37.820
Here.

06:28:39.740 --> 06:28:41.140
All right, we have a quorum.

06:28:42.260 --> 06:28:43.340
Thank you.

06:28:43.340 --> 06:28:45.740
I'd like to take up our waiver consent calendar,

06:28:45.740 --> 06:28:50.300
which includes waiver items W01 through W04,

06:28:50.300 --> 06:28:53.540
so we'll now open the phone line for public comment queue.

06:28:53.540 --> 06:28:55.700
The slide is up, so members of the public

06:28:55.700 --> 06:28:58.620
wishing to provide comment on any of the items

06:28:59.180 --> 06:29:04.180
may do so by calling now into 712-432-00,

06:29:05.700 --> 06:29:07.660
oh, I guess it's the numbers different,

06:29:07.660 --> 06:29:12.660
770-4906, access code 1166083 pound.

06:29:15.020 --> 06:29:20.020
Are there any public comments on waiver items W01 through W04?

06:29:21.420 --> 06:29:25.100
We do have one speaker signed up in the queue.

06:29:25.100 --> 06:29:26.820
I will open the phone lines now.

06:29:26.820 --> 06:29:30.980
This is for W1 through W4.

06:29:32.020 --> 06:29:33.540
We encourage you to state your name

06:29:33.540 --> 06:29:37.380
and affiliation for the record on the waiver items,

06:29:37.380 --> 06:29:42.100
W01 to W04, and the district name to which you are speaking.

06:29:42.100 --> 06:29:42.940
Thank you.

06:29:45.100 --> 06:29:46.620
My name is Gary Bray.

06:29:46.620 --> 06:29:50.460
I am a management consultant for the county superintendent.

06:29:50.460 --> 06:29:54.700
This is in regard to the waiver for Belbridge School District.

06:29:57.820 --> 06:29:58.660
Go ahead.

06:29:59.940 --> 06:30:00.980
You have one minute.

06:30:02.340 --> 06:30:03.180
Very good.

06:30:04.020 --> 06:30:05.260
My name is Gary Bray.

06:30:05.260 --> 06:30:06.660
I am a management consultant

06:30:06.660 --> 06:30:09.340
for the Kern County Superintendent of Schools.

06:30:09.340 --> 06:30:11.300
I've been appointed as fiscal advisor

06:30:11.300 --> 06:30:13.900
to Belbridge School District.

06:30:13.900 --> 06:30:16.900
This public comment is submitted in support

06:30:16.900 --> 06:30:19.340
of Belbridge's waiver request.

06:30:19.340 --> 06:30:22.740
Excuse me, excuse me, Mr. Bray?

06:30:22.740 --> 06:30:24.820
If you don't mind calling back in just a moment,

06:30:25.340 --> 06:30:29.100
we are taking up W1 through W4 right now,

06:30:29.100 --> 06:30:31.820
and then afterwards we will be taking up W5.

06:30:32.660 --> 06:30:33.500
Oh, that's W5.

06:30:33.500 --> 06:30:35.540
Just hang on the line, please.

06:30:35.540 --> 06:30:36.380
Thank you.

06:30:36.380 --> 06:30:37.220
Thank you.

06:30:38.620 --> 06:30:40.860
Okay, it looks like that concludes public comment

06:30:40.860 --> 06:30:42.620
for W1 through W4.

06:30:43.900 --> 06:30:45.260
Okay, thank you.

06:30:45.260 --> 06:30:47.100
Since there's no other public comment,

06:30:47.100 --> 06:30:50.700
I'll now ask for a motion on waivers W1 through W4.

06:30:50.700 --> 06:30:51.820
Do I have a motion?

06:30:53.540 --> 06:30:54.540
I will move.

06:30:55.380 --> 06:30:56.700
Go ahead, Ting.

06:30:56.700 --> 06:30:57.540
I'll second.

06:30:58.340 --> 06:30:59.180
Okay, I move.

06:31:00.060 --> 06:31:02.540
So we have a motion by Member Sung

06:31:02.540 --> 06:31:04.700
and seconded by Member Navo.

06:31:04.700 --> 06:31:06.300
Now we'll call the roll call vote.

06:31:06.300 --> 06:31:08.340
So Brooks, would you please call the roll?

06:31:09.900 --> 06:31:10.740
Member Sung.

06:31:14.300 --> 06:31:15.700
Aye.

06:31:15.700 --> 06:31:17.660
Vice President Strauss.

06:31:17.660 --> 06:31:18.500
Yes.

06:31:19.660 --> 06:31:20.500
Member Rucker.

06:31:21.380 --> 06:31:22.620
Yes.

06:31:22.620 --> 06:31:23.700
Member Rodriguez.

06:31:24.660 --> 06:31:25.740
Yes.

06:31:25.740 --> 06:31:26.940
Member Patil-Brownson.

06:31:27.980 --> 06:31:29.260
Yes.

06:31:29.260 --> 06:31:30.100
Member Navo.

06:31:31.300 --> 06:31:32.340
Yes.

06:31:32.340 --> 06:31:33.340
Member McQuillan.

06:31:34.340 --> 06:31:35.300
Yes.

06:31:35.300 --> 06:31:36.380
Member Glover-Woods.

06:31:41.500 --> 06:31:42.740
Yes.

06:31:42.740 --> 06:31:43.580
Member Fatah.

06:31:44.540 --> 06:31:46.020
Yes.

06:31:46.020 --> 06:31:47.260
President Darlin-Hammond.

06:31:49.500 --> 06:31:50.340
Member Burr.

06:31:51.100 --> 06:31:51.940
Aye.

06:31:52.940 --> 06:31:53.780
It passes.

06:31:55.660 --> 06:31:56.500
Thank you.

06:31:56.500 --> 06:32:00.540
Now we're going to take up a waiver O5,

06:32:00.540 --> 06:32:01.980
which is a waiver request

06:32:01.980 --> 06:32:04.340
by Bell Ridge Elementary School District

06:32:04.340 --> 06:32:07.180
to waive portions of the California Ed Code sections

06:32:07.180 --> 06:32:11.380
35780 and 35782,

06:32:11.380 --> 06:32:14.620
which will allow the district to lapse.

06:32:14.620 --> 06:32:17.020
I think this item will be recommended,

06:32:17.020 --> 06:32:19.420
will be presented by Larry Shirey from CDE.

06:32:20.380 --> 06:32:22.540
So Larry, welcome.

06:32:22.540 --> 06:32:27.140
Nice to see you and you're welcome to begin.

06:32:28.500 --> 06:32:29.340
Thank you.

06:32:29.340 --> 06:32:32.300
I'm trying to, oh, I guess Alex,

06:32:32.300 --> 06:32:34.700
you've already got the presentation up.

06:32:37.940 --> 06:32:40.460
I'm trying to share my screen here.

06:32:40.460 --> 06:32:43.460
I can't share, well, I know there's a bit of sharing.

06:32:43.460 --> 06:32:44.980
We can see it now.

06:32:44.980 --> 06:32:46.100
Oh no, now it's off.

06:32:53.340 --> 06:32:54.500
Vice President Strauss,

06:32:54.500 --> 06:32:56.780
I think we lost Larry, just hold on one moment.

06:32:56.780 --> 06:33:00.740
I'm still here, it's just that I'm being popped around

06:33:00.740 --> 06:33:03.660
because I can't share my screen.

06:33:03.660 --> 06:33:04.500
I'm sorry.

06:33:04.500 --> 06:33:05.340
I'm sorry.

06:33:05.340 --> 06:33:06.180
I'm sorry.

06:33:06.180 --> 06:33:07.020
I'm sorry.

06:33:07.020 --> 06:33:07.860
I'm sorry.

06:33:07.860 --> 06:33:08.700
I'm sorry.

06:33:08.860 --> 06:33:11.940
Because I can't share my screen right now.

06:33:15.020 --> 06:33:16.980
Alex, and you're able to share?

06:33:16.980 --> 06:33:18.060
I can share Larry,

06:33:18.060 --> 06:33:20.180
would you want me to share it for you?

06:33:20.180 --> 06:33:21.020
Sure.

06:33:21.020 --> 06:33:22.340
You know, I think I can't share it

06:33:22.340 --> 06:33:24.940
because I've been told that someone else is sharing.

06:33:24.940 --> 06:33:26.180
Okay, I will share it for you then.

06:33:26.180 --> 06:33:28.660
And you just tell me when to toggle slides.

06:33:28.660 --> 06:33:31.500
Sorry, go ahead at the beginning, the first slide.

06:33:39.540 --> 06:33:41.180
Can you go to the title slide?

06:33:52.060 --> 06:33:52.900
Can you hear me?

06:33:54.420 --> 06:33:57.220
We can now, and we can see the slide.

06:33:58.380 --> 06:34:01.100
But can we go to the first slide?

06:34:03.460 --> 06:34:04.980
I'm not seeing the first one.

06:34:05.900 --> 06:34:07.220
I'm not sure where we are.

06:34:13.220 --> 06:34:15.940
The slide says Lapsations Statute.

06:34:17.700 --> 06:34:19.660
That's not the one I have and that's.

06:34:25.220 --> 06:34:26.060
That's.

06:34:26.060 --> 06:34:29.180
The slide says Bell Ridge ESD Request.

06:34:29.180 --> 06:34:30.020
Right.

06:34:30.020 --> 06:34:32.180
I'm showing your title slide right now, Larry.

06:34:32.180 --> 06:34:33.020
Okay, I don't see that.

06:34:33.380 --> 06:34:34.620
Okay, I don't see that.

06:34:34.620 --> 06:34:38.260
So I'll just assume that.

06:34:44.180 --> 06:34:45.460
Okay.

06:34:45.460 --> 06:34:47.500
Okay, this is a waiver request

06:34:47.500 --> 06:34:49.460
from the Bell Ridge Elementary School District

06:34:49.460 --> 06:34:50.380
in Kern County.

06:34:51.860 --> 06:34:56.340
It is asking you to waive the threshold

06:34:56.340 --> 06:34:58.180
for lapsing the district.

06:34:58.180 --> 06:34:59.660
Next slide, please.

06:34:59.660 --> 06:35:03.940
And allow it to be annexed into an adjacent district.

06:35:03.940 --> 06:35:07.940
Section, the education code requires

06:35:07.940 --> 06:35:09.740
an elementary district to be lapsed

06:35:09.740 --> 06:35:13.380
if ADA in grades A through eight,

06:35:13.380 --> 06:35:16.140
in grades one through eight falls below six.

06:35:16.140 --> 06:35:20.300
Bell Ridge Elementary has 35 students in it

06:35:21.500 --> 06:35:23.260
and it's asking the State Board

06:35:23.260 --> 06:35:25.900
to waive that six ADA requirements

06:35:25.900 --> 06:35:29.540
so that it would be required to lapse

06:35:30.420 --> 06:35:31.740
regardless of enrollment.

06:35:33.900 --> 06:35:34.740
Next slide.

06:35:36.460 --> 06:35:39.900
The reasons for the request are twofold.

06:35:39.900 --> 06:35:42.420
One is that the district has had great difficulty

06:35:42.420 --> 06:35:44.260
attracting residents from the community

06:35:44.260 --> 06:35:45.980
to serve on the governing board.

06:35:45.980 --> 06:35:48.100
Currently, all members of the district board

06:35:48.100 --> 06:35:51.180
are appointed County Board of Education members

06:35:51.180 --> 06:35:53.900
because a sufficient number of community members

06:35:53.900 --> 06:35:56.340
have not filed for the governing board elections

06:35:56.340 --> 06:35:58.020
or have not responded to requests

06:35:58.020 --> 06:36:00.020
for appointment vacancies on the board.

06:36:01.340 --> 06:36:04.260
I don't see many districts where the number of students

06:36:04.260 --> 06:36:06.780
in the district is twice the number of registered voters,

06:36:06.780 --> 06:36:07.940
which is the case here.

06:36:08.900 --> 06:36:10.860
County Board members have been majority

06:36:10.860 --> 06:36:12.660
on the three-member Bell Ridge Board

06:36:12.660 --> 06:36:14.780
for at least the past decade.

06:36:14.780 --> 06:36:16.740
There has only been one four-year period

06:36:16.740 --> 06:36:18.980
where any member from the community

06:36:18.980 --> 06:36:20.780
was on the district governing board.

06:36:21.820 --> 06:36:24.580
Bell Ridge District has also been under financial stress

06:36:24.580 --> 06:36:25.780
for a number of years.

06:36:26.780 --> 06:36:29.780
The district has a negative certification.

06:36:29.780 --> 06:36:33.780
The County Superintendent has appointed a financial advisor.

06:36:33.780 --> 06:36:35.740
Negative certification means that the district

06:36:35.740 --> 06:36:37.900
will not meet its financial obligations

06:36:37.900 --> 06:36:41.220
for the current or two subsequent fiscal years.

06:36:41.220 --> 06:36:44.700
We have at the CDE have been tracking the status

06:36:44.700 --> 06:36:48.100
of the district because of its negative certification.

06:36:48.100 --> 06:36:51.220
We concur with the County Superintendent's determination

06:36:51.220 --> 06:36:54.540
that the district is facing fiscal insolvency.

06:36:54.540 --> 06:36:56.980
Both the district and the County Superintendent

06:36:56.980 --> 06:37:00.500
agree that expenditures at the district

06:37:00.500 --> 06:37:02.420
cannot be reduced below current levels

06:37:02.420 --> 06:37:05.540
without jeopardizing student learning and safety.

06:37:05.540 --> 06:37:06.380
Next slide.

06:37:09.620 --> 06:37:12.060
State Board approval of this waiver

06:37:12.060 --> 06:37:14.300
will trigger Kern County actions

06:37:14.300 --> 06:37:17.740
to lapse or dissolve Bell Ridge District

06:37:17.740 --> 06:37:19.820
and annex it to an adjacent district.

06:37:21.340 --> 06:37:23.460
You've dealt with these waivers before.

06:37:23.780 --> 06:37:26.780
You've had 12 similar waivers over the past decade.

06:37:26.780 --> 06:37:28.220
We haven't talked about them much

06:37:28.220 --> 06:37:31.380
because prior to the waiver coming in,

06:37:31.380 --> 06:37:34.340
they've been able to work out a local resolution

06:37:34.340 --> 06:37:37.900
in terms of which district will be annexing

06:37:37.900 --> 06:37:39.660
the lapsing district.

06:37:39.660 --> 06:37:41.100
That's not the case here,

06:37:41.100 --> 06:37:44.020
despite the County Superintendent working with the districts

06:37:44.020 --> 06:37:46.180
for at least the past year

06:37:46.180 --> 06:37:47.980
that I've been in contact with her.

06:37:49.820 --> 06:37:51.180
They have opposition.

06:37:51.180 --> 06:37:53.020
The McKittrick Elementary School District

06:37:53.580 --> 06:37:57.140
is the most likely recipient of a lapsed Bell Ridge District.

06:37:57.140 --> 06:37:59.660
They are opposed, and it's our understanding

06:37:59.660 --> 06:38:03.820
that McKittrick will be addressing you today.

06:38:03.820 --> 06:38:08.140
Given that, we thought that we should probably talk

06:38:08.140 --> 06:38:12.420
just a little bit about the lapsation process,

06:38:12.420 --> 06:38:14.460
and I'm going to provide some very brief

06:38:14.460 --> 06:38:17.500
background information on the affected districts

06:38:17.500 --> 06:38:18.900
and things that the County Committee

06:38:18.900 --> 06:38:22.500
on School District Organization will be considering

06:38:22.900 --> 06:38:25.300
or may be considering when they determine

06:38:25.300 --> 06:38:27.300
where to annex the district

06:38:27.300 --> 06:38:30.140
should you approve the waiver.

06:38:30.140 --> 06:38:34.100
Again, I'm only providing this information for background.

06:38:34.980 --> 06:38:38.900
What you're doing today is simply moving the county forward

06:38:38.900 --> 06:38:40.940
to begin the lapsation process.

06:38:40.940 --> 06:38:43.620
You do not have a role to play in determining

06:38:43.620 --> 06:38:46.180
which district will annex the territory.

06:38:46.180 --> 06:38:48.140
That's the County, the Education Code

06:38:48.140 --> 06:38:51.100
gives that responsibility to the County Committee.

06:38:51.140 --> 06:38:52.140
Next slide, please.

06:38:55.420 --> 06:38:58.500
This table contains Bell Ridge District

06:38:58.500 --> 06:39:01.780
and the four potential districts that would annex it

06:39:01.780 --> 06:39:03.460
if it were to lapse.

06:39:04.740 --> 06:39:06.140
A little bit of background information,

06:39:06.140 --> 06:39:08.140
but the most important piece here

06:39:09.260 --> 06:39:11.740
is the Union High School District

06:39:11.740 --> 06:39:14.020
in which the districts are components.

06:39:14.020 --> 06:39:16.300
Bell Ridge is a component of TAF.

06:39:16.300 --> 06:39:19.180
McKittrick is also a component of TAF,

06:39:19.180 --> 06:39:20.620
whereas the other three districts

06:39:20.620 --> 06:39:23.140
are components of other high school districts.

06:39:23.140 --> 06:39:25.580
What that means is if Bell Ridge lapses

06:39:25.580 --> 06:39:28.580
into one of the three districts in the bottom of the table,

06:39:28.580 --> 06:39:30.860
then there's also a boundary change

06:39:30.860 --> 06:39:34.300
with the high school district and relocation of

06:39:34.300 --> 06:39:39.300
or redesignation of residency for a few high school students,

06:39:39.740 --> 06:39:41.220
something that the County Committee

06:39:41.220 --> 06:39:43.140
might take into consideration.

06:39:43.140 --> 06:39:44.140
Next slide, please.

06:39:44.980 --> 06:39:49.740
The County Committee likely will also take into effect

06:39:49.740 --> 06:39:51.940
educational program effects.

06:39:54.500 --> 06:39:57.540
In this case, Bell Ridge has,

06:39:57.540 --> 06:39:59.700
and one of the things they might look at

06:39:59.700 --> 06:40:03.300
is the numbers of English language EL students

06:40:03.300 --> 06:40:06.900
in the districts and the change in program

06:40:06.900 --> 06:40:11.620
that might come into play if student composition

06:40:11.620 --> 06:40:13.660
is changed in McKittrick.

06:40:13.700 --> 06:40:18.700
As you can see, Bell Ridge is over 30% EL students.

06:40:19.180 --> 06:40:20.780
If you call from the previous table,

06:40:20.780 --> 06:40:23.740
the other three districts that aren't in this table here

06:40:23.740 --> 06:40:26.540
are all well over 50% EL.

06:40:26.540 --> 06:40:28.980
McKittrick has no EL students.

06:40:28.980 --> 06:40:30.740
That's one thing that the County Committee

06:40:30.740 --> 06:40:34.500
may take into account this educational program effect

06:40:34.500 --> 06:40:38.740
when they decide where to annex the lapsed Bell Ridge district.

06:40:38.740 --> 06:40:40.540
Another consideration may be the fact

06:40:40.540 --> 06:40:42.900
that McKittrick is a district of choice.

06:40:42.940 --> 06:40:45.900
About two thirds of its students are from out of district

06:40:45.900 --> 06:40:50.060
attending school through the districts

06:40:50.060 --> 06:40:52.060
district of choice program.

06:40:52.060 --> 06:40:53.100
Next slide, please.

06:40:56.820 --> 06:40:58.900
The most important thing that the County Committee

06:40:58.900 --> 06:41:01.300
is gonna take a look at is the fiscal effect

06:41:02.060 --> 06:41:06.860
of annexing Bell Ridge upon lapsation.

06:41:06.860 --> 06:41:11.860
Bell Ridge and both Bell Ridge and McKittrick

06:41:12.180 --> 06:41:13.580
are basic aid districts.

06:41:15.060 --> 06:41:19.100
You can kind of see the difference in the revenue per ADA

06:41:19.100 --> 06:41:21.020
in the far right column.

06:41:21.020 --> 06:41:24.140
Basic aid districts tend to have higher numbers there.

06:41:24.140 --> 06:41:25.220
Bell Ridge isn't listed,

06:41:25.220 --> 06:41:28.700
but their revenue limit is over 15,000 per student.

06:41:30.020 --> 06:41:35.020
The second column is the County Superintendent's

06:41:35.260 --> 06:41:38.300
projected effect the first year of lapsation

06:41:38.300 --> 06:41:41.620
in terms of looking at revenue minus expenditures

06:41:41.620 --> 06:41:43.380
after annexation.

06:41:43.380 --> 06:41:45.420
Again, as basic aid districts,

06:41:45.420 --> 06:41:49.780
McKittrick is the only district here that would benefit

06:41:49.780 --> 06:41:51.900
from the property tax revenue from Bell Ridge.

06:41:51.900 --> 06:41:54.740
The other three districts are LCFF funded.

06:41:54.740 --> 06:41:55.660
Next slide, please.

06:41:57.220 --> 06:42:00.420
Again, the County Committee is going to be looking

06:42:00.420 --> 06:42:04.780
at all of these issues, fiscal, educational program,

06:42:04.780 --> 06:42:06.380
and other administrative issues

06:42:06.380 --> 06:42:10.700
that could be affected by annexation

06:42:10.700 --> 06:42:12.180
when it makes its determination

06:42:12.180 --> 06:42:15.300
where to annex the lapsed territory

06:42:15.300 --> 06:42:17.060
of the Bell Ridge School District.

06:42:17.060 --> 06:42:20.940
And annexation includes not just the territory,

06:42:20.940 --> 06:42:23.340
but all the fund balances and obligations,

06:42:23.340 --> 06:42:26.540
students, property, and staff.

06:42:27.660 --> 06:42:30.740
Again, that's the County Committee's responsibility

06:42:30.740 --> 06:42:34.700
to do that, and it's not a role

06:42:34.700 --> 06:42:36.900
that the state has any say into.

06:42:37.940 --> 06:42:38.900
Next slide, please.

06:42:41.180 --> 06:42:43.940
One of the key players, obviously,

06:42:43.940 --> 06:42:46.100
is the County Superintendent's goals.

06:42:46.100 --> 06:42:49.540
County Superintendent has fiscal oversight responsibility

06:42:49.540 --> 06:42:51.700
for all the districts in her county.

06:42:51.700 --> 06:42:53.820
Mary Barlow, the current County Superintendent,

06:42:53.820 --> 06:42:57.700
recognizes that there may be some negative fiscal effects

06:42:57.700 --> 06:43:00.540
on any district that's annexing Bell Ridge,

06:43:00.540 --> 06:43:03.220
so she's taken some pretty extraordinary steps

06:43:04.260 --> 06:43:07.660
to try to make the annexation process

06:43:07.660 --> 06:43:08.860
a little more positive.

06:43:09.700 --> 06:43:12.500
Bell Ridge, before this school year,

06:43:12.500 --> 06:43:16.740
had six employees, not counting the Principal Superintendent

06:43:16.740 --> 06:43:19.820
who will be retiring at the end of this year.

06:43:19.820 --> 06:43:22.780
As part of budget-cutting moves,

06:43:22.780 --> 06:43:24.780
the district laid off three of these,

06:43:24.780 --> 06:43:27.540
half of her employees for the current school year.

06:43:28.620 --> 06:43:32.300
The County Superintendent, in turn, hired those employees

06:43:32.300 --> 06:43:35.300
and has assigned them back to the Bell Ridge School District.

06:43:35.300 --> 06:43:36.980
What that means is that Bell Ridge

06:43:36.980 --> 06:43:39.980
is not having that cost,

06:43:39.980 --> 06:43:44.780
and therefore, they're not draining their reserves,

06:43:44.780 --> 06:43:48.460
their funds as fast as they might be,

06:43:48.460 --> 06:43:51.020
and therefore, there'll be more money available

06:43:51.020 --> 06:43:53.820
for the district that annexes the Bell Ridge,

06:43:53.820 --> 06:43:54.820
should it be lapsed.

06:43:56.220 --> 06:44:00.380
The County Superintendent also had a offer on the table

06:44:00.380 --> 06:44:04.060
to reimburse whatever district annexes Bell Ridge

06:44:04.060 --> 06:44:06.580
for the remaining three employees.

06:44:07.100 --> 06:44:09.620
I don't believe that offer still is on the table,

06:44:09.620 --> 06:44:12.740
but the County Superintendent has given assurances

06:44:12.740 --> 06:44:17.540
that she will take care of the three remaining employees,

06:44:17.540 --> 06:44:21.180
either through a new agreement, similar agreement,

06:44:21.180 --> 06:44:22.660
or the County Superintendent

06:44:22.660 --> 06:44:24.860
may hire the employees herself.

06:44:25.740 --> 06:44:28.020
What that does then is that the district

06:44:28.020 --> 06:44:30.900
that annexes Bell Ridge will be relieved

06:44:30.900 --> 06:44:35.300
of probably the biggest cost of taking on Bell Ridge District.

06:44:35.300 --> 06:44:38.220
That's the employee cost compensation.

06:44:39.260 --> 06:44:40.180
Next slide, please.

06:44:42.180 --> 06:44:46.020
So in summary, we've got a local determination

06:44:46.020 --> 06:44:49.780
that Bell Ridge Elementary School District

06:44:49.780 --> 06:44:52.780
is not a viable entity for the two reasons

06:44:52.780 --> 06:44:54.660
that I've already gone through.

06:44:54.660 --> 06:44:58.420
CDE agrees with that local determination.

06:44:58.420 --> 06:45:00.340
The Bell Ridge District is requesting

06:45:00.340 --> 06:45:02.380
that the State Board approve a waiver

06:45:02.700 --> 06:45:06.180
that the County actions to lapse the district can begin.

06:45:06.180 --> 06:45:09.300
Lapsation and the subsequent annexation of Bell Ridge

06:45:09.300 --> 06:45:11.060
are County responsibilities.

06:45:12.020 --> 06:45:13.580
State Board approval of the waiver

06:45:13.580 --> 06:45:17.940
does not include direction regarding these responsibilities.

06:45:17.940 --> 06:45:19.260
Department's recommendation

06:45:19.260 --> 06:45:21.220
is that the State Board of Education

06:45:21.220 --> 06:45:26.220
approve the Bell Ridge ESD's request for waiver.

06:45:27.700 --> 06:45:30.620
I can respond to any technical questions

06:45:30.620 --> 06:45:32.060
or clarifying questions now

06:45:32.700 --> 06:45:33.820
and certainly after public comment,

06:45:33.820 --> 06:45:35.820
I'll be available for any other questions.

06:45:35.820 --> 06:45:36.660
Thank you.

06:45:48.620 --> 06:45:52.140
I'll continue with this item and just ask,

06:45:52.140 --> 06:45:55.420
we're gonna put the slide up for public comment

06:45:55.420 --> 06:45:58.300
for members of the public wishing to provide comment

06:45:58.300 --> 06:46:00.300
and while we're waiting for the members of the public

06:46:00.340 --> 06:46:02.420
to call in, I'd ask member Rucker

06:46:02.420 --> 06:46:04.500
if you have any initial comments

06:46:04.500 --> 06:46:05.700
and then we'll ask board members

06:46:05.700 --> 06:46:07.780
if you wanna ask a clarifying question.

06:46:07.780 --> 06:46:10.740
Sure and I wanna thank the staff.

06:46:10.740 --> 06:46:15.740
Larry Shirey is very, very technically advanced

06:46:16.500 --> 06:46:18.700
on dealing with these lapsation issues

06:46:18.700 --> 06:46:19.580
and he is correct.

06:46:19.580 --> 06:46:22.660
We have dealt with lapsations in the past

06:46:22.660 --> 06:46:25.060
and it usually hasn't percolated up

06:46:25.060 --> 06:46:27.020
to this level of attention

06:46:27.020 --> 06:46:30.380
but there is a great deal of controversy

06:46:30.380 --> 06:46:33.460
at the local level around many of the concerns

06:46:33.460 --> 06:46:34.860
that he's laid out.

06:46:34.860 --> 06:46:37.180
So I want to tell my colleagues on the board

06:46:37.180 --> 06:46:41.380
that the State Board has a very narrow role

06:46:41.380 --> 06:46:45.060
in this process and in this issue

06:46:45.060 --> 06:46:47.620
and it simply is to approve

06:46:47.620 --> 06:46:51.340
or consider approving the waiver request

06:46:51.340 --> 06:46:53.660
from the Bell Ridge District.

06:46:53.660 --> 06:46:56.140
If the board approves the Bell Ridge

06:46:56.180 --> 06:46:58.900
Elementary School District waiver request,

06:46:58.900 --> 06:47:01.900
the county committee will consider

06:47:01.900 --> 06:47:05.100
the superintendent's county fiscal analysis

06:47:05.100 --> 06:47:07.940
along with other relevant information

06:47:07.940 --> 06:47:11.420
to make decisions that will go forward on the process

06:47:11.420 --> 06:47:15.340
regarding which districts will annex Bell Ridge.

06:47:15.340 --> 06:47:18.740
I wanna emphasize what Larry explained.

06:47:18.740 --> 06:47:22.620
The board's approval of the waiver does not,

06:47:22.620 --> 06:47:25.460
the waiver request does not include

06:47:25.460 --> 06:47:28.180
a determination by this board

06:47:28.180 --> 06:47:31.580
of which district will annex the lapsed territory

06:47:31.580 --> 06:47:33.100
of Bell Ridge.

06:47:33.100 --> 06:47:36.780
The waiver approval would require the county committee

06:47:36.780 --> 06:47:39.300
to conduct, to do the lapsation

06:47:39.300 --> 06:47:42.420
and order that the district's territory be annexed

06:47:42.420 --> 06:47:44.860
to one or more adjourning districts

06:47:44.860 --> 06:47:47.500
as it seems to the county committee

06:47:47.500 --> 06:47:51.180
to be in the best interest of adjourning districts

06:47:51.180 --> 06:47:53.540
and the residents of the lapsed district.

06:47:53.540 --> 06:47:55.380
I took on and really looked at

06:47:55.380 --> 06:47:59.900
and studied Ed Code section 357-80

06:47:59.900 --> 06:48:03.100
to make sure I understood and was very clear.

06:48:03.100 --> 06:48:06.820
Our only role in dealing with this waiver

06:48:06.820 --> 06:48:11.700
is to approve or consider approving the waiver request.

06:48:11.700 --> 06:48:14.140
I do recommend we approve it

06:48:14.140 --> 06:48:16.860
because it gives the actions for the county superintendent

06:48:16.860 --> 06:48:19.220
to recognize the annexation

06:48:19.220 --> 06:48:22.700
and as a result to do the work to take a look at

06:48:22.700 --> 06:48:24.980
and move forward on the considerable amount

06:48:24.980 --> 06:48:28.220
of time and resources and efforts she's already done

06:48:28.220 --> 06:48:32.100
to inform the process that's taking place

06:48:32.100 --> 06:48:33.180
at the county level.

06:48:35.380 --> 06:48:37.620
Thank you, member Rucker for your comments.

06:48:37.620 --> 06:48:41.060
Do we have any board clarifying questions?

06:48:41.940 --> 06:48:44.780
Just looking to see if I see any hands raised.

06:48:44.780 --> 06:48:45.700
Anybody?

06:48:46.700 --> 06:48:49.900
So I don't see any hands raised right now.

06:48:49.900 --> 06:48:53.300
So are there any public comments?

06:48:53.300 --> 06:48:56.020
Yes, we have four people signed up in the queue.

06:48:56.020 --> 06:48:57.420
I will open the phone lines up.

06:48:57.420 --> 06:48:59.540
This is for waiver W5.

06:49:00.580 --> 06:49:02.540
Well, we encourage you to please state your name

06:49:02.540 --> 06:49:04.460
and affiliation for the record.

06:49:04.460 --> 06:49:06.540
Remember to turn down the volume of your computer

06:49:06.540 --> 06:49:08.300
if you're following the live feed

06:49:08.300 --> 06:49:11.340
and remember speakers, you are limited to one minute each.

06:49:11.340 --> 06:49:12.180
Thank you.

06:49:16.180 --> 06:49:17.340
Good afternoon.

06:49:17.340 --> 06:49:18.980
My name is Gary Bray.

06:49:18.980 --> 06:49:20.660
I am a management consultant

06:49:20.660 --> 06:49:23.140
for Kern County Superintendent of Schools.

06:49:23.140 --> 06:49:25.140
I have been appointed as fiscal advisor

06:49:25.140 --> 06:49:27.340
to Bell Ridge School District.

06:49:27.340 --> 06:49:29.500
This public comment is submitted in support

06:49:29.500 --> 06:49:31.300
of Bell Ridge's waiver request.

06:49:32.340 --> 06:49:35.540
Bell Ridge School District currently serves 25 students,

06:49:35.540 --> 06:49:37.980
but fewer than a third of the district's total enrollment

06:49:37.980 --> 06:49:40.300
resides within its boundaries.

06:49:40.300 --> 06:49:43.140
The district has been facing declining enrollment,

06:49:43.140 --> 06:49:46.300
fiscal insolvency and a continuing inability

06:49:46.300 --> 06:49:49.500
to establish a local governance team.

06:49:49.500 --> 06:49:52.260
The district is committed to working collaboratively

06:49:52.260 --> 06:49:56.260
with any annexing district and the county committee

06:49:56.260 --> 06:49:59.460
to achieve as smooth a transition as possible

06:49:59.460 --> 06:50:02.540
for both Bell Ridge and any annexing district.

06:50:02.540 --> 06:50:04.700
The school community understands that lapsation

06:50:04.700 --> 06:50:08.900
is necessary and is prepared and in agreement with lapsing

06:50:08.900 --> 06:50:10.780
at the end of this school year.

06:50:10.780 --> 06:50:12.460
Thank you for your time.

06:50:12.460 --> 06:50:13.300
Thank you.

06:50:17.020 --> 06:50:17.860
Good afternoon.

06:50:17.860 --> 06:50:19.740
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:50:19.740 --> 06:50:22.820
You have one minute and your time starts now.

06:50:22.820 --> 06:50:24.420
Good afternoon, members of the board.

06:50:24.420 --> 06:50:25.860
My name is Mary Barlow

06:50:25.860 --> 06:50:29.100
and I am the Kern County Superintendent of Schools.

06:50:29.100 --> 06:50:32.140
I want to add my voice in full support

06:50:32.140 --> 06:50:35.740
of Larry Shiree's analysis and recommendation

06:50:35.740 --> 06:50:37.340
of the waiver request submitted

06:50:37.340 --> 06:50:39.500
by the Bell Ridge School District.

06:50:39.500 --> 06:50:43.060
If the waiver is granted, my office will work closely

06:50:43.060 --> 06:50:44.380
with the Kern County Committee

06:50:44.380 --> 06:50:46.660
on School District Organization

06:50:46.660 --> 06:50:49.780
to determine which of the contiguous elementary districts

06:50:49.780 --> 06:50:52.500
will be the best choice to assume the territory

06:50:52.500 --> 06:50:55.300
and educational responsibilities of Bell Ridge.

06:50:55.300 --> 06:50:58.500
And we stand ready to assist the annexing districts

06:50:58.500 --> 06:51:00.660
with planning and communication

06:51:00.660 --> 06:51:03.740
to address student and staff concerns.

06:51:03.740 --> 06:51:05.700
But most importantly, we'll work to ensure

06:51:05.700 --> 06:51:07.020
that the students of Bell Ridge

06:51:07.020 --> 06:51:09.980
receive an equitable educational opportunity.

06:51:09.980 --> 06:51:12.780
And we look forward to finding a local solution

06:51:12.780 --> 06:51:16.580
that best meets the needs of students of Kern County.

06:51:16.580 --> 06:51:19.260
I also stand ready to answer any questions

06:51:19.260 --> 06:51:21.420
that the SBE may have related to our work

06:51:21.420 --> 06:51:23.340
to date in this process.

06:51:23.340 --> 06:51:26.260
Thank you for your consideration of this waiver request.

06:51:26.260 --> 06:51:27.100
Thank you.

06:51:29.740 --> 06:51:30.580
Good afternoon.

06:51:30.580 --> 06:51:32.300
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:51:32.300 --> 06:51:35.260
You have one minute and your time starts now.

06:51:35.260 --> 06:51:36.220
My name is Barry Koerner.

06:51:36.380 --> 06:51:38.540
Superintendent McKittrick Elementary School District.

06:51:38.540 --> 06:51:41.100
For generations, Bell Ridge and McKittrick schools

06:51:41.100 --> 06:51:43.620
have considered themselves to be a common community.

06:51:43.620 --> 06:51:44.820
For several months, the staff

06:51:44.820 --> 06:51:46.460
of the Kern County Superintendent of Schools,

06:51:46.460 --> 06:51:47.860
Bell Ridge and McKittrick have discussed

06:51:47.860 --> 06:51:50.180
the Bell Ridge's potential lapsation.

06:51:50.180 --> 06:51:52.660
However, lack of clarity regarding the long-term fiscal

06:51:52.660 --> 06:51:54.980
impact of merging the two districts spurred McKittrick

06:51:54.980 --> 06:51:57.660
to initiate a neutral third-party budget review

06:51:57.660 --> 06:52:00.100
conducted by School Services of California.

06:52:00.100 --> 06:52:02.300
This revealed that the lapsation would add

06:52:02.300 --> 06:52:04.260
a significant financial burden to McKittrick

06:52:04.260 --> 06:52:06.020
and accelerate deficit spending.

06:52:06.820 --> 06:52:07.900
We hope that this board and the county committee

06:52:07.900 --> 06:52:10.260
will consider the negative impact

06:52:10.260 --> 06:52:12.780
on the district's students, staff, and communities.

06:52:12.780 --> 06:52:15.420
We remain committed to collaborating with all stakeholders

06:52:15.420 --> 06:52:17.980
to determine the best path of lapsation

06:52:17.980 --> 06:52:21.340
for Bell Ridge back into McKittrick if possible.

06:52:21.340 --> 06:52:24.380
The Bell Ridge and McKittrick students are in our hearts

06:52:24.380 --> 06:52:29.380
and we ask for honest and direct consideration of finances

06:52:29.820 --> 06:52:33.420
including Bell Ridge's significant unfunded OPED liability.

06:52:33.420 --> 06:52:36.380
This will ensure all possible outcomes of lapsation

06:52:36.380 --> 06:52:37.900
are equally evaluated.

06:52:37.900 --> 06:52:38.740
Thank you.

06:52:38.740 --> 06:52:39.560
Thank you.

06:52:42.260 --> 06:52:43.100
Good afternoon.

06:52:43.100 --> 06:52:44.780
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:52:44.780 --> 06:52:47.020
You have one minute and your time starts now.

06:52:48.300 --> 06:52:49.300
Hi, good afternoon.

06:52:49.300 --> 06:52:50.540
My name is Erin Stagg.

06:52:50.540 --> 06:52:52.820
I am legal counsel for Bell Ridge Elementary School

06:52:52.820 --> 06:52:55.940
District and was requested to provide public comment

06:52:55.940 --> 06:52:58.380
in support of the waiver by Superintendent Reynolds

06:52:58.380 --> 06:52:59.940
and the board president.

06:52:59.940 --> 06:53:02.460
As the board has heard and Mr. Shirey presented,

06:53:02.460 --> 06:53:04.820
the district faces significant budget concerns

06:53:04.820 --> 06:53:07.660
and has a least decade long history

06:53:07.660 --> 06:53:10.580
of difficulty seating and governance team.

06:53:10.580 --> 06:53:13.540
The waiver request was submitted because lapsation

06:53:13.540 --> 06:53:16.660
would allow the district to move quickly and efficiently

06:53:16.660 --> 06:53:19.180
to get families settled in a new district.

06:53:19.180 --> 06:53:21.140
The stakeholder groups, they were included

06:53:21.140 --> 06:53:24.260
in the conversations regarding a proposed lapsation

06:53:24.260 --> 06:53:27.420
and the school community supports lapsation at this time.

06:53:27.420 --> 06:53:30.380
I do want to concur that Bell Ridge and McKittrick

06:53:30.380 --> 06:53:32.140
have been working closely together

06:53:32.780 --> 06:53:34.220
and have continued to work collaboratively

06:53:34.220 --> 06:53:37.100
to answer some of the questions that McKittrick has had

06:53:37.100 --> 06:53:40.620
and Bell Ridge remains committed to working collaboratively

06:53:40.620 --> 06:53:43.180
with any annexing district and the county committee

06:53:43.180 --> 06:53:44.980
should this waiver be approved.

06:53:44.980 --> 06:53:48.260
We thank the board for your time, for your comments

06:53:48.260 --> 06:53:51.300
and respectfully request that the waiver be approved.

06:53:51.300 --> 06:53:52.860
Thank you.

06:53:52.860 --> 06:53:55.780
That concludes public comment for waiver W-5.

06:53:57.340 --> 06:54:00.100
So now we're open for board discussions of board members.

06:54:00.100 --> 06:54:01.300
Please remember to raise your hand

06:54:01.300 --> 06:54:03.380
to the participant panel of Zoom

06:54:03.380 --> 06:54:05.660
if you have a question or a comment.

06:54:05.660 --> 06:54:08.700
Do we have any comments from board members or question?

06:54:12.900 --> 06:54:13.900
I see none.

06:54:15.300 --> 06:54:19.100
So let me ask, is there a motion?

06:54:20.500 --> 06:54:23.180
I will move the staff recommendation

06:54:23.180 --> 06:54:26.060
to approve the waiver

06:54:26.060 --> 06:54:28.660
from the Bell Ridge Elementary School District.

06:54:28.660 --> 06:54:29.700
Do we have a second?

06:54:30.660 --> 06:54:31.500
I'll second.

06:54:32.620 --> 06:54:35.100
Member Navo second, thank you.

06:54:35.100 --> 06:54:37.460
Any further board member discussion?

06:54:40.500 --> 06:54:44.700
Okay, so Brooks, would you take a roll call vote

06:54:44.700 --> 06:54:48.380
on this motion to approve the CDE recommendation?

06:54:49.260 --> 06:54:50.700
Of course, member Sun.

06:54:52.140 --> 06:54:53.500
Aye.

06:54:53.500 --> 06:54:55.380
Vice President Strauss.

06:54:55.380 --> 06:54:56.780
Yes.

06:54:56.780 --> 06:54:58.300
Member Rucker.

06:54:58.300 --> 06:54:59.340
Aye.

06:54:59.340 --> 06:55:00.380
Member Rodriguez.

06:55:04.340 --> 06:55:05.660
Aye.

06:55:05.660 --> 06:55:06.900
Member Patil Brownson.

06:55:07.780 --> 06:55:08.900
Yes.

06:55:08.900 --> 06:55:10.540
Member Navo.

06:55:10.540 --> 06:55:11.500
Yes.

06:55:11.500 --> 06:55:13.260
Member McQuillan.

06:55:13.260 --> 06:55:14.260
Yes.

06:55:14.260 --> 06:55:15.340
Member Glover Woods.

06:55:16.420 --> 06:55:17.420
Yes.

06:55:17.420 --> 06:55:18.260
Member Patel.

06:55:19.180 --> 06:55:20.220
Yes.

06:55:20.220 --> 06:55:22.260
President Darling-Hammond.

06:55:22.260 --> 06:55:23.500
Yes.

06:55:23.500 --> 06:55:25.140
Member Burr.

06:55:25.140 --> 06:55:26.340
Yes.

06:55:26.340 --> 06:55:27.740
It's approved unanimously.

06:55:29.900 --> 06:55:30.740
Terrific.

06:55:32.740 --> 06:55:36.220
So I will go ahead then with the next consent agenda,

06:55:37.900 --> 06:55:41.020
which is regular items seven through 14.

06:55:42.380 --> 06:55:44.100
We're going to do this in two votes,

06:55:44.100 --> 06:55:47.340
item seven and then items eight through 14

06:55:47.340 --> 06:55:51.020
so that we can take a cut of recusals.

06:55:51.020 --> 06:55:55.980
First, we'll take up item seven, the CTEIG allocations.

06:55:55.980 --> 06:55:58.300
Cynthia and Eileen, please recuse yourselves

06:55:58.300 --> 06:56:01.100
by turning off your cameras and microphones

06:56:01.100 --> 06:56:02.460
and magically disappearing.

06:56:03.500 --> 06:56:06.700
We will now open the phone line for public comment

06:56:06.700 --> 06:56:08.340
on consent item seven.

06:56:09.820 --> 06:56:12.860
And the public comment slide is up.

06:56:12.860 --> 06:56:15.860
If you want to provide comment on item seven,

06:56:15.860 --> 06:56:18.180
call the number listed on the slide

06:56:18.180 --> 06:56:21.100
and enter the access code noted there.

06:56:22.180 --> 06:56:25.740
Are there any public comments on regular consent item seven?

06:56:26.620 --> 06:56:27.460
No, there's none.

06:56:29.100 --> 06:56:29.940
All right.

06:56:31.260 --> 06:56:33.980
If there are no further public comments,

06:56:33.980 --> 06:56:37.380
I will ask for a motion on consent for item seven.

06:56:37.380 --> 06:56:38.500
Do I have a motion?

06:56:40.060 --> 06:56:42.060
I will move consent item seven.

06:56:42.060 --> 06:56:42.900
Thank you very much.

06:56:42.900 --> 06:56:44.580

06:56:44.580 --> 06:56:46.060
I will second.

06:56:46.060 --> 06:56:48.100
Thank you very much, Member Rucker.

06:56:48.980 --> 06:56:50.420
We will now hold a roll call vote.

06:56:50.420 --> 06:56:52.540

06:57:21.180 --> 06:57:22.020
It's approved.

06:57:22.820 --> 06:57:23.660
All right.

06:57:23.660 --> 06:57:24.500
Thank you.

06:57:24.500 --> 06:57:27.060
So, Patricia Dacasse,

06:57:27.060 --> 06:57:29.700
can you please let Cynthia and Eileen know

06:57:29.700 --> 06:57:31.660

06:57:31.660 --> 06:57:34.580
And Member Sun, will you please recuse yourself

06:57:34.580 --> 06:57:36.980
by turning off your camera and your microphone?

06:57:38.300 --> 06:57:41.380
And let's see when Cynthia and Eileen have returned.

06:57:41.380 --> 06:57:42.940
I see Eileen.

06:57:42.940 --> 06:57:43.760
Oh, we're good.

06:57:43.760 --> 06:57:44.820
Okay.

06:57:44.820 --> 06:57:48.460
I will now take up consent items eight through 14.

06:57:48.460 --> 06:57:50.700
And please open the phone line for public comment

06:57:50.700 --> 06:57:53.540
on regular consent items eight through 14.

06:57:53.540 --> 06:57:56.100
Members of the public wishing to provide comment,

06:57:56.100 --> 06:58:00.220
they do so by calling the number listed on the slide

06:58:00.220 --> 06:58:03.660
and entering the access code that is noted there.

06:58:03.660 --> 06:58:05.580
Are there any public comments

06:58:05.580 --> 06:58:08.300
on regular consent items eight through 14?

06:58:09.300 --> 06:58:10.140
No, there's not.

06:58:11.660 --> 06:58:12.500
All right.

06:58:12.500 --> 06:58:14.100
Given that there's no public comment,

06:58:14.100 --> 06:58:18.020
I'll ask for a motion for consent on items eight through 14.

06:58:18.020 --> 06:58:21.180
I move the consent items eight through 14.

06:58:21.180 --> 06:58:22.020
Thank you.

06:58:22.020 --> 06:58:23.100
Do I have a second?

06:58:23.100 --> 06:58:24.260

06:58:24.260 --> 06:58:25.780
Thank you very much.

06:58:25.780 --> 06:58:27.700
I will now hold a roll call vote.

06:59:00.220 --> 06:59:01.060
It's approved.

06:59:02.300 --> 06:59:03.580
All right.

06:59:03.580 --> 06:59:05.940
Can we please ask Patricia

06:59:05.940 --> 06:59:08.460
to let member Son return to the meeting?

06:59:10.500 --> 06:59:13.100
And as soon as she has, we will continue.

06:59:17.380 --> 06:59:18.540
All right.

06:59:18.540 --> 06:59:21.260
I see that we have all of our members,

06:59:21.260 --> 06:59:24.220
including member Son, member Strauss,

06:59:24.220 --> 06:59:25.940
and member Glover Woods.

06:59:25.940 --> 06:59:29.380
So we are reopening item one

06:59:29.380 --> 06:59:31.420
to take action on the preliminary report

06:59:31.420 --> 06:59:36.140
of actions draft November 2020 meeting minutes

06:59:36.140 --> 06:59:38.980
to take up the SBE screening committee recommendations

06:59:38.980 --> 06:59:41.940
for appointments to the ACCS

06:59:41.940 --> 06:59:44.180
and report on our liaison assignments.

06:59:45.020 --> 06:59:50.020
So the first is the state board draft preliminary report

06:59:50.940 --> 06:59:55.940
of actions minutes for the November 5th, 6th, 2020 meeting.

06:59:56.700 --> 06:59:58.620
While we're waiting for any members of the public

06:59:58.620 --> 07:00:01.260
to call in, we have a motion from a board member

07:00:01.260 --> 07:00:06.260
to approve the minutes from November 5th and 6th.

07:00:08.140 --> 07:00:09.940
I'll move approval of the minutes.

07:00:11.060 --> 07:00:11.900
All right.

07:00:11.900 --> 07:00:13.220
Do I have a second?

07:00:13.220 --> 07:00:14.380

07:00:14.380 --> 07:00:15.500

Are there any public comments?

07:00:19.540 --> 07:00:21.060
There is nobody in the queue

07:00:21.060 --> 07:00:23.020
for public comments for item 15.

07:00:24.140 --> 07:00:25.820
All right.

07:00:25.820 --> 07:00:27.340
Any further discussion?

07:00:28.780 --> 07:00:30.220
Board members, please raise your hand

07:00:30.220 --> 07:00:35.220
in the participant panel of Zoom if you have a question.

07:00:35.820 --> 07:00:39.660
I see one from member Rucker, is your hand up?

07:00:39.660 --> 07:00:40.500

07:00:40.500 --> 07:00:42.340
Okay.

07:00:42.340 --> 07:00:44.660

07:01:20.180 --> 07:01:21.540
All right.

07:01:21.540 --> 07:01:24.060
I'm now going to ask Vice President Strauss

07:01:24.060 --> 07:01:26.860
as Chair of the State Board Screening Committee

07:01:26.860 --> 07:01:29.180
to present the committee's recommendations

07:01:29.180 --> 07:01:32.820
for service on the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools.

07:01:32.820 --> 07:01:36.100
And while we are waiting for any members of the public

07:01:36.100 --> 07:01:38.820
to call in, I have a motion from a board member

07:01:38.820 --> 07:01:42.220
to approve the screening committee recommendations

07:01:42.220 --> 07:01:44.260
for appointments to the ACCS.

07:01:45.180 --> 07:01:49.340
So let me just say thank you to Member Sung

07:01:49.340 --> 07:01:52.540
and Member Glover Woods for an amazing service

07:01:52.540 --> 07:01:54.980
as screening committee members this year.

07:01:54.980 --> 07:01:56.100
We had a lot to do.

07:01:56.100 --> 07:01:58.100
You guys were great team members.

07:01:58.100 --> 07:02:01.740
And we were supported by State Board and CDE staff

07:02:01.740 --> 07:02:03.540
through all of our processes.

07:02:03.540 --> 07:02:04.980
So to the whole team.

07:02:04.980 --> 07:02:09.980
So we met to screen for a member to ACCS

07:02:11.220 --> 07:02:13.300
for representing charter schools.

07:02:13.300 --> 07:02:16.500
So the screening committee is recommending Matt Taylor,

currently is Superintendent of River Charter Schools.

07:02:20.500 --> 07:02:24.060
And this will be for a two-year term from January, 2021

07:02:24.060 --> 07:02:26.700
to end of December, 2022.

07:02:26.700 --> 07:02:30.060
We are also recommending a new Chair of ACCS.

07:02:30.060 --> 07:02:32.620
We are recommending Mike Walsh,

07:02:32.620 --> 07:02:37.500
who is a trustee for Butte County Office of Education.

07:02:37.500 --> 07:02:40.420
And he represents the governing boards of school districts.

07:02:40.420 --> 07:02:42.620
And we're recommending him as our new Chair.

07:02:43.900 --> 07:02:45.540
Thank you.

07:02:45.540 --> 07:02:49.660
And do we have any public comment?

07:02:50.780 --> 07:02:53.740
No, there's nobody signed up for public comment.

07:02:53.740 --> 07:02:57.140
All right, do we have a motion on the recommendations?

07:03:00.780 --> 07:03:01.940
I'll move.

07:03:01.940 --> 07:03:03.540

Is there any further discussion?

07:03:12.780 --> 07:03:17.380
All right, I don't see any hands raised.

07:03:17.380 --> 07:03:20.060

So we're gonna go to the board member liaison reports

07:04:02.860 --> 07:04:07.700
and I want to ask board members to report out succinctly

07:04:07.700 --> 07:04:10.260
on any liaison activities that are not related

07:04:10.260 --> 07:04:13.180
to any items on our January agenda.

07:04:13.180 --> 07:04:14.980
And because we're doing everything

07:04:14.980 --> 07:04:17.140
in reverse alphabetical order today,

07:04:17.140 --> 07:04:19.740
I'm gonna start with member Son.

07:04:19.740 --> 07:04:21.580
I think he must be liking getting used

07:04:21.580 --> 07:04:23.060
to being the first in line.

07:04:23.060 --> 07:04:25.580
Yeah, I have to pay attention.

07:04:25.580 --> 07:04:26.420
I know.

07:04:27.820 --> 07:04:30.140
So yeah, so thank you very much.

07:04:30.140 --> 07:04:34.420
The California Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory Committee

07:04:34.420 --> 07:04:39.260
is meeting later this month on the 29th of January.

07:04:39.260 --> 07:04:43.060
And we just continue our work in the implementation

07:04:43.060 --> 07:04:46.660
of the Perkins Plan and lots of conversations

07:04:46.660 --> 07:04:51.340
around a state plan for career technical education

07:04:51.340 --> 07:04:56.340
and in the measurements for how we look

07:04:57.060 --> 07:05:01.500
at quality career technical education programs in the state.

07:05:04.740 --> 07:05:07.340
Great, that was very succinct, well modeled.

07:05:08.700 --> 07:05:10.220
Vice President Strauss.

07:05:10.220 --> 07:05:11.500
High standard.

07:05:11.500 --> 07:05:14.620
So I'm a member of the advisory board

07:05:14.620 --> 07:05:16.380
for the Center for Advancement of Instruction

07:05:16.380 --> 07:05:17.460
and Quantitative Reasoning.

07:05:17.460 --> 07:05:21.540
It's a CSU, based at CSU to collaborate

07:05:21.540 --> 07:05:25.380
with school districts to look at a fourth year of math

07:05:25.380 --> 07:05:28.500
that would help students be ready for math in college.

07:05:28.500 --> 07:05:30.140
And I just have to say, they're very thoughtful

07:05:30.140 --> 07:05:32.180
about the quantitative reasoning.

07:05:32.180 --> 07:05:34.460
They have a collaboration with a lot of leaders

07:05:34.460 --> 07:05:36.820
and continue to look at pilot projects

07:05:36.820 --> 07:05:38.820
that are actually preparing students

07:05:38.820 --> 07:05:43.620
after algebra two or integrated three for a fourth year,

07:05:43.620 --> 07:05:45.980
not necessarily calculus, pre-calculus

07:05:45.980 --> 07:05:47.300
to keep kids ready for college.

07:05:47.300 --> 07:05:49.060
We'll hear more about this, I'm sure,

07:05:49.060 --> 07:05:50.340
in the math framework discussion

07:05:50.340 --> 07:05:51.500
about how to prepare students,

07:05:51.500 --> 07:05:54.180
but I just wanna thank them for continuing

07:05:54.180 --> 07:05:55.580
to collaborate with districts

07:05:55.580 --> 07:05:58.540
to try to give students the support in mathematics.

07:05:58.540 --> 07:06:01.580
And the IQC met on November 18th and 19th

07:06:01.580 --> 07:06:03.140
on ethnic studies.

07:06:03.140 --> 07:06:06.820
Member Glover Woods and member Rucker were with us

07:06:06.820 --> 07:06:08.340
for two days on this process.

07:06:08.340 --> 07:06:11.460
And the draft is now,

07:06:11.460 --> 07:06:13.140
ethnic studies model curriculum is out

07:06:13.140 --> 07:06:17.700
for 45 day public comment period, it's almost over.

07:06:17.700 --> 07:06:22.220
There were 57,000 public comments during the process

07:06:22.220 --> 07:06:25.900
and it resulted in more than 240 edits.

07:06:25.900 --> 07:06:28.740
So very thoughtful public comment

07:06:28.740 --> 07:06:31.100
and worked by the instructional quality commission.

07:06:31.100 --> 07:06:33.420
And I believe my colleagues may have a little bit more

07:06:33.420 --> 07:06:34.460
to say about that process.

07:06:34.460 --> 07:06:37.300
That'll be coming to us in March.

07:06:37.300 --> 07:06:39.540
The California Collaborative for District Reform,

07:06:39.540 --> 07:06:41.980
which is a group of districts and state leaders

07:06:41.980 --> 07:06:45.700
and researchers who meet three times a year,

07:06:45.700 --> 07:06:48.820
met December 2nd and 3rd on the issue of race,

07:06:48.860 --> 07:06:52.500
equity and COVID-19 navigating the crisis

07:06:52.500 --> 07:06:55.980
and building for the future, highly relevant.

07:06:55.980 --> 07:06:59.140
I have to say we heard student voice as a panel

07:06:59.140 --> 07:07:01.300
to help inform our practice.

07:07:01.300 --> 07:07:03.500
And I can't say enough about how important it is

07:07:03.500 --> 07:07:05.340
that we listen to what students are telling us

07:07:05.340 --> 07:07:08.260
about their experiences during remote learning.

07:07:08.260 --> 07:07:12.180
It was impactful and really helped to,

07:07:12.180 --> 07:07:15.260
we had a panel for parents and community on priorities

07:07:15.260 --> 07:07:17.260
and then also district leaders just talking

07:07:17.260 --> 07:07:19.340
about the urgency and listening.

07:07:19.340 --> 07:07:23.260
So I think we all talked about what member Darling-Hammond

07:07:23.260 --> 07:07:25.660
started today's conversation at the board about,

07:07:25.660 --> 07:07:29.940
which is we have to improve the outcomes in our system

07:07:29.940 --> 07:07:32.220
and we can't go back the way we were

07:07:32.220 --> 07:07:34.380
before we left to remote learning.

07:07:34.380 --> 07:07:38.580
So anyway, to the districts that are continuing to advise

07:07:38.580 --> 07:07:41.500
and impact this work was really impactful.

07:07:42.940 --> 07:07:46.380
See, and then we are a member of that NASB,

07:07:46.380 --> 07:07:50.180
the National Association of State Boards of Education.

07:07:50.180 --> 07:07:55.180
And they had a presentation by the CDC last week.

07:07:55.300 --> 07:07:57.940
And just let me just say that there are a bunch

07:07:57.940 --> 07:08:00.740
of resources, NASB has guidelines

07:08:00.740 --> 07:08:02.540
on thinking about civics education,

07:08:02.540 --> 07:08:04.980
a lot that we've been involved with through,

07:08:04.980 --> 07:08:06.900
remember Patio Bronson as our liaison

07:08:06.900 --> 07:08:09.500
and also our civic engagement work.

07:08:09.500 --> 07:08:13.580
But they did, the CDC did share some valuable resources.

07:08:13.620 --> 07:08:16.580
I just wanna highlight to look at their website

07:08:16.580 --> 07:08:21.060
if you're interested on tools for a healthy new year,

07:08:21.060 --> 07:08:22.780
how to clean and disinfect schools,

07:08:22.780 --> 07:08:26.060
how to monitor and evaluate tools and resources,

07:08:26.060 --> 07:08:28.500
interview and focus guide resources,

07:08:29.540 --> 07:08:32.500
updates for quarantine.

07:08:32.500 --> 07:08:35.380
So again, huge amount of resources at CDC.

07:08:35.380 --> 07:08:38.500
I know our staff is involved with them regularly,

07:08:38.500 --> 07:08:40.460
if not every day, but I just think

07:08:40.460 --> 07:08:42.860
for school district leaders important

07:08:42.860 --> 07:08:45.980
and staff to know that that's an important resource as well.

07:08:45.980 --> 07:08:48.940
And then our concurrence commission is my last comment,

07:08:48.940 --> 07:08:52.380
as our subject matter project was supposed to meet,

07:08:52.380 --> 07:08:55.060
is going to meet later this month to talk about an update

07:08:55.060 --> 07:08:57.420
on where the subject matter projects are working.

07:08:57.420 --> 07:08:59.140
As you heard, they're informing the project

07:08:59.140 --> 07:09:01.140
that we started with earlier in the day

07:09:01.140 --> 07:09:03.660
and they are important partners in our work.

07:09:03.660 --> 07:09:05.660
So that'll be coming up later this month.

07:09:05.660 --> 07:09:06.700
Thank you very much.

07:09:07.660 --> 07:09:08.500
Great.

07:09:09.500 --> 07:09:10.340
Member Fatah.

07:09:11.620 --> 07:09:12.940
I'm sorry, I got out of order.

07:09:12.940 --> 07:09:16.500
Member Ruckers next in the reverse alphabetical order.

07:09:16.500 --> 07:09:17.820
Okay, thank you.

07:09:17.820 --> 07:09:19.420
First of all, I'd like to begin by thanking

07:09:19.420 --> 07:09:22.500
Board Member Sun for reporting on the work

07:09:22.500 --> 07:09:23.540
that's being undertaken

07:09:23.540 --> 07:09:27.540
by the California Workforce Joint Advisory Pathway.

07:09:27.540 --> 07:09:29.700
I'm sure I got that acronym all wrong,

07:09:29.700 --> 07:09:31.620
but you know which one I'm talking about,

07:09:31.620 --> 07:09:33.260
Board Member Sun.

07:09:33.260 --> 07:09:35.180
The work that I do wanna point out

07:09:35.180 --> 07:09:37.660
that one of the most important functions

07:09:37.780 --> 07:09:40.980
that the staff and this panel have undertaken

07:09:40.980 --> 07:09:43.860
is to do an evaluation of the metrics

07:09:43.860 --> 07:09:48.260
that we have adopted to evaluate the state plan.

07:09:48.260 --> 07:09:50.940
And I think that the learning pain

07:09:50.940 --> 07:09:55.260
and the growing pain that they have dealt with

07:09:55.260 --> 07:09:57.380
in trying to do this work

07:09:57.380 --> 07:09:59.460
is something that could be helpful to us

07:09:59.460 --> 07:10:01.700
in the matters that we spoke about

07:10:01.700 --> 07:10:04.020
concerning the state literacy plan.

07:10:04.020 --> 07:10:06.700
Because we really are tasking ourselves to ask,

07:10:06.700 --> 07:10:08.660
are the metrics we've chosen

07:10:08.660 --> 07:10:12.220
to giving us information about the function of the program

07:10:12.220 --> 07:10:13.900
in the way we intended.

07:10:13.900 --> 07:10:16.620
I wanna thank Board Member Strauss

07:10:16.620 --> 07:10:19.820
for her reporting about the work of the IQC.

07:10:19.820 --> 07:10:22.860
The IQC has undertaken a lot of very controversial

07:10:22.860 --> 07:10:24.060
and important work,

07:10:24.060 --> 07:10:27.220
and we'll continue supporting them through that work.

07:10:27.220 --> 07:10:30.220
And I also wanna thank Dr. Jo Bowler

07:10:30.220 --> 07:10:33.180
for her overview about the work that's been going on

07:10:33.180 --> 07:10:35.500
with the mathematics framework,

07:10:35.500 --> 07:10:38.220
because that satisfies my entire presentation

07:10:38.220 --> 07:10:41.060
or discussion about what I was gonna share

07:10:41.060 --> 07:10:43.380
about what's been going on with the math framework.

07:10:43.380 --> 07:10:46.420
I'm very excited to be able to present that framework

07:10:46.420 --> 07:10:48.900
eventually to my colleagues on the board.

07:10:48.900 --> 07:10:51.540
Finally, I would like to close by saying,

07:10:51.540 --> 07:10:53.940
I'm also a part of a study group

07:10:53.940 --> 07:10:56.020
that's being sponsored by NASB,

07:10:56.020 --> 07:10:59.620
the National Association of State Boards of Education,

07:10:59.620 --> 07:11:02.340
concerning educating the whole child.

07:11:02.340 --> 07:11:04.020
They have really turned their attention

07:11:04.020 --> 07:11:06.420
to the impact of COVID in school closures

07:11:06.420 --> 07:11:08.700
and our alternative learning environment.

07:11:08.700 --> 07:11:12.340
They have a wealth of resources that have been provided

07:11:12.340 --> 07:11:16.220
to states and state boards of education to guide this work.

07:11:16.220 --> 07:11:18.740
And I believe a lot of what they have done

07:11:18.740 --> 07:11:22.420
has informed the conversations that we saw presented

07:11:22.420 --> 07:11:25.420
to us today during the discussions

07:11:25.420 --> 07:11:27.860
about the distance learning framework.

07:11:27.860 --> 07:11:31.540
But I also would like to encourage my colleagues

07:11:31.540 --> 07:11:34.900
who also take a look at the other resources

07:11:34.900 --> 07:11:36.620
that they are providing.

07:11:36.620 --> 07:11:39.020
It's been an interesting work group panel

07:11:39.020 --> 07:11:41.300
and interesting work group activity.

07:11:41.300 --> 07:11:43.900
My next meeting is coming up in February.

07:11:45.380 --> 07:11:49.140
All right, member Rodriguez.

07:11:49.140 --> 07:11:50.100
Yes, hello everyone.

07:11:50.100 --> 07:11:52.220
I'll try to make this quick.

07:11:52.220 --> 07:11:53.860
So as you saw in the consent item,

07:11:53.860 --> 07:11:57.900
the arts instructional materials adoption is moving along.

07:11:57.940 --> 07:12:00.300
February, we'll know how many publishers

07:12:00.300 --> 07:12:01.900
plan to participate.

07:12:01.900 --> 07:12:04.500
Reviewer trainings will take place in April.

07:12:04.500 --> 07:12:07.780
We're looking forward to having new instructional materials

07:12:07.780 --> 07:12:11.860
for arts since 2006.

07:12:11.860 --> 07:12:16.860
CTC met on December 3rd and 4th

07:12:17.060 --> 07:12:20.020
and there was actually a special meeting the day before,

07:12:20.020 --> 07:12:23.020
strategic planning workshop session,

07:12:23.020 --> 07:12:27.220
which involved examining a lot of the goals

07:12:27.220 --> 07:12:32.220
for 2020 and looking at how to develop

07:12:32.500 --> 07:12:34.140
the strategic plan for 2021.

07:12:35.580 --> 07:12:40.420
Some of the trends were around anti-bias and racial justice,

07:12:40.420 --> 07:12:45.420
COVID-19 impact, preparation for virtual learning settings

07:12:45.780 --> 07:12:47.420
and technology use.

07:12:48.420 --> 07:12:50.860
And so there was a lot of constructive feedback

07:12:50.860 --> 07:12:54.620
and it's important to note that the CTC has,

07:12:55.500 --> 07:12:58.860
it's purview established and a lot of the comments

07:12:58.860 --> 07:13:03.340
were actually not related to the responsibilities of the CTC.

07:13:03.340 --> 07:13:08.340
Those were addressed, but definitely very favorable.

07:13:09.820 --> 07:13:13.100
The stakeholders really appreciated the direction.

07:13:13.100 --> 07:13:18.100
So moving on to the regular meeting,

07:13:18.460 --> 07:13:21.140
as schools remained closed,

07:13:21.180 --> 07:13:24.740
one of the concerns is that candidates,

07:13:24.740 --> 07:13:27.820
teacher candidates and educator prep programs

07:13:27.820 --> 07:13:29.740
who began their clinical practice this year

07:13:29.740 --> 07:13:31.500
in a distance learning model,

07:13:31.500 --> 07:13:33.700
might not have the opportunity

07:13:33.700 --> 07:13:35.660
to do the supervised clinical practice

07:13:35.660 --> 07:13:36.980
in a face-to-face setting.

07:13:38.740 --> 07:13:41.580
There exists some concern that they may not develop

07:13:41.580 --> 07:13:46.580
certain skills that are key to good teaching

07:13:47.460 --> 07:13:50.380
like the strong classroom management skills

07:13:50.380 --> 07:13:52.740
or positive student engagement.

07:13:52.740 --> 07:13:55.140
However, we did hear from some of our stakeholders

07:13:55.140 --> 07:13:58.140
who said that they're engaging,

07:13:58.140 --> 07:14:02.140
they're being very resourceful and forward thinking

07:14:03.140 --> 07:14:06.260
in the ways that they are working with the students.

07:14:06.260 --> 07:14:08.940
So these were some of the comments,

07:14:08.940 --> 07:14:13.940
but it turns out that the student teachers actually said,

07:14:14.340 --> 07:14:17.660
no, we're being very creative

07:14:17.660 --> 07:14:20.300
in the way we're working with this.

07:14:21.220 --> 07:14:22.500
The critical role of induction,

07:14:23.940 --> 07:14:26.860
providing teachers with support and coaching,

07:14:26.860 --> 07:14:29.460
including a focus on teaching in the classroom.

07:14:29.460 --> 07:14:32.260
It's imperative to clarify the roles

07:14:32.260 --> 07:14:34.780
between site administrators, especially once we go back,

07:14:34.780 --> 07:14:36.940
mentors, preliminary programs,

07:14:36.940 --> 07:14:40.220
how we can ensure the success for the new teachers

07:14:41.100 --> 07:14:43.420
and with the onboarding processes.

07:14:43.420 --> 07:14:46.180
So this is gonna have an impact on the employers

07:14:46.180 --> 07:14:47.700
because they're going to need to tailor

07:14:47.700 --> 07:14:51.900
some of their onboarding for the new educators

07:14:51.900 --> 07:14:54.460
who haven't had that in-person training, right?

07:14:54.460 --> 07:14:56.780
So that creates like another dilemma

07:14:56.780 --> 07:14:59.580
for the onsite administrators.

07:15:00.700 --> 07:15:02.540
They're gonna have some challenges

07:15:02.540 --> 07:15:05.540
once we go back to in-person instruction.

07:15:06.740 --> 07:15:08.420
I'm speeding through this, it's a lot more,

07:15:08.420 --> 07:15:10.380
but I'm like being very succinct.

07:15:11.340 --> 07:15:16.340
The commission has engaged in a multi-year effort

07:15:17.860 --> 07:15:21.340
to address the changes in which students with disabilities

07:15:21.340 --> 07:15:23.140
are served in California schools.

07:15:24.700 --> 07:15:27.100
This resulted in the reorganization

07:15:27.100 --> 07:15:30.980
of seven special ed credentials into five essentials.

07:15:31.780 --> 07:15:35.500
And the commission approved three pathways

07:15:35.500 --> 07:15:37.620
to earning updated credentials.

07:15:37.620 --> 07:15:40.740
Coursework through commission approved

07:15:40.740 --> 07:15:43.260
preliminary special ed program,

07:15:43.260 --> 07:15:45.620
professional development approved

07:15:47.660 --> 07:15:51.140
by the local planning area or educational agencies

07:15:51.140 --> 07:15:53.500
and demonstration of prior knowledge

07:15:53.500 --> 07:15:55.140
via observational data,

07:15:55.140 --> 07:15:57.780
a portfolio submission, video demonstration.

07:15:59.300 --> 07:16:02.660
Educators will be allowed to utilize all three methods,

07:16:02.660 --> 07:16:04.660
but no educator will be required

07:16:04.660 --> 07:16:06.420
to apply for a bridge credential.

07:16:07.820 --> 07:16:10.100
With existing special ed credentials,

07:16:10.100 --> 07:16:12.260
they'll be able to continue to,

07:16:12.260 --> 07:16:14.820
they're authorized to teach any content

07:16:15.740 --> 07:16:18.100
that their credential currently authorizes.

07:16:19.540 --> 07:16:21.740
And let's see here,

07:16:21.740 --> 07:16:25.620
I wanted to get to the teacher residency grant programs.

07:16:25.620 --> 07:16:29.420
The result from the initial evaluation of the first year

07:16:29.420 --> 07:16:31.620
for the residency program showed many partnerships

07:16:31.620 --> 07:16:33.700
are beginning to make progress

07:16:33.700 --> 07:16:36.540
toward increasing the number of teachers in shortage areas,

07:16:36.540 --> 07:16:39.140
special ed, STEM, and bilingual,

07:16:39.140 --> 07:16:42.260
as well as the proportion of teachers of color.

07:16:42.260 --> 07:16:44.780
And lastly, this goes to one of the reports

07:16:44.780 --> 07:16:46.940
that we heard at the beginning of the meeting,

07:16:48.060 --> 07:16:51.460
parent and family engagement and pre-service preparation.

07:16:51.460 --> 07:16:54.420
The CTC was updated on the collaborative work

07:16:54.420 --> 07:16:56.940
that has taken place between public advocates,

07:16:56.940 --> 07:17:01.940
SDSU and CTC staff and the parent organization network

07:17:02.060 --> 07:17:05.380
on the multi-state effort related to family engagement

07:17:05.380 --> 07:17:08.380
for teacher and administrator candidates.

07:17:08.380 --> 07:17:11.340
And so they provided a great report

07:17:12.380 --> 07:17:15.780
and it has, the initiative has two key outcomes,

07:17:15.780 --> 07:17:17.980
institutions of higher ed, state agencies,

07:17:17.980 --> 07:17:20.780
and key stakeholder groups will address family,

07:17:20.780 --> 07:17:23.300
school, and community engagement

07:17:23.300 --> 07:17:25.380
in meaningful and effective ways.

07:17:26.580 --> 07:17:28.260
And educators and administrators

07:17:28.260 --> 07:17:31.340
will effectively put in place teaching practices,

07:17:31.340 --> 07:17:34.300
organizational infrastructure, and policies

07:17:34.300 --> 07:17:37.820
that create meaningful opportunities for families

07:17:37.820 --> 07:17:40.100
to engage their children's in education.

07:17:41.140 --> 07:17:42.580
Thank you.

07:17:42.580 --> 07:17:44.500
Terrific, thank you.

07:17:44.500 --> 07:17:46.100
Member Patio Bronson.

07:17:47.860 --> 07:17:50.940
Okay, so I have three items.

07:17:50.940 --> 07:17:52.900
One is that on December 1st,

07:17:52.900 --> 07:17:56.180
the master plan for early learning and care was released,

07:17:56.180 --> 07:18:01.180
which is an exciting blueprint for the next 10 years

07:18:01.260 --> 07:18:04.500
to address how zero to five year olds

07:18:04.500 --> 07:18:07.540
should properly develop, be supported in their development

07:18:07.540 --> 07:18:10.340
and should be school ready

07:18:10.340 --> 07:18:12.860
as they enter into the K to 12 system.

07:18:14.740 --> 07:18:17.300
Of relevance, particularly for this board,

07:18:17.300 --> 07:18:21.060
there is a recommendation around

07:18:21.060 --> 07:18:23.860
growing the transitional kindergarten program,

07:18:23.860 --> 07:18:27.980
which is already administered and overseen by LEAs,

07:18:28.860 --> 07:18:32.220
as well as the idea of having at least two years

07:18:32.220 --> 07:18:36.340
of preschool for low income three and four year olds.

07:18:36.340 --> 07:18:39.380
There's also a component where for the first time,

07:18:39.380 --> 07:18:41.380
the early learning programs would be applying

07:18:41.380 --> 07:18:44.700
the model of LCFF of targeting

07:18:44.700 --> 07:18:47.380
based on low income students foster youth

07:18:47.380 --> 07:18:48.580
and English language learners,

07:18:48.580 --> 07:18:50.460
which is a great bit of coherence

07:18:50.460 --> 07:18:52.860
to bring between the two systems.

07:18:52.860 --> 07:18:56.260
And special thanks to board president Darling Hammond

07:18:56.260 --> 07:19:01.180
for all of the wisdom and insight and also cat herding

07:19:01.180 --> 07:19:04.380
that she undertook to make this all happen.

07:19:04.380 --> 07:19:07.260
And it's really, it's the first time that California

07:19:07.260 --> 07:19:10.900
has actually brought these two system leaders together

07:19:10.900 --> 07:19:14.220
and actually articulated path for California

07:19:14.220 --> 07:19:16.740
to think about how to get ahead of so many of the challenges

07:19:16.740 --> 07:19:18.500
so that there's less remediation

07:19:18.500 --> 07:19:21.340
and more of a focus on prevention in the early years.

07:19:22.340 --> 07:19:27.060
In addition, there was a tour of San Diego Unified's

07:19:27.060 --> 07:19:28.580
transitional kindergarten program,

07:19:28.580 --> 07:19:31.980
which has piloted a number of innovations,

07:19:31.980 --> 07:19:33.780
public private partnerships,

07:19:33.780 --> 07:19:37.060
focus around transition and articulation

07:19:37.060 --> 07:19:41.140
between preschool TK and the K to three

07:19:41.140 --> 07:19:43.100
early literacy pipeline,

07:19:43.100 --> 07:19:46.060
which was attended by several members of the legislature,

07:19:46.060 --> 07:19:49.820
as well as agency heads within the department of ed,

07:19:49.900 --> 07:19:52.300
as well as the department of social services

07:19:52.300 --> 07:19:56.580
where the younger children programs are overseen.

07:19:56.580 --> 07:19:59.660
And then lastly, I wanna say a special thank you

07:19:59.660 --> 07:20:02.580
to all of the government and civics teachers

07:20:02.580 --> 07:20:05.340
across the state who have on the fly

07:20:05.340 --> 07:20:07.980
had to absorb quite a lot

07:20:07.980 --> 07:20:12.860
and talk to 6 million school children across the state

07:20:12.860 --> 07:20:15.540
about what unfolded in our capital.

07:20:15.540 --> 07:20:18.780
So I offer special thanks to all of the teachers

07:20:18.780 --> 07:20:23.780
who are talking through what the electoral college means

07:20:25.100 --> 07:20:28.580
of why it's relevant to actually honor the vote,

07:20:28.580 --> 07:20:31.460
the difference between peaceful first amendment,

07:20:31.460 --> 07:20:33.500
protest and violence,

07:20:33.500 --> 07:20:37.220
and actually bringing these conversations

07:20:37.220 --> 07:20:40.420
into the classroom in a way that our students

07:20:40.420 --> 07:20:44.020
can actually grapple with what is history unfolding,

07:20:44.020 --> 07:20:45.740
but also very teachable moments.

07:20:46.580 --> 07:20:48.740
Thank you for here.

07:20:50.380 --> 07:20:51.300
Member Navo.

07:20:52.300 --> 07:20:55.500
I had a number of highlights, I'm gonna highlight one.

07:20:55.500 --> 07:20:59.580
Obviously, the CCE continues to work in collaboration

07:20:59.580 --> 07:21:02.420
with the city and county offices and geo leads

07:21:02.420 --> 07:21:05.020
in building and supporting the field

07:21:05.020 --> 07:21:05.980
with a number of issues

07:21:05.980 --> 07:21:08.100
that our communities and students are facing.

07:21:08.100 --> 07:21:11.260
One highlight in particular is the leading forward series

07:21:11.260 --> 07:21:14.260
that launches on January 25th.

07:21:14.260 --> 07:21:17.980
It features free on-demand keynotes and courses and tools,

07:21:17.980 --> 07:21:20.660
and it's primarily focused on resources

07:21:20.660 --> 07:21:23.500
that are designed to meet the learning loss mitigation needs

07:21:23.500 --> 07:21:26.260
and underserved students and communities.

07:21:26.260 --> 07:21:27.820
And it focuses on five areas

07:21:27.820 --> 07:21:29.340
that I think will be helpful to the field,

07:21:29.340 --> 07:21:33.380
systems leadership, thriving socio and economically,

07:21:33.380 --> 07:21:35.820
advancing equity formative assessments

07:21:35.820 --> 07:21:37.620
and responsive teaching and learning.

07:21:38.540 --> 07:21:41.300
A lot of information that is being done in collaboration

07:21:41.300 --> 07:21:43.780
can be found on the CCE website.

07:21:43.780 --> 07:21:46.620
I would encourage people to access that

07:21:46.620 --> 07:21:48.820
to get the information that they need.

07:21:48.820 --> 07:21:51.060
But that particular highlight is one

07:21:51.060 --> 07:21:52.700
that is fairly important

07:21:52.700 --> 07:21:54.500
and will be very helpful to the field.

07:21:57.100 --> 07:21:57.940
Thank you.

07:21:59.580 --> 07:22:00.620
Member McQuillan.

07:22:02.780 --> 07:22:05.060
All right, not a whole lot to report.

07:22:06.500 --> 07:22:08.940
I'm looking forward to the revised date

07:22:08.940 --> 07:22:13.500
on the California Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory Committee.

07:22:14.420 --> 07:22:16.620
On the 29th, I look forward to that.

07:22:17.500 --> 07:22:21.380
Some of the recent round table discussions

07:22:21.380 --> 07:22:23.700
that our state superintendent has had

07:22:23.700 --> 07:22:28.700
has sparked the interest to have other round table discussions

07:22:29.180 --> 07:22:32.060
here in the North State on ethnic studies

07:22:32.060 --> 07:22:34.140
and Native American studies.

07:22:34.140 --> 07:22:38.100
So I'll be participating in a couple of those

07:22:38.100 --> 07:22:40.380
coming up in the near future.

07:22:40.380 --> 07:22:43.460
And it's sparking a lot of good dialogue

07:22:44.020 --> 07:22:46.540
of how to assist our students,

07:22:46.540 --> 07:22:47.900
our Native American students

07:22:47.900 --> 07:22:50.780
and underrepresented students

07:22:50.780 --> 07:22:54.500
in here in extreme Northern California.

07:22:54.500 --> 07:22:55.980
So I'm looking forward to that.

07:22:57.540 --> 07:22:59.660
And that's all I have, thank you.

07:22:59.660 --> 07:23:00.980
That's great.

07:23:00.980 --> 07:23:03.420
I hope we'll be seeing more and more of that

07:23:03.420 --> 07:23:07.660
as the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum comes to us in March

07:23:07.660 --> 07:23:10.420
as the resources roll out

07:23:10.420 --> 07:23:13.340
for supporting that kind of professional learning.

07:23:14.220 --> 07:23:15.740
Member Glover-Woods.

07:23:15.740 --> 07:23:17.500
Thank you, and I'll kind of build off of that

07:23:17.500 --> 07:23:19.540
regarding the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum

07:23:19.540 --> 07:23:21.180
just to kind of piggyback on

07:23:21.180 --> 07:23:22.860
Vice President Strauss' comments.

07:23:24.540 --> 07:23:28.220
The comment period for this last draft

07:23:28.220 --> 07:23:31.060
that's currently there is open right now.

07:23:31.060 --> 07:23:33.180
It will end on January 21st.

07:23:33.180 --> 07:23:36.420
And as I'm sure many of you guys know,

07:23:36.420 --> 07:23:38.860
we'll anticipate the CDE recommendations

07:23:38.860 --> 07:23:41.180
coming to the Board in March.

07:23:41.180 --> 07:23:43.420
So we're quite excited about that.

07:23:43.420 --> 07:23:45.220
And as it relates to world languages,

07:23:45.220 --> 07:23:48.060
we just approved the reviewers.

07:23:48.060 --> 07:23:49.620
So just to let you know some of the work

07:23:49.620 --> 07:23:51.740
that's gonna take place over the spring.

07:23:52.780 --> 07:23:56.020
In February, we'll have an idea of how many publishers

07:23:56.020 --> 07:23:59.260
are wanting to participate in the adoption process.

07:23:59.260 --> 07:24:03.180
And then in April, the reviewer trainings will take place

07:24:03.180 --> 07:24:06.140
and the deliberations will take place in July.

07:24:06.140 --> 07:24:08.300
Of course, everything will be held virtually,

07:24:08.300 --> 07:24:12.100
but we're excited that we will have some materials

07:24:12.100 --> 07:24:15.420
for world language coming up fairly soon.

07:24:15.420 --> 07:24:18.740
Lastly, I would like to share that I did have an opportunity

07:24:18.740 --> 07:24:22.380
to participate in the Education Commission

07:24:22.380 --> 07:24:26.300
of the State's Early STEM Policy Academy.

07:24:26.300 --> 07:24:29.980
I was with Dr. Stephanie Grayson from CDE,

07:24:29.980 --> 07:24:31.660
then Stuart from Children Now,

07:24:31.660 --> 07:24:34.140
and some other great colleagues across the state

07:24:34.140 --> 07:24:37.380
to talk about what STEM instruction

07:24:37.420 --> 07:24:40.620
can and should look like for our younger learners.

07:24:40.620 --> 07:24:44.500
And it was quite a robust conversation with other states,

07:24:44.500 --> 07:24:47.140
as well as internally with California.

07:24:47.140 --> 07:24:49.660
And I will stop my comments right there.

07:24:49.660 --> 07:24:50.500
Thank you.

07:24:51.340 --> 07:24:52.180
Thank you.

07:24:52.180 --> 07:24:53.020
Member Fatah.

07:24:54.220 --> 07:24:55.460
Thank you, President Darling-Khan.

07:24:55.460 --> 07:24:58.580
And I'd just like to say that my liaison kind of tasks

07:24:58.580 --> 07:25:01.380
have been really centered around following up

07:25:01.380 --> 07:25:03.940
from the presentations that we heard back in November

07:25:03.940 --> 07:25:06.820
from students at the Student Advisory Board on Education,

07:25:06.820 --> 07:25:09.460
hosted by the California Association of Student Councils.

07:25:09.460 --> 07:25:12.780
So CASCS, Governmental Affairs and Policy Director,

07:25:12.780 --> 07:25:16.140
and I have been kind of in conversation almost daily

07:25:16.140 --> 07:25:20.220
about how to get some of those proposals to legislators

07:25:20.220 --> 07:25:21.380
and in the hands of legislators

07:25:21.380 --> 07:25:24.380
before their bill packages are due in February.

07:25:24.380 --> 07:25:27.700
So one of the ones that we've been focusing on particularly

07:25:27.700 --> 07:25:30.180
has been regarding student board members,

07:25:30.180 --> 07:25:31.220
student board member rights,

07:25:31.220 --> 07:25:36.220
and the potential creation of a Student Advisory Commission

07:25:36.460 --> 07:25:37.740
to the state board.

07:25:37.740 --> 07:25:39.380
And also another proposal

07:25:39.380 --> 07:25:44.260
that we're kind of really pushing forth with is one

07:25:44.260 --> 07:25:47.380
that kind of builds off the state school of civic engagement

07:25:47.380 --> 07:25:50.420
that we passed earlier last year

07:25:50.420 --> 07:25:53.340
to create a student civic learning book.

07:25:53.340 --> 07:25:55.140
And so next week I'm actually meeting

07:25:55.140 --> 07:25:59.020
with board members Navo and Executive Director Allen

07:25:59.020 --> 07:26:00.020
to discuss that.

07:26:00.020 --> 07:26:03.060
And I guess my final thing is that I recently joined

07:26:03.060 --> 07:26:05.360
the Cradle to Career Data Systems

07:26:05.400 --> 07:26:07.000
Community Engagement Subcommittee.

07:26:07.000 --> 07:26:09.000
And so that has its first meeting next week

07:26:09.000 --> 07:26:10.560
and I'm really excited about it.

07:26:11.520 --> 07:26:12.360
Great.

07:26:13.480 --> 07:26:14.560
I am next in the list

07:26:14.560 --> 07:26:16.480
and most of the things I've been working on

07:26:16.480 --> 07:26:18.000
have been discussed in this meeting,

07:26:18.000 --> 07:26:20.800
but I will just piggyback on the comments

07:26:20.800 --> 07:26:23.320
that Member Patio-Bronson made about the master plan

07:26:23.320 --> 07:26:28.320
and early learning that will set up, I think,

07:26:28.520 --> 07:26:33.120
a process that will bring much more to this board

07:26:33.120 --> 07:26:37.560
around the ways in which we think about universal pre-K

07:26:37.560 --> 07:26:42.560
and the ways in which those elements of the program unfold

07:26:43.120 --> 07:26:44.240
in our state.

07:26:44.240 --> 07:26:47.280
So that's something to look forward to.

07:26:47.280 --> 07:26:50.480
And I will pass the baton to Member Burr.

07:26:51.680 --> 07:26:53.040
Thank you.

07:26:53.040 --> 07:26:54.520
So two of my assignments

07:26:54.520 --> 07:26:56.720
are accountability and charter schools.

07:26:56.720 --> 07:26:59.280
You heard the accountability items this morning.

07:26:59.280 --> 07:27:00.720
A board member Ting and I,

07:27:00.760 --> 07:27:03.360
or Son and I have been spending a lot of time

07:27:03.360 --> 07:27:05.360
on charter school regulations,

07:27:05.360 --> 07:27:08.520
which as you know will be deferred to a later date,

07:27:08.520 --> 07:27:10.120
but stay tuned.

07:27:10.120 --> 07:27:10.960
Thank you.

07:27:12.200 --> 07:27:13.960
You leave us in suspense.

07:27:16.960 --> 07:27:20.480
Well, we're gonna move on to agenda item 15.

07:27:20.480 --> 07:27:23.520
We need the public comment slide to go up again,

07:27:23.520 --> 07:27:27.280
which is the moment for general public comment.

07:27:27.280 --> 07:27:28.680
I'm looking for that slide

07:27:29.600 --> 07:27:32.120
and it's looking like it's coming, here it goes.

07:27:34.040 --> 07:27:36.080
Public comment is invited on any matter

07:27:36.080 --> 07:27:39.120
that was not included on the printed agenda.

07:27:39.120 --> 07:27:43.720
And we will open the phone line for the public comment queue.

07:27:43.720 --> 07:27:45.680
Members of the public wishing to provide comment

07:27:45.680 --> 07:27:49.400
on this item may do so by calling the number on this slide

07:27:49.400 --> 07:27:51.320
and entering the access code.

07:27:52.560 --> 07:27:54.080
Are there any public comments?

07:27:55.840 --> 07:27:58.360
We do not have anybody signed up for public comment

07:27:59.040 --> 07:27:59.880
for item 15.

07:28:00.760 --> 07:28:02.320
Okay.

07:28:02.320 --> 07:28:07.320
I hereby end today's session at 5.16 PM

07:28:07.960 --> 07:28:11.760
and look forward to seeing you again at 8.30 tomorrow morning.

07:28:11.760 --> 07:28:13.320
Have a good evening, everyone.

07:28:15.040 --> 07:28:15.880
Thank you all.
