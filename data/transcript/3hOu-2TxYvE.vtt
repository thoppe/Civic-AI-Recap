00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Good morning, everyone. Welcome to day two of our March 2021 board meeting. We'll start

00:11.000 --> 00:17.240
by establishing a quorum. So Brooks, can you please call the roll?

00:17.240 --> 00:23.640
Member Sun. Present.

00:23.640 --> 00:27.840
Vice President Strauss. Here.

00:27.840 --> 00:32.840
Member Rucker. Member Rodriguez.

00:32.840 --> 00:37.840
Morning, here. Member Petillo-Brownson.

00:37.840 --> 00:42.840
Here. Good morning. Member Navo.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.840
Here. Member McQuillan.

00:45.840 --> 00:49.840
Here. Member Glover-Woods.

00:49.840 --> 00:54.840
Here. Member Patel.

00:54.840 --> 00:57.840
Here. Present. Darlin Hammond.

00:57.840 --> 01:04.840
Here. Member Burr.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.840
Good morning. We have a quorum established.

01:07.840 --> 01:14.840
Okay, good morning. I'm going to start with just the general announcements. For those

01:14.840 --> 01:20.840
who wish to dial in for public comment, members of the public should view the live stream

01:20.840 --> 01:24.840
of the meeting to know at what time we will ask for public comment for each item on the

01:24.840 --> 01:29.840
agenda. Public comment may be provided by dialing the phone number and the participant

01:29.840 --> 01:35.840
access code and then following each of the operator's prompts. Upon dialing in, callers

01:35.840 --> 01:40.840
will be added to a caller queue. The operator will notify callers when it is their turn to

01:40.840 --> 01:46.840
provide public comment and will also ask the public to call in for public comment to please

01:46.840 --> 01:52.840
turn down the speaker volume of their computers if they're following the live feed to avoid

01:52.840 --> 01:57.840
an echoing effect. Public comment will be limited to one minute for each speaker. Board

01:57.840 --> 02:01.840
members, please mute your microphones when you're not speaking and keep your cameras

02:01.840 --> 02:06.840
on at all times except during scheduled breaks to ensure that we maintain a quorum throughout

02:06.840 --> 02:14.840
today's virtual meeting. If you do need to take a break, please do turn your camera off

02:14.840 --> 02:21.840
at that time and try to space your break so that we maintain a quorum. For each item on the

02:21.840 --> 02:25.840
agenda, there will be an opportunity for you to raise your hand and use the Zoom participant

02:25.840 --> 02:30.840
window if you'd like to ask a question or make a comment. And we're going to begin with item

02:30.840 --> 02:36.840
three. Item three is the approval of indicator 17 of the state performance plan and annual

02:36.840 --> 02:42.840
performance report for special education. And the CDE recommends that state board approve

02:42.840 --> 02:48.840
the state's systemic improvement plan prepared by the special education division to be

02:48.840 --> 02:54.840
submitted to the federal office of special education programs by the mandated submission date

02:54.840 --> 03:03.840
of April 1st, 2021. This item will be presented by Heather Kalanis and Shiloh Bessemil of the CDE.

03:04.840 --> 03:18.840
So please begin. Hi. Good morning. Good morning. All right. All right. Good morning, everyone.

03:18.840 --> 03:23.840
I'm Heather Kalanis, the director of the special education division. And we're here today to talk

03:23.840 --> 03:29.840
about the state systemic improvement plan or the ESSEP as we like to call it as an acronym.

03:29.840 --> 03:36.840
So we'll head to the next slide. And actually, we'll walk through and really talk about what is

03:36.840 --> 03:42.840
the ESSEP, how did we get here, how is it going currently in terms of implementation, and then

03:42.840 --> 03:52.840
talk about next steps towards the end of the presentation as well. The ESSEP is, as Dr. Linda

03:52.840 --> 03:58.840
Darling-Hammond stated earlier, is it's part of the annual performance report and state

03:58.840 --> 04:06.840
performance plan that the board approved in January. The APR includes 17 indicators that measure

04:06.840 --> 04:11.840
outcomes for students with disabilities. And so the ESSEP actually is the last indicator,

04:11.840 --> 04:18.840
indicator 17. And so we'll talk a little bit about what that means. It's a mix of really compliance

04:18.840 --> 04:26.840
and results indicators as well. The next slide. The ESSEP is really designed to be a comprehensive

04:29.840 --> 04:35.840
multi-year plan that's really focused on improving results and outcomes for students with

04:35.840 --> 04:41.840
disabilities. And so the ESSEP is designed really to be implemented across states in order to have

04:41.840 --> 04:47.840
maximum impact for students with disabilities. And so it's a little more dynamic than some of the

04:47.840 --> 04:55.840
other indicators because it is sort of a real-time multi-year process that states undergo.

04:55.840 --> 05:04.840
Next slide. The ESSEP itself covers seven years. So this ESSEP was developed in the 13-14

05:04.840 --> 05:10.840
years. So we are now in really the final year of the ESSEP. And so we'll talk a little bit about

05:10.840 --> 05:16.840
that today and sort of what that means for state of California. The ESSEP is developed in

05:16.840 --> 05:22.840
three phases. And so we'll talk about those phases and sort of what they encompass.

05:22.840 --> 05:26.840
But for your reference and knowledge, we are currently obviously in the last and final phase of

05:26.840 --> 05:35.840
phase three. And the goal of the ESSEP really is to really look at alignment across state and

05:35.840 --> 05:43.840
federal systems so that the students with disabilities are supported sort of within that system

05:43.840 --> 05:51.840
as well. Next slide. And so the phases that I mentioned before, the phase one really is

05:51.840 --> 05:59.840
looking at data and really identifying evidence-based practices that can be scaled across

05:59.840 --> 06:07.840
the state. And so part of that data analysis includes determining a state-identified

06:07.840 --> 06:13.840
measurable result we like to call the simmer. And then a selection of strategies and then

06:13.840 --> 06:19.840
obviously implementation as well. So that sort of bleeds into phase two. And for us, phase two

06:19.840 --> 06:26.840
really in terms of the implementation looked at really sort of that infrastructure development

06:26.840 --> 06:32.840
support for LEAs and the implementation of the best practices as well. Phase three in which we're

06:32.840 --> 06:38.840
currently at now is data before, is really looking at the results, how far did we progress, and

06:38.840 --> 06:47.840
then looking at the consideration of any revisions to the ESSEP as well. Next slide. In terms of

06:47.840 --> 06:55.840
California's theory of action, the theory of action that was developed in 2013-2014 is really

06:55.840 --> 07:01.840
broad, but it looked at the accountability efforts and resources to ensure that they're, one,

07:01.840 --> 07:09.840
aligned and that they're also evidence-based and included in comprehensive plans such as the

07:09.840 --> 07:15.840
LCAP to really meaningfully address students with disabilities along with their peers to improve

07:15.840 --> 07:21.840
outcomes. So really broad ESSEP, but also given the state of California and how big it is in the

07:22.840 --> 07:30.840
various needs, sort of met the needs of California during that time period. Next slide.

07:30.840 --> 07:36.840
These slides here you've seen before, actually you've seen them in January, but just again to

07:36.840 --> 07:44.840
remind the board here that when we're looking at socioeconomically disadvantaged students with

07:45.840 --> 07:55.840
IEPs in the 1920s school year, 13% of those also have IEPs. Next slide. And again, foster youth

07:55.840 --> 08:05.840
again, 20% of foster youth within the state of California have IEPs. Next slide. And then English

08:05.840 --> 08:15.840
learners with IEPs in 1920 with 17% as well. Next slide. And then in terms of students with

08:15.840 --> 08:25.840
IEPs in one or more of the LCFF student groups, we have 70% of students with IEPs that are in one

08:25.840 --> 08:33.840
or more local control funding groups as well. So I will now kick it over to Shiloh to talk a little

08:33.840 --> 08:41.840
bit about the summary of phase two and then talk about phase three as well.

08:41.840 --> 08:49.840
Good morning board members. It's lovely to see you again. As Director Kalamis was talking about

08:50.840 --> 08:56.840
the work we did in the data evaluation and sort of looking at the state of the state, it was very

08:56.840 --> 09:02.840
clear to us that the LCFF student groups and the proportion of students with disabilities within

09:02.840 --> 09:08.840
those groups really made an argument for us to hook into what was already occurring within the

09:08.840 --> 09:16.840
state. Instead of creating a separate process or a separate support system for students with

09:16.840 --> 09:22.840
disabilities, it was important to look at what was already being done. And at that point, and this

09:22.840 --> 09:28.840
was in 2014 and 2015, we had this system of support that was working and the dashboard that was

09:28.840 --> 09:34.840
starting. And so all of this work sort of came together and we decided at the special education

09:34.840 --> 09:42.840
division to really make our SIP part of this system of support. And so as you can see, we sort of

09:42.840 --> 09:48.840
developed, you know, the statewide accountability system became into transition and we sort of

09:48.840 --> 09:54.840
outlined the changes into the state infrastructure that we needed to make so we could align both the

09:54.840 --> 10:00.840
SIP work and our work really with students with disabilities with what was happening already with

10:00.840 --> 10:06.840
LCFF and LCAP implementation. We addressed plans to support our integrated improvement efforts for

10:06.840 --> 10:12.840
students with disabilities. One of the biggest things that we did is we sort of re-lined our

10:12.840 --> 10:18.840
accounting, our monitoring system so that we were using the same indicators. We worked very closely

10:18.840 --> 10:24.840
with our system of support partners and included being at the table talking consistently about how

10:24.840 --> 10:30.840
we can improve both the outcomes for all students because as you know, students with disabilities are

10:30.840 --> 10:34.840
part of the general education population and they are part of their general education students first.

10:34.840 --> 10:39.840
And so we wanted to really make that clear within our SIP that we were part of the system of support

10:39.840 --> 10:45.840
and part of the functionality of improving all students. So this was really reiterated, a coherent

10:45.840 --> 10:52.840
approach and offering support to LEAs who identified both in our monitoring system as being support

10:52.840 --> 10:58.840
for students with disabilities but also through the dashboard differentiated assistance. As you

10:58.840 --> 11:04.840
remember, the first year that we identified districts as being in differentiated assistance, well

11:04.840 --> 11:10.840
over 60% of those districts were identified because of their outcomes for the students with

11:10.840 --> 11:16.840
disabilities student population. So it was really important for us to make sure that we were working

11:16.840 --> 11:24.840
in step with the system of support. So as you know, phase three was spanned five years with a

11:24.840 --> 11:30.840
report on the progress and our results for the SIP implementation. This report here covers the

11:30.840 --> 11:36.840
fifth year that you're looking at of phase three and implementation and provides sort of a general update

11:36.840 --> 11:46.840
on our implementation process. As you will probably see through our submission that our state

11:46.840 --> 11:52.840
identified measurable result, affectionately known as CIMR, is assessments in both English language

11:52.840 --> 11:58.840
arts and mathematics for students with disabilities. As you know, that kind of causes a little bit of

11:58.840 --> 12:04.840
interesting quandary for us going forward and we'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment.

12:04.840 --> 12:10.840
But what we really looked at, what we wanted to see was if we hooked into identifying districts with

12:10.840 --> 12:16.840
the dashboard indicators and working with the system of support, we believed that that would help

12:16.840 --> 12:22.840
improve outcomes not just for students without disabilities but students with disabilities as well.

12:22.840 --> 12:28.840
And so we would see the increase in those assessment scores overall. As you know, COVID has changed

12:28.840 --> 12:36.840
many things in the world and one of them is our available data for the CIMR. So this is the

12:36.840 --> 12:42.840
based on 1920 and as you know, we received a policy letter, the U.S. Department of Education issued a policy letter

12:42.840 --> 12:48.840
on March 20th and so we do not have any assessment data because California did not give the assessment

12:48.840 --> 12:54.840
and the statewide assessment in 2019-20. But that doesn't mean we haven't made any progress and

12:54.840 --> 12:58.840
Director Calamese is going to talk about some of the work that we've been doing and we also have guests

12:58.840 --> 13:04.840
that are going to talk a little bit more about the work that we've been doing.

13:04.840 --> 13:10.840
During this year to really improve and address some of the concerns that have come up

13:10.840 --> 13:16.840
through LEAs around students with disabilities and their progress.

13:16.840 --> 13:22.840
So Director Calamese is going to talk a little bit more about some of the work that we've done.

13:22.840 --> 13:28.840
But I wanted to sort of highlight the work that we've done within the system of support.

13:28.840 --> 13:34.840
Again, we have talked a lot about the disparities in the work there, our work around

13:34.840 --> 13:40.840
disproportionality, our work within the SELPA leads which we're going to talk a little bit more about

13:40.840 --> 13:46.840
and also the work we've been doing to improve access through our

13:46.840 --> 13:52.840
supporting inclusive practices project. So this is really all the efforts we've been sort of offering

13:52.840 --> 13:56.840
through both the system of support and for our students and our districts who are struggling around

13:56.840 --> 14:02.840
outcomes for students with disabilities. And that was really the biggest part of our work

14:02.840 --> 14:08.840
inside of this, inside the SF. So as you'll see, we'll talk a little bit more about that.

14:08.840 --> 14:14.840
But we wanted to highlight the process that we went through. We started with looking at our data.

14:14.840 --> 14:20.840
And those are the charts that you see affectionately known as the Pacman charts where you see the data

14:20.840 --> 14:25.840
really shows that when you're talking about the LCFF student groups, you're not talking about students with disabilities

14:25.840 --> 14:31.840
separate. They're part of those groups. And so it made sense to us to hook into a much larger system.

14:31.840 --> 14:37.840
What that meant for us over time and over the last five years is that our SF has been

14:37.840 --> 14:43.840
about statewide implementation in many states across the country.

14:43.840 --> 14:49.840
Their SF started very small, a few schools in one district or a couple of districts

14:49.840 --> 14:53.840
and with an attempt to scale up. We did not take that approach here in California.

14:53.840 --> 14:59.840
The approach we took was we're going to start with everyone and we are going to do as much as we can

14:59.840 --> 15:05.840
within the system that we believe will work and that is through the system of support.

15:05.840 --> 15:09.840
And so that is the process that we've been working through these last five years.

15:09.840 --> 15:15.840
And so I'm going to send it back to Director Calamese so she can talk a little bit about the efforts that we've been going through this year

15:15.840 --> 15:19.840
that have really rounded out this asset.

15:27.840 --> 15:33.840
Let me unmute myself. In terms of, I think we can probably go to the next slide.

15:33.840 --> 15:39.840
In terms of actually the partnering with our self assistance improvement leads, as you may or may not know,

15:39.840 --> 15:45.840
our SELPA improvement leads are located in El Dorado County SELPA, West San Gabriel,

15:45.840 --> 15:51.840
and then the Riverside County SELPA really serve as our SELPA improvement leads

15:51.840 --> 15:59.840
across the state and have been foundational in this work as they all three really build capacity

15:59.840 --> 16:05.840
across our, you know, in terms of improvement process for SELPAs across the state.

16:05.840 --> 16:13.840
Also looking at developing and implementing new tools and resources for our SELPA leaders to use.

16:13.840 --> 16:17.840
They also launched a series of coffee talks which were virtually facilitated meetings

16:17.840 --> 16:22.840
to really focus on pressing topics and challenges in the field.

16:22.840 --> 16:28.840
And then also the SELPA project also launched the data improvement center

16:28.840 --> 16:36.840
and that sort of data center, if you will, displays six years of state performance

16:36.840 --> 16:44.840
or SPP indicator data and tools to really assist SELPA and LEA administrators

16:44.840 --> 16:48.840
in developing or identifying patterns and trends and data sort of trajectories

16:48.840 --> 16:53.840
so that, you know, folks are able to sort of get down the field and in front of issues

16:53.840 --> 16:57.840
and really identify them and proactively address them before they bubble up

16:57.840 --> 17:03.840
and become problematic across LEAs at the local level.

17:03.840 --> 17:08.840
So that tool is really useful in sort of looking and projecting down the field

17:08.840 --> 17:13.840
and really offering real-time data to our community in the field.

17:13.840 --> 17:16.840
You can go to the next slide.

17:16.840 --> 17:21.840
In terms of the sort of next subset down are the content leads.

17:21.840 --> 17:25.840
And so our content leads really are focused on implementing and providing

17:25.840 --> 17:30.840
evidence-based practices to really effectuate change for our students with disabilities.

17:30.840 --> 17:34.840
So, you know, just in short, run down the list here.

17:34.840 --> 17:40.840
Our content leads consist of the Imperial County SELPA,

17:40.840 --> 17:43.840
and they serve as a content lead for our duly identified students

17:43.840 --> 17:48.840
who are identified with a disability but also identified as an English learner as well.

17:48.840 --> 17:54.840
Our South County SELPA serves as our lead as really through disproportionality

17:54.840 --> 18:00.840
through our equity disproportionality and design project.

18:00.840 --> 18:05.840
Our Marin County SELPA really is supporting the,

18:05.840 --> 18:10.840
in partnership with the California Autism Professional Training and Information Network,

18:10.840 --> 18:14.840
is the lead for really those best practices for students

18:14.840 --> 18:18.840
that are identified across the spectrum, across the state.

18:18.840 --> 18:21.840
We have our supporting included practices,

18:21.840 --> 18:25.840
which you'll hear from a little bit later in just a little bit.

18:25.840 --> 18:35.840
And then we also have the California scale up in terms of our NTSS system statewide as well.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.840
Okay, next slide.

18:38.840 --> 18:42.840
And then...

18:42.840 --> 18:45.840
Sorry, I think this is the point where we're going to go with our guests.

18:45.840 --> 18:51.840
Yep, so at this point, I will hand it over to our guests,

18:51.840 --> 18:55.840
and they will walk us through some of the implementation

18:55.840 --> 19:01.840
and the effects of the implementation across the state as well.

19:01.840 --> 19:07.840
So we wanted to introduce our folks from the Supporting Inclusive Practices Project,

19:07.840 --> 19:09.840
Kristen Brooks and Kevin Schaefer.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.840
They're going to present some of the work that they've been doing this year

19:12.840 --> 19:16.840
across their project along with a couple of LEAs

19:16.840 --> 19:19.840
and sort of highlight some of the successes that they've had

19:19.840 --> 19:24.840
in sort of implementing some of the work even in our current pandemic environment.

19:24.840 --> 19:29.840
So we're very, very happy to introduce both Kevin Schaefer and Kristen Brooks.

19:29.840 --> 19:32.840
I'm going to stop sharing and allow them to share,

19:32.840 --> 19:35.840
and then they will walk you through that.

19:35.840 --> 19:39.840
And then we will finish up the presentation talking about sort of the next steps

19:39.840 --> 19:42.840
around our ESSEP project and our work.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.840
So thank you.

19:56.840 --> 19:59.840
Good morning, and thank you for this opportunity to share our work with you.

19:59.840 --> 20:00.840
My name is Kristen Brooks,

20:00.840 --> 20:03.840
Executive Director with the Supporting Inclusive Practices Project

20:03.840 --> 20:06.840
out of Riverside County Office of Education.

20:06.840 --> 20:09.840
And alongside me is Kevin Schaefer, whom you'll hear from momentarily.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.840
He's the Director of Equity and Inclusion out of El Dorado

20:12.840 --> 20:14.840
and also co-director of SIP.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.840
You'll also hear from educators, leaders, and project partners

20:17.840 --> 20:20.840
deeply dedicated to the work within SIP throughout the state.

20:20.840 --> 20:23.840
But we'd like to first start by sharing about what it is that we do,

20:23.840 --> 20:27.840
for those of you who don't know much about our project just yet.

20:27.840 --> 20:30.840
So our vision in Supporting Inclusive Practices

20:31.840 --> 20:35.840
is to intentionally design equitable and inclusive systems for all kids.

20:35.840 --> 20:39.840
And our tagline here is sort of innovate, include, and impact.

20:39.840 --> 20:43.840
And our mission and focus is to provide tiered technical assistance

20:43.840 --> 20:45.840
to our LEAs throughout the state,

20:45.840 --> 20:50.840
focused on those indicators that Shiloh and Heather went through just earlier

20:50.840 --> 20:52.840
in terms of three, five, six, and seven.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.840
And those are focused on least restrictive environment or inclusion,

20:55.840 --> 20:59.840
as well as achievement for kids pre-K through 22.

20:59.840 --> 21:03.840
And this tiered technical assistance is in the form of one, tier one level

21:03.840 --> 21:06.840
is providing professional learning and thought partnering

21:06.840 --> 21:09.840
and sharing resources with anyone throughout California

21:09.840 --> 21:12.840
who's interested in increasing inclusion and achievement

21:12.840 --> 21:14.840
for students with disabilities.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.840
But really we're talking about all students.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.840
Once we start saying we're just talking about students with disabilities,

21:19.840 --> 21:21.840
we're doing the opposite of inclusion, right?

21:21.840 --> 21:23.840
We are by default starting to segregate kids.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.840
So we're really talking about how do we address the needs

21:25.840 --> 21:28.840
of all marginalized populations throughout the state.

21:28.840 --> 21:30.840
So this professional learning and thought partnering

21:30.840 --> 21:33.840
and resource sharing is at no cost to anyone in California.

21:33.840 --> 21:37.840
At a tier two level, we have 50 grantees across California,

21:37.840 --> 21:40.840
and they are really focused on that direct,

21:40.840 --> 21:42.840
we're working on direct support with them.

21:42.840 --> 21:46.840
So boots on the ground work and looking at what is their current state

21:46.840 --> 21:48.840
and their desired state and how do we get there.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.840
It's not a toolkit saying this is how you do inclusion

21:50.840 --> 21:54.840
or this is how you reach these achievement milestones.

21:54.840 --> 21:57.840
It's really about what's unique to their culture and their community

21:57.840 --> 21:59.840
and walking alongside them in this journey

21:59.840 --> 22:02.840
and providing that support along the way.

22:02.840 --> 22:05.840
At a tier three level, that's when the department contacts us

22:05.840 --> 22:10.840
and asks us to provide project support or webinars

22:10.840 --> 22:13.840
or convene and work with a different district

22:13.840 --> 22:15.840
who may not be a named grantee.

22:15.840 --> 22:17.840
Secondly, we support those leadership teams

22:17.840 --> 22:19.840
and their intentional design and sometimes redesign

22:19.840 --> 22:21.840
of their systems and support.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.840
Sometimes we have to take a couple steps back

22:23.840 --> 22:26.840
to take a few more steps forward, and there's nothing wrong with that.

22:26.840 --> 22:28.840
Again, we're meeting folks with where they're at.

22:28.840 --> 22:31.840
And then lastly, it's really about envisioning those outcomes,

22:31.840 --> 22:34.840
building capacity, and ultimately want to implement and scale

22:34.840 --> 22:36.840
and pay it forward and serve as a model for others,

22:36.840 --> 22:39.840
and focused on culture, policy, and practice.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.840
So what do we believe about kids?

22:41.840 --> 22:43.840
What are those policies that enforce what we believe?

22:43.840 --> 22:45.840
And then what are the practices happening in the classroom?

22:45.840 --> 22:48.840
We don't want to just put fancy vision and mission statements on the wall

22:48.840 --> 22:50.840
and say, you know, we hope to get there,

22:50.840 --> 22:53.840
but really how are we impacting kids down at the classroom level?

22:54.840 --> 22:56.840
And so this is just a quick graphic

22:56.840 --> 22:58.840
about where our grantees are throughout California.

22:58.840 --> 23:03.840
You can see very far down south, anyone from Los Angeles Unified,

23:03.840 --> 23:05.840
a large district of Ventura County,

23:05.840 --> 23:08.840
all the way up to Wairika Union and Siskiyou up in the north.

23:08.840 --> 23:11.840
So we are throughout California and really, again,

23:11.840 --> 23:15.840
working alongside in a very organic process with our districts

23:15.840 --> 23:19.840
and supporting them to get where they want to be, to hit their targets.

23:19.840 --> 23:21.840
And just a caveat, if you look at any of our final reports,

23:21.840 --> 23:24.840
you'll see that our districts are increasing in inclusion and achievement

23:24.840 --> 23:28.840
anywhere between 5% and 12% across three years,

23:28.840 --> 23:31.840
so longitudinally as high as some of our outliers in 24%.

23:31.840 --> 23:35.840
So we're making huge gains in inclusion and achievement for our kids.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.840
And we really believe that it's because of this relationship

23:38.840 --> 23:41.840
and this organic walking alongside folks

23:41.840 --> 23:43.840
and serving as coaches along the way.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.840
It's not just kind of a one and done support,

23:45.840 --> 23:49.840
but really taking this across time with them towards improvements.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.840
So I'd like to turn it over to Kevin.

23:51.840 --> 23:54.840
Thank you, Kristen, and good morning, board members.

23:54.840 --> 23:58.840
We utilize a blueprint for inclusion to work with our grantees,

23:58.840 --> 24:00.840
knowing that many of our grantees,

24:00.840 --> 24:06.840
some have bought into improvement science through the CILT grant project,

24:06.840 --> 24:08.840
and others utilize implementation science.

24:08.840 --> 24:14.840
So our approach is one of really looking at and honoring the context

24:15.840 --> 24:19.840
in which each of our grantees are implementing inclusive practices.

24:19.840 --> 24:22.840
So as Kristen mentioned earlier, we start with envisioning.

24:22.840 --> 24:25.840
We work with a cohesive leadership team,

24:25.840 --> 24:30.840
and we address the vision, mission, and values that are specific to that LEA.

24:30.840 --> 24:33.840
And honoring that vision, mission, and value statement,

24:33.840 --> 24:37.840
we want to enforce that to move into our behaviors.

24:37.840 --> 24:41.840
And do our behaviors reflect our vision, mission, and values

24:41.840 --> 24:45.840
around all students achieving to the best of their potential?

24:45.840 --> 24:49.840
Once we've defined what our vision is for inclusion, we build the system.

24:49.840 --> 24:55.840
We ensure that the building of the system is created prior to the implementation

24:55.840 --> 24:59.840
of the supports that have been designed around inclusion

24:59.840 --> 25:03.840
before any of the users, the teachers, the families, the students

25:03.840 --> 25:08.840
experience those innovations so that they're set up to be successful

25:08.840 --> 25:10.840
in the implementation process.

25:10.840 --> 25:14.840
And then we want to scale up across the organization, across the LEA,

25:14.840 --> 25:16.840
across the state, et cetera.

25:16.840 --> 25:29.840
And then once we've reached a level of project reaching their scale

25:29.840 --> 25:32.840
that we had expected or envisioned, then we want to pay it forward.

25:32.840 --> 25:35.840
We want to create model sites.

25:35.840 --> 25:38.840
We want to create model organizations so that others can benefit

25:38.840 --> 25:41.840
from the work that has been done.

25:41.840 --> 25:45.840
Next slide.

25:45.840 --> 25:48.840
And you can find out more about the Supporting Inclusive Practice,

25:48.840 --> 25:53.840
this project, from our website at www.sipinclusion,

25:53.840 --> 25:55.840
as well as our social media.

25:55.840 --> 26:00.840
Our focus is to create a community across the state such that we can move

26:00.840 --> 26:05.840
beyond just the 50 grantees that we work with, but influence inclusion

26:05.840 --> 26:10.840
beyond just the Supporting Inclusive Practice project,

26:10.840 --> 26:14.840
and thought partner with others as much as our capacity allows.

26:14.840 --> 26:19.840
And you'll find on our website all of the no-cost registration for our events,

26:19.840 --> 26:24.840
as well as the archives of the EDGE newsletter

26:24.840 --> 26:28.840
and the distance learning innovations for special education.

26:28.840 --> 26:30.840
Next slide.

26:30.840 --> 26:34.840
And what we've learned in our experience over the past six years,

26:34.840 --> 26:39.840
the project has been in existence, is that there's not a toolkit for inclusion.

26:39.840 --> 26:44.840
It's an organic process that honors the context, the initiatives,

26:44.840 --> 26:48.840
the priorities around each individual LEA.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.840
And it has to be intentional design.

26:50.840 --> 26:53.840
That's why we start with the envisioning within our blueprint.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.840
What is the vision and how do we build it?

26:56.840 --> 27:00.840
And that's where the support for Supporting Inclusive Practices comes into play.

27:00.840 --> 27:05.840
And we have to work with school boards, superintendents, and leadership teams,

27:05.840 --> 27:11.840
especially in that envisioning, building, and implementation process.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.840
How do we communicate?

27:13.840 --> 27:19.840
How do we create a sense of urgency within our systems that this work has to be done

27:19.840 --> 27:23.840
in a very thoughtful way, but also with that sense of urgency

27:23.840 --> 27:27.840
that our students are currently moving through the system?

27:27.840 --> 27:32.840
Shiloh had mentioned earlier that students with disabilities are general education students first.

27:32.840 --> 27:36.840
If we don't break down those silos and self-imposed barriers,

27:36.840 --> 27:41.840
then we are creating a bifurcated system in which students with disabilities

27:41.840 --> 27:45.840
will continue to be marginalized and disproportionately represented

27:45.840 --> 27:48.840
in our special education system.

27:48.840 --> 27:51.840
And then finally, we have to change our adult mindsets.

27:51.840 --> 27:53.840
We start with culture.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.840
What do we think about students with disabilities?

27:56.840 --> 28:00.840
Do we own the fact that students with disabilities are not achieving

28:00.840 --> 28:02.840
at the same rates as other students?

28:02.840 --> 28:06.840
We have to change adult mindsets, get the system ready,

28:06.840 --> 28:10.840
and re-culture with a focus on relationships with each other,

28:10.840 --> 28:13.840
relationships with our students, relationships with our families,

28:13.840 --> 28:15.840
and our community stakeholders.

28:15.840 --> 28:20.840
So we wanted to make sure that we left enough time so that we could allow

28:20.840 --> 28:23.840
for our grantees to share the amazing work that they have been doing.

28:23.840 --> 28:26.840
And I would like to hand it over to Heather Richardson,

28:26.840 --> 28:30.840
the Eureka City Schools Director of Early Childhood Education.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.840
Heather?

28:32.840 --> 28:34.840
Hi, everyone. Thank you so much for having me here today.

28:34.840 --> 28:37.840
Like Kevin said, I'm Heather Richardson.

28:37.840 --> 28:40.840
I'm the Director of Early Education for Eureka City Schools

28:40.840 --> 28:43.840
all the way up here in Humboldt County, California.

28:43.840 --> 28:47.840
So with the support of regional and state partners,

28:47.840 --> 28:49.840
including Kevin and Kristen and the SIPP team,

28:49.840 --> 28:52.840
Mindy and our Humboldt Del Norte SELPA,

28:52.840 --> 28:55.840
and now with Patty and the CAPTN program,

28:55.840 --> 28:58.840
our district preschool program, which is Winsler Children's Center,

28:58.840 --> 29:03.840
has reinvented the way that we've provided our special education services

29:03.840 --> 29:05.840
through inclusive practices.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.840
Over the past three school years,

29:07.840 --> 29:10.840
we've moved from a completely separate SDC classroom

29:10.840 --> 29:14.840
to a fully inclusive preschool model in all of our classrooms.

29:14.840 --> 29:20.840
I'm incredibly proud of the hard work all of our early educators

29:20.840 --> 29:23.840
have been doing here every day to build strong foundations

29:23.840 --> 29:25.840
for all of our students,

29:25.840 --> 29:28.840
and the work that's being done here is deepening our connections

29:28.840 --> 29:30.840
with each other, with families,

29:30.840 --> 29:34.840
and has proven to have lasting effects on all of our students' outcomes

29:34.840 --> 29:37.840
well beyond their preschool years here with us.

29:37.840 --> 29:41.840
So the support that we've received from our school district,

29:41.840 --> 29:43.840
the SELPA and at the state level through SIPP,

29:43.840 --> 29:46.840
has helped us reinvent our program,

29:46.840 --> 29:48.840
and it's helped us create a system that will,

29:48.840 --> 29:51.840
while it's still very much in progress,

29:51.840 --> 29:55.840
has become a model for what quality and inclusive practices

29:55.840 --> 29:57.840
can look like in early childhood programs

29:57.840 --> 30:01.840
and how they can be scaled up in other programs across the state.

30:01.840 --> 30:05.840
SIPP grant funding has allowed us to enhance our learning environment

30:05.840 --> 30:07.840
in our own program

30:07.840 --> 30:11.840
and also pursue professional development opportunities,

30:11.840 --> 30:15.840
including sending a team of 11 educators from our school district

30:15.840 --> 30:19.840
and our county office to the California Beginning Together

30:19.840 --> 30:22.840
Inclusion Facilitator Training Institute

30:22.840 --> 30:25.840
all the way down in San Diego in 2019.

30:25.840 --> 30:29.840
Through our program's continuous improvement cycles,

30:29.840 --> 30:32.840
we've identified needs in supporting students with autism,

30:32.840 --> 30:36.840
and through our SELPA, we're able to pursue captain's support

30:36.840 --> 30:39.840
in the use of evidence-based practices,

30:39.840 --> 30:42.840
as well as continue networking with programs and districts

30:42.840 --> 30:45.840
across the state as a SIPP grantee.

30:45.840 --> 30:49.840
And to say that I'm excited to see where we're going to be going next

30:49.840 --> 30:51.840
is a total understatement.

30:51.840 --> 30:53.840
So now I'm going to turn it over to Mindy,

30:53.840 --> 30:56.840
and she's going to share a little bit about the work being done

30:56.840 --> 30:59.840
at the Humboldt Del Norte SELPA level.

31:02.840 --> 31:05.840
Great. Thank you, Heather.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.840
Good morning, everyone, and thank you again.

31:07.840 --> 31:10.840
My name is Mindy Fatig, and I'm the executive director

31:10.840 --> 31:12.840
of Humboldt Del Norte SELPA and the current chair

31:12.840 --> 31:15.840
for the State SELPA Administrators Association of California.

31:15.840 --> 31:19.840
Our SELPA has been a Captain Cadre member since 2013.

31:19.840 --> 31:21.840
Locally, we have seen a tremendous increase

31:21.840 --> 31:23.840
in the number of students with autism over the years,

31:23.840 --> 31:25.840
as I'm sure everyone has had statewide,

31:25.840 --> 31:29.840
and it continues to remain a priority to bring evidence-based practices

31:29.840 --> 31:33.840
in educating our students with autism in the least restrictive environment.

31:33.840 --> 31:36.840
It's also been a priority noted with our local SELPA governance board

31:36.840 --> 31:39.840
to continue the support and have funded a portion of a behavior

31:39.840 --> 31:43.840
since 2013 to provide the support to students, families,

31:43.840 --> 31:46.840
and staff in all of our districts.

31:46.840 --> 31:48.840
For the past three years, SELPA has partnered with

31:48.840 --> 31:51.840
Riga City Schools' Heather Richardson and her group,

31:51.840 --> 31:55.840
Humboldt County Office of Education, and supporting inclusive practices,

31:55.840 --> 31:57.840
the SIPP grant with Kevin and Kristen,

31:57.840 --> 32:00.840
working on providing training, coaching, and support

32:00.840 --> 32:03.840
for successful implementation of inclusive environments.

32:03.840 --> 32:06.840
Again, a focus this year and the last three years

32:06.840 --> 32:08.840
has been on the inclusive programs in the Winsler site,

32:08.840 --> 32:09.840
which Heather talked about.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.840
In addition, Humboldt Del Norte SELPA applied

32:11.840 --> 32:13.840
and was selected to be a regional captain lead

32:13.840 --> 32:16.840
for the coastal region of far northern California,

32:16.840 --> 32:18.840
which Patty's going to talk about later.

32:18.840 --> 32:21.840
We recognize the education historically has been in silos.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.840
Special education, general education,

32:23.840 --> 32:27.840
and even sometimes unintentionally grant work has been in silos.

32:27.840 --> 32:30.840
So this was really a thoughtful, mindful opportunity

32:30.840 --> 32:32.840
to bring the resources and expertise

32:32.840 --> 32:34.840
through the California Department of Education state grants

32:34.840 --> 32:36.840
of the SIPP work with Kevin and Kristen,

32:36.840 --> 32:39.840
with the district, and the state captain regional grant

32:39.840 --> 32:41.840
through the SELPA to bring comprehensive,

32:41.840 --> 32:44.840
collaborative, evidence-based practices to build upon

32:44.840 --> 32:47.840
and expand our inclusive preschool programs.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.840
And of course, as Heather said, they benefit all students,

32:49.840 --> 32:51.840
both academically and social-emotionally,

32:51.840 --> 32:55.840
and especially in our far rural area up here in Humboldt County,

32:55.840 --> 32:59.840
where staffing supports and resources can be extremely challenging.

32:59.840 --> 33:02.840
So we all know it's about providing equitable opportunities

33:02.840 --> 33:04.840
in the least restrictive environment

33:04.840 --> 33:06.840
that benefit all of our students.

33:06.840 --> 33:09.840
We are seeing firsthand the benefit of these inclusive programs

33:09.840 --> 33:11.840
with ongoing staff training and support,

33:11.840 --> 33:13.840
and really a true partnership in learning

33:13.840 --> 33:15.840
with families and students and staff.

33:15.840 --> 33:19.840
I can tell you it's an exciting time up here in Humboldt-Delmar SELPA

33:19.840 --> 33:22.840
to bring the work of the county, the district, and the SELPA

33:22.840 --> 33:26.840
with two state grants to collaboratively pool resources,

33:26.840 --> 33:28.840
expertise, and learn from one another

33:28.840 --> 33:30.840
to better the outcomes for all of our students.

33:30.840 --> 33:33.840
And we are proud of the work of our teachers and admin collaboratively

33:33.840 --> 33:36.840
and what they've done in order to create this model program.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.840
And not only, as Heather was talking about,

33:38.840 --> 33:42.840
we've created this really awesome, fantastic inclusive preschool program,

33:42.840 --> 33:48.840
but we're really setting the foundation of support through SIPP and CAPTED

33:48.840 --> 33:51.840
to expand those inclusive practices throughout the grades,

33:51.840 --> 33:54.840
not only just in Eureka City Schools and their district,

33:54.840 --> 33:58.840
but SELPA-wide in all of our districts, which is over 32 school districts.

33:58.840 --> 34:02.840
So very excited with this work, very excited with the collaboration,

34:02.840 --> 34:08.840
and again, much appreciative to the CAPTED and the SIPP grants that we have.

34:08.840 --> 34:09.840
We couldn't do it without them.

34:09.840 --> 34:12.840
And to discuss more about the important work of the state CAPTED grants,

34:12.840 --> 34:14.840
which has been vital in this work,

34:14.840 --> 34:16.840
I'm going to turn it over to Patty at this point.

34:18.840 --> 34:19.840
Thank you.

34:19.840 --> 34:25.840
As Director Fatig mentioned, CAPTED came into existence in 2013

34:25.840 --> 34:29.840
as a partnership between the California Department of Education Diagnostic Centers,

34:29.840 --> 34:33.840
the Department of Developmental Services, and the UC Davis MIND Institute

34:33.840 --> 34:38.840
in order to implement the recommendations of the Legislative Blue Ribbon Commission

34:38.840 --> 34:41.840
and the Superintendent's Autism Advisory Committee

34:41.840 --> 34:44.840
for improving services and outcomes for students with autism.

34:44.840 --> 34:47.840
In order to disseminate vetted resources and information,

34:47.840 --> 34:52.840
we first developed a website that links users to online learning modules,

34:52.840 --> 34:56.840
infographics, and other resources about evidence-based practices in autism.

34:57.840 --> 35:03.840
This website and its contents are universal support that are available to anyone for free.

35:03.840 --> 35:10.840
As Director Fatig shared, our Tier 2 targeted supports involve our Captain Cadre,

35:10.840 --> 35:15.840
who are deployed through each SELPA to assist teachers in specific classrooms

35:15.840 --> 35:20.840
with learning to implement evidence-based practices

35:20.840 --> 35:23.840
using high-quality professional development practices.

35:23.840 --> 35:27.840
Beginning in 2019, we partnered with the Marin County SELPA

35:27.840 --> 35:31.840
as the SELPA content lead for autism and evidence-based practices

35:31.840 --> 35:34.840
and began offering Tier 3 intensive supports.

35:34.840 --> 35:38.840
These supports are designed to build each SELPA's capacity for supporting their districts

35:38.840 --> 35:44.840
in the use and scale-up of evidence-based practices that will result in improved outcomes.

35:44.840 --> 35:47.840
We've recruited 13 SELPAs as partners in this work

35:47.840 --> 35:52.840
and are training their teams in the use of implementation science strategies and practices.

35:52.840 --> 35:56.840
These SELPAs in turn work with their districts, establishing district teams,

35:56.840 --> 36:02.840
and setting up transformation zones where the infrastructure, systems, and supports are put in place

36:02.840 --> 36:07.840
to begin to scale the use of evidence-based practices across the entire district.

36:07.840 --> 36:11.840
So in this case, Humboldt Del Norte SELPA is one of our 13 SELPA partners,

36:11.840 --> 36:15.840
and they're working with Eureka City Schools beginning at the preschool level

36:15.840 --> 36:20.840
as their transformation zone for using evidence-based practices to improve LRE

36:20.840 --> 36:24.840
capacity for students with intensive support needs such as autism,

36:24.840 --> 36:29.840
with the eventual goal being to scale these practices across the entire district.

36:29.840 --> 36:32.840
Next slide.

36:32.840 --> 36:35.840
In summary, our formula for success is simple.

36:35.840 --> 36:40.840
Evidence-based practices multiplied by effective training, coaching, leadership,

36:40.840 --> 36:45.840
and regionalized supports multiplied by creating the systems within the SELPAs

36:45.840 --> 36:49.840
and LEAs will result in better outcomes for students.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.840
Thank you for the opportunity to share our work with you here today,

36:52.840 --> 36:58.840
and I'm going to now hand it back to Kristin Brooks with the Supporting Inclusive Practices.

36:58.840 --> 37:03.840
Thank you so much. Amazing work you guys are doing. Really appreciate you being able to share it today.

37:03.840 --> 37:07.840
I'd like to now turn it over to Drs. Matheny and Betters.

37:07.840 --> 37:12.840
We're traveling down south here in California now to talk about the East Valley SELPA approach to SIPP

37:12.840 --> 37:16.840
working alongside San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools.

37:16.840 --> 37:20.840
Thank you, Kristin, and I would like to thank the board for this opportunity.

37:20.840 --> 37:26.840
And we're going to share our journey as we begin to be a recipient of a SIPP grant.

37:26.840 --> 37:30.840
And so to begin with, just a little bit about the East Valley SELPA.

37:30.840 --> 37:36.840
We're a multi-district SELPA in San Bernardino County, and as Kristin said, that's in Southern California.

37:36.840 --> 37:41.840
We encompass five unified school districts and a portion of the county office.

37:41.840 --> 37:46.840
Within those five school districts, we have almost 80,000 students,

37:46.840 --> 37:50.840
and 11,000 of those students are students with disabilities.

37:50.840 --> 37:54.840
Our districts are very different from one another.

37:54.840 --> 37:59.840
Some of our districts are in an urban area, some are more rural, and some are suburban.

37:59.840 --> 38:02.840
But that alone doesn't describe the East Valley SELPA.

38:02.840 --> 38:05.840
We have great differences within our region.

38:05.840 --> 38:09.840
So we are the home of one of the world-renowned medical centers,

38:09.840 --> 38:11.840
Loma Linda University Medical Center.

38:11.840 --> 38:18.840
Just a few miles down the street from that center, we have a growing homeless population.

38:18.840 --> 38:23.840
So we have great differences within our community and our communities.

38:23.840 --> 38:28.840
And what we wanted to do is to take a look at what do we value, what do we do,

38:28.840 --> 38:31.840
and what are our next steps to improving.

38:31.840 --> 38:36.840
And so the East Valley SELPA is known for focusing on parent-school relationships,

38:36.840 --> 38:39.840
particularly alternative dispute resolution.

38:39.840 --> 38:42.840
Not only am I the administrator of the East Valley SELPA,

38:42.840 --> 38:46.840
but I'm also the chair for the State Association's ADR committee,

38:46.840 --> 38:49.840
and I'm the treasurer of the State SELPA Association.

38:49.840 --> 38:55.840
And in those capacities, I've planned, facilitated, and hosted the annual ADR conference.

38:55.840 --> 39:00.840
Last week, we had our first virtual conference and had over 1,100 participants.

39:00.840 --> 39:02.840
It was very well received.

39:02.840 --> 39:07.840
I've also worked very closely with Shiloh and Heather's team at CDE

39:07.840 --> 39:13.840
to assist with the grant distribution for the ADR, ADRE, and ADR COVID grants.

39:13.840 --> 39:17.840
In addition, the East Valley SELPA, next slide,

39:17.840 --> 39:22.840
has focused greatly on improving opportunities and outcomes for students with disabilities.

39:22.840 --> 39:26.840
So we are a regional provider of technical support.

39:26.840 --> 39:30.840
We've made sure that school districts meet the state and federal performance targets

39:30.840 --> 39:32.840
that you heard about from Shiloh and Heather,

39:32.840 --> 39:35.840
and we really have now focused on increasing practices

39:35.840 --> 39:40.840
to include students in all settings who have disabilities.

39:40.840 --> 39:45.840
One of the things we've been doing well is that we have not been identified

39:45.840 --> 39:48.840
as districts that are significantly disproportionate,

39:48.840 --> 39:51.840
but we also know that because of our great diversity,

39:51.840 --> 39:55.840
we needed support, and we needed support via this state grant

39:55.840 --> 39:59.840
to expand inclusion, to expand access and equity.

39:59.840 --> 40:04.840
But where did we begin, particularly this year as a first-year grant recipient

40:04.840 --> 40:06.840
and with a pandemic happening?

40:06.840 --> 40:08.840
Where do we start this work?

40:08.840 --> 40:10.840
And so under Kristen's leadership,

40:10.840 --> 40:14.840
we took a look at what is that first stage of implementing this grant,

40:14.840 --> 40:17.840
and we recognized that it was an organic process

40:17.840 --> 40:22.840
and that it would require us to envision and to change mindsets

40:22.840 --> 40:24.840
and work with our school cultures.

40:24.840 --> 40:27.840
And so what I decided to do was to pull together

40:27.840 --> 40:30.840
the East Valley Self-Assist Leadership Team.

40:30.840 --> 40:35.840
And so on the next slide, you'll see that that encompasses three administrators

40:35.840 --> 40:37.840
from each of our school districts,

40:37.840 --> 40:41.840
as well as our county, San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools,

40:41.840 --> 40:45.840
as well as our Chief of Equity and Access, lead of the county.

40:45.840 --> 40:48.840
And so we came together, and we began talking about

40:48.840 --> 40:50.840
how do we inspire people to change?

40:50.840 --> 40:53.840
How do we encourage people to take on the shared vision

40:53.840 --> 40:58.840
of including our students in every capacity on educational campuses?

40:58.840 --> 41:01.840
And we knew we were committed to growing and changing,

41:01.840 --> 41:04.840
but we weren't quite sure how we were going to accomplish that.

41:04.840 --> 41:09.840
And so with Kristen's leadership, we dug into a book study.

41:09.840 --> 41:13.840
And so that book study has been going on now since the late fall,

41:13.840 --> 41:17.840
and it's all around, I think it's on our next slide, Kristen,

41:18.840 --> 41:21.840
a book entitled Change the Culture, Change the Game.

41:21.840 --> 41:24.840
And so this professional learning has brought together

41:24.840 --> 41:26.840
these leaders from our school districts,

41:26.840 --> 41:29.840
which include cabinet members, assistant superintendents,

41:29.840 --> 41:31.840
as well as site principals,

41:31.840 --> 41:36.840
and directors of special education and instructional services.

41:36.840 --> 41:39.840
And what I would like to do next is have one of our members,

41:39.840 --> 41:41.840
our Chief of Equity and Access,

41:41.840 --> 41:45.840
talk to you about her experience as being part of this leadership team

41:45.840 --> 41:48.840
and what she's gained from it and what we hope to be our next steps

41:48.840 --> 41:50.840
as we move forward as a grant recipient.

41:50.840 --> 41:52.840
So Dr. Betters.

41:52.840 --> 41:55.840
Thank you, Dr. Bethany. Good morning, board.

41:55.840 --> 41:58.840
So we recognize that we have the greatest amount of diversity

41:58.840 --> 42:00.840
that we have ever seen as a nation,

42:00.840 --> 42:03.840
and that is represented in our current generation of students.

42:03.840 --> 42:05.840
In fact, we know that research tells us

42:05.840 --> 42:08.840
that they are not only the most diverse generation,

42:08.840 --> 42:11.840
but they have the highest of expectations for diversity

42:11.840 --> 42:13.840
as it relates to their daily lives,

42:13.840 --> 42:16.840
which means the adults in their school environment

42:16.840 --> 42:19.840
and their school experience must be inclusive

42:19.840 --> 42:23.840
of those dimensions of difference to ensure a school culture

42:23.840 --> 42:26.840
that is explicit in clarity and coherence

42:26.840 --> 42:30.840
around the results of providing a sense of belonging for all students.

42:30.840 --> 42:36.840
I have heard the words result and goals a few times this morning,

42:36.840 --> 42:38.840
and I think when we talk about goals or results,

42:38.840 --> 42:40.840
it's important that what we are saying

42:40.840 --> 42:44.840
is that we have common language about what progress looks like.

42:44.840 --> 42:46.840
Next slide, please.

42:46.840 --> 42:50.840
So this book study is really helping us as school leaders

42:50.840 --> 42:55.840
create common language about what to focus on in shifting to

42:55.840 --> 42:59.840
or in some cases enhancing an asset-based lens

42:59.840 --> 43:02.840
to teach it in learning as well as school improvement.

43:02.840 --> 43:04.840
I heard that today too.

43:04.840 --> 43:07.840
And transformation of schools that's going to anchor us

43:07.840 --> 43:12.840
to the result of having school cultures that benefit each student

43:12.840 --> 43:15.840
and especially those that have been identified with exceptional needs.

43:15.840 --> 43:21.840
Next slide, please.

43:21.840 --> 43:24.840
Survey. That's not my slide.

43:24.840 --> 43:26.840
Did we skip a slide? That's okay.

43:26.840 --> 43:29.840
And to move from current culture to new culture,

43:29.840 --> 43:31.840
we have to be able to acknowledge difference,

43:31.840 --> 43:33.840
but not to get stuck there.

43:33.840 --> 43:36.840
Peter Drucker says that culture eats strategy for breakfast,

43:36.840 --> 43:41.840
meaning culture shifts occur when people believe at a fundamental level

43:41.840 --> 43:44.840
in the efficacy around inclusive school cultures.

43:44.840 --> 43:47.840
When we talk about educational equity and equitable educators,

43:47.840 --> 43:51.840
we ensure at a baseline that our school environments are welcoming

43:51.840 --> 43:54.840
and wrought with care and joy.

43:54.840 --> 43:59.840
Board, I want you to know our schools will absolutely look different.

43:59.840 --> 44:01.840
You guys know that.

44:01.840 --> 44:04.840
Under the leadership of Dr. Brooks and Dr. Matheny,

44:04.840 --> 44:08.840
this partnership with SIPP and SBCSS through East Valley SOPA

44:08.840 --> 44:12.840
will allow us to ensure that they also feel different.

44:12.840 --> 44:16.840
Thank you for having me.

44:16.840 --> 44:17.840
Thank you so much.

44:17.840 --> 44:19.840
Really appreciate your time and sharing out.

44:19.840 --> 44:21.840
And it's been quite a journey.

44:21.840 --> 44:24.840
I know Kevin and I have just enjoyed working with all of you so much.

44:24.840 --> 44:27.840
And to the board, we really appreciate this opportunity to share.

44:27.840 --> 44:32.840
I'd like to pass it over back to you all.

44:32.840 --> 44:34.840
All right.

44:34.840 --> 44:41.840
Great. Thank you so much, Kevin, Kristen, Mindy, Heather, Patty Times, too,

44:41.840 --> 44:44.840
and Tarina for presenting here today.

44:44.840 --> 44:49.840
I'm just happy to always be in partnership and thank you for spending some time

44:49.840 --> 44:55.840
and, you know, really enjoy sort of walking through your journey with you here today.

44:55.840 --> 44:58.840
So, again, thank you so much.

44:58.840 --> 44:59.840
We can flip to the next slide.

44:59.840 --> 45:04.840
And really towards the back half of our presentation.

45:04.840 --> 45:13.840
So we'll talk a little bit about, first and foremost, I think one of the cornerstones of the SIPP in terms of requirements

45:13.840 --> 45:17.840
is really sort of engaging with our stakeholders and community.

45:17.840 --> 45:24.840
And so, you know, there have been sort of several efforts ongoing throughout the development

45:24.840 --> 45:29.840
and implementation of the SIPP in terms of really, really digging in deep with the community

45:29.840 --> 45:32.840
and dialoguing about the work that's occurring.

45:32.840 --> 45:41.840
And so one of the ways in which we have engaged our community is really through the innovative solutions work group.

45:41.840 --> 45:49.840
And so, you know, with the impact of COVID-19 creating those challenges across challenges for LEAs across the state,

45:49.840 --> 45:56.840
the CDE used this as an opportunity to engage those stakeholders to get the feedback on various topics

45:56.840 --> 46:00.840
related to students with disabilities, outcomes, distance learning.

46:00.840 --> 46:07.840
And so this was initiated by Superintendent Thurman to provide a practical guidance to teachers and administrators

46:07.840 --> 46:15.840
in order to support students and families in the shift to distance learning almost a year ago today.

46:15.840 --> 46:19.840
And so the CDE formed the innovative solutions work group.

46:19.840 --> 46:27.840
The work group had over 130 participants, consisted of parents and teachers, service providers, administrators,

46:27.840 --> 46:30.840
and representatives from other professional organizations.

46:30.840 --> 46:38.840
And throughout the meetings, the participants focused on specific topic areas

46:38.840 --> 46:48.840
and really sort of served as a think tank to really support and offer continuing improvement efforts during the time.

46:48.840 --> 46:54.840
And so some of the topics just included early childhood resources, least restrictive environment,

46:54.840 --> 47:00.840
mild and moderate intellectual, supporting some of the low incidence needs of our students as well,

47:00.840 --> 47:06.840
supporting parents and families, and of course providing and really brainstorming around mental health

47:06.840 --> 47:09.840
and mental health resources for our students as well.

47:09.840 --> 47:18.840
The second is really the CDE began broadcasting webinars every Thursday and covering again various topics

47:18.840 --> 47:21.840
similar to the ones that I mentioned above as well.

47:21.840 --> 47:29.840
And those webinars can still be accessed on the CDE website and still serve as I think a valuable resource across the state even now.

47:30.840 --> 47:40.840
We conducted a survey, and so the survey went out to every special education director and LEAs across the state

47:40.840 --> 47:47.840
really to gather feedback and was used to design some of those webinars and subsequent meetings as well.

47:47.840 --> 47:56.840
And it also helped serve as a guide for how CDE developed the guidance and resources available to the field in the time as well.

47:56.840 --> 48:02.840
And so of the LEAs that did respond to the survey, the results were actually equally distributed amongst

48:02.840 --> 48:09.840
really across the board in terms of geographic location, rural, urban, and LEA size.

48:09.840 --> 48:16.840
So it was a healthy mix and I think a good representation of our state as well.

48:16.840 --> 48:22.840
In terms of ongoing stakeholder engagement, the targeted engagement with stakeholders

48:22.840 --> 48:31.840
was in addition to some of the standard stakeholder engagement opportunities around the ESSEP, the statewide systems support as well.

48:31.840 --> 48:39.840
And so as in prior years, the opportunities include monthly meetings, conference calls with statewide SELPA,

48:39.840 --> 48:47.840
bimonthly meetings with our special education administrators of county offices, regular meetings

48:47.840 --> 48:53.840
with the California Advisory Commission on Special Education or AXE,

48:53.840 --> 48:59.840
and then obviously the state board meetings as well served as stakeholder engagement sessions.

48:59.840 --> 49:07.840
Next slide. In terms of just some long term next steps for us here at CDE,

49:07.840 --> 49:20.840
knowing that we still are faced with the challenges and also really the opportunities to really improve and progress with our system.

49:20.840 --> 49:29.840
Some of our long term next steps really focus and center on remaining engaged in the activities and the efforts

49:29.840 --> 49:34.840
related to the statewide system of support and the special education resources leads,

49:34.840 --> 49:40.840
much of what you heard today, and really maximizing those internal and external partnerships.

49:40.840 --> 49:46.840
The ESSEP, as stated before, will be submitted to those people first.

49:46.840 --> 49:57.840
Next slide. In terms of the immediate, and I think that for us here is really occupying a lot of brain space and manpower

49:57.840 --> 50:06.840
really to address and be responsive to LEA and student need still during this very, very critical stressful time for our community.

50:06.840 --> 50:14.840
And so our focus is to really ensure that IEPs and assessments are conducted and current for each student across California.

50:14.840 --> 50:22.840
And really the goal at CDE is really supporting LEAs in that process and ensuring that IEP teams

50:23.840 --> 50:37.840
and students are working towards relevant, timely and meeting goals and in making sure that system is in place so that high quality supports and services are still being delivered during this time and teams have accurate information.

50:37.840 --> 50:44.840
And as schools open in the fall, are fully open in the fall, students will need additional support.

50:44.840 --> 51:02.840
And so, you know, we'll be engaging again with the field to really learn, you know, topics that are surfacing and really circle back around on some of the guidance and webinars and things like that to provide, again, sort of updated resources and supports.

51:02.840 --> 51:07.840
Again, as we head into the fall months. Next slide.

51:07.840 --> 51:10.840
And in terms of the CDE approach, how will we get there?

51:10.840 --> 51:27.840
You know, our monitoring, we're going to pivot just a little bit and really focus on what we call really the building blocks or some foundational sort of best practices and really building high quality IEPs to support the needs of students.

51:27.840 --> 51:35.840
And we know the IEP is critical. It's a living document and it really provides the roadmap and the trajectory for student success.

51:35.840 --> 51:54.840
So really, really digging in and focusing with supports to our LEAs to really, you know, use relevant data, but also, you know, develop a plan that is actionable and meaningful for the student and can be implemented during this time will really be our focus as well.

51:54.840 --> 52:03.840
We'll continue to build those resources to support the LEAs with those assessments as well and service provision throughout the fall.

52:03.840 --> 52:11.840
As you may recall, we partnered with the California Association of School Psychologists to provide a webinar of assessments in COVID during this time.

52:11.840 --> 52:25.840
And so really ensuring that our community has the resources to conduct assessments, whether that be in person, whether that be hybrid or virtual, still will be an area of concern and focus for us as well.

52:25.840 --> 52:40.840
Positive behavior supports. Obviously, as more students transition back, we're looking at ways in which we can really provide supports in the field around, you know, positive behavior, pro-social behavior and working with our partners across the state to really establish

52:40.840 --> 52:48.840
you know, I think some guidance and resources that will be helpful as students, as more students transition back.

52:48.840 --> 53:08.840
And then continuing to collaborate with our technical assistance partners and really looking at teacher training, professional, paraprofessional training, English learning disabilities, but also, you know, not only continued collaboration, but also, I think, really, really focusing

53:08.840 --> 53:29.840
and accelerating some of those efforts given our timeframe. So, of course, that will keep us plenty busy. And of course, really excited to partner with our self-elites and our content leads to really move the work forward and really assist us through this critical time.

53:29.840 --> 53:42.840
And at this point, that concludes our presentation. And thank you so much. And thank you to our partners who were with us here today and happy to take any questions and go from there.

53:42.840 --> 53:52.840
Also, President Darling-Hammond, this item will require action. We do need approval from the board in order to move it to the U.S. Department of Education.

53:53.840 --> 54:07.840
Thank you so much, Heather and Shiloh and all of our California colleagues up and down the state. It was really wonderful to both get that thorough explanation and to get those inspiring examples from the field.

54:07.840 --> 54:20.840
I particularly appreciate the surviving to thriving metaphor that really speaks to us. We want to open the phone line for the public comment queue.

54:20.840 --> 54:36.840
So, if you could put up the public comment slide, that would be helpful. Thank you. And members of the public wishing to provide comments on the item can do so by calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the slide that's shown now.

54:36.840 --> 54:51.840
And while we're waiting for members of the public to call in, I want to ask Vice President Strauss, our special education liaison, if she has any initial comments. And then I'll ask if there are any clarifying questions before we go to public comment.

54:51.840 --> 55:12.840
So, Vice President Strauss. Okay. So, Heather and Shiloh, thank you so much for the thorough presentation that explained the process. I do think adding all the additional presenters with the work around the state really brings the theory to practice as to what we're trying to do.

55:12.840 --> 55:30.840
And I think we realize how important full, inclusive, effective practices are for our students with disabilities and all of our students. And I just so appreciate, particularly when you look at where the grant allocations are, they're far north, they're in the far south, they're in the center part of our state.

55:30.840 --> 55:46.840
We're a really big, diverse state. And I so appreciate hearing the voices of what you are doing in early childhood education, collaborating with teachers and leaders to really change culture and practice. And really, we're changing a whole system here.

55:46.840 --> 56:05.840
And I just so appreciate the process that the state is engaged in. It's a big shift to move. And I think investing in capacity and training clearly is what we need to do statewide. I do appreciate the identification of when districts were identified for differentiated assistance.

56:05.840 --> 56:17.840
I think Heather said it was 60 percent of the districts were identified in the special education subgroup. And so we know statewide that achievement with students with disabilities is a really critical issue.

56:17.840 --> 56:26.840
So all in all, I think this is a thorough process. It keeps us focused on the target of improving practice for all kids and for students with disabilities.

56:26.840 --> 56:43.840
And I think I just appreciate the coherent approach and connecting all the pieces. And for all the leaders out in the SELPAs and the districts that are doing this work, just thank you for the continued support to improve practice for special ed students.

56:43.840 --> 56:55.840
This was reviewed at the Advisory Commission on Special Ed. Lots of good support for the practice. And I just really appreciate the entire process and the update to the board. Thank you.

56:55.840 --> 57:10.840
Great. Are there any clarifying questions at this moment before we go to public comment? I'm not seeing any hands. So it was a very clear presentation, so we appreciate that.

57:10.840 --> 57:18.840
Seeing no clarifying questions, let's move to public comment.

57:18.840 --> 57:24.840
There are six people signed up for public comment. I will open the phone lines now.

57:24.840 --> 57:31.840
Good morning, caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute and your time starts now.

57:31.840 --> 57:43.840
Good morning. My name is Crystal Diaz and I am with Californians Together. As an organization representing English learners, we want to ensure that students receive the support they need and are appropriately identified for those supports.

57:43.840 --> 57:57.840
It is for this reason that we encourage the State Board of Education to encourage stronger monitoring by local education agencies and the proportionality of ELs and other subgroups identified as dyslexic to their percentage of the total student population.

57:57.840 --> 58:03.840
This information can help LEAs reflect on the efficiency of their identification and intervention strategies. Thank you.

58:03.840 --> 58:08.840
Thank you.

58:08.840 --> 58:27.840
Good morning. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute and your time starts now.

58:27.840 --> 58:42.840
Good morning, caller. Are you there?

58:42.840 --> 58:44.840
Yes. For me?

58:44.840 --> 58:50.840
Yes. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute and your time starts now.

58:50.840 --> 58:54.840
Carla Herrera.

58:54.840 --> 59:02.840
Good morning. I'm Carla Herrera, a biliteracy educator and advocate for over 45 years and former IQC member.

59:02.840 --> 59:18.840
As past vice chair of the subject matter committee during the framework development, I appreciate that you have heard and heeded suggestions on the literacy plan for children to become literate and fluent, including and especially English learners.

59:18.840 --> 59:33.840
However, I'm alarmed and concerned about the notion of universal. I'm sorry. Yes, this is for this is for we're currently taking public comment for item three, and I believe you would like to speak to towards item four.

59:33.840 --> 59:43.840
If you could just call you could call back in a little while. Thank you. My apologies. Thank you. Bye bye.

59:43.840 --> 59:58.840
Good morning. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute and your time starts now.

59:58.840 --> 01:00:05.840
That looks like that concludes public comment. We had a couple callers hang out.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:16.840
You're probably waiting for the next item. So, so I'd be glad to make a motion to approve the CD recommendation.

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:29.840
Okay, we can take a second and then have further discussion. So is there a second on that motion? I think it's member Rodriguez. Thank you. And now is there further discussion?

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:36.840
I remember Rodriguez. Did you have a comment?

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:42.840
Oh, you're on mute.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:53.840
Yes, thank you. Thank you so much for the wonderful presentation I love the statewide coordination to support inclusion.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:01:08.840
And I would also like to congratulate Dr. Trina betters, who was one of our presenters today. She was just recognized as a woman of the year for the California 23rd Senate district.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:18.840
So congratulations, Dr. Better. That is an accomplishment that's well deserved because you are you do amazing work.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:22.840
So congrats.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:31.840
Great. Thank you. And is there any further discussion of the motion?

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:36.840
I am. Oh, member Navo.

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:49.840
I just had a quick comment and quick two questions for the group. Obviously, I approve of the motion. I think I want to thank CD for doing such a wonderful job of explaining this. It was very clear.

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:59.840
You took something that's oftentimes very complicated and moved us through the process very easily in a way that is understandable and comprehensible. I appreciate that.

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:13.840
And appreciate our stakeholders who came in and shared as well, incredibly valuable information for the field to hear what's going on. There's so much work happening around LRE and inclusive opportunities for students with disabilities.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:30.840
My question is this. Maybe this is maybe for Heather and Shiloh, the first question. To what extent do you do you think that LRE will become a bigger part of the accountability conversation beyond just the ESSEP?

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:46.840
And then maybe for Kevin and Mindy and Kristen, to what extent is the training that you're doing leading to conversations around UDL?

01:02:46.840 --> 01:03:12.840
Thank you, board member Navo. In terms of the conversation of least restrictive environment, it is one that is always a topic that's on the table and is something that as CDE and LEAs look at our models of continuous improvement, wanting to always ensure that our students are afforded access and maximum access to the extent possible.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:27.840
And really looking at some of our LRE indicator data across the state, roughly 58% of our students are educated in a setting that puts them in a regular classroom at least 80% of the day.

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:56.840
18% are in a regular classroom at least 40% of the day and so on and so forth. And so really looking at the ways in which we can continue to provide that access, provide meaningful access for our students, I think will always be on the table and always be just a cornerstone of IDEA in terms of really providing that free, appropriate public education in an environment that will allow that student to grow.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:21.840
And not only grow, but also thrive. And that's really the goal. And so it is something that LRE cannot be solved in a day. And so really for us, it's an ongoing effort to really ensure, as stated before, that we are continuing to really push the envelope and really explore.

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:29.840
Really, again, providing innovative ways and access and exploring alternate pathways and pathways to success for our students.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:33.840
Thank you, Heather.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:50.840
And Board Member Navo, the Universal Design for Learning is central to our work on many levels. We've worked, up in Humboldt specifically, a year and a half ago before COVID, our team provided a day and a half in-person professional development opportunity for all the districts in the state.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:05:04.840
And we've been working with all the districts in Humboldt County around Universal Design for Learning. If you visit our website also, you'll see that we contract with Katie Novak and Andra Tisha Fritzgerald to provide Universal Design for Learning around equity and anti-racism.

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:11.840
Knowing that UDL cannot stay in the realm of special education, it has to be a tier one universal level of support.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:31.840
Our work is always focused on ensuring that general education teachers, site administrators, district administrators, as well as special education and related staff are availed to the opportunities that Universal Design for Learning provides around equitable outcomes and access for students.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:48.840
Yeah, and Member Navo, thank you, Kevin. I'm just going to piggyback on that because what's great about this whole system of collaboration and improving outcomes for students, all students, not just students with disabilities, is, you know, Kevin and Kristen and their team come in and provide really quality training and resources and ongoing support.

01:05:48.840 --> 01:06:00.840
And then through the SELPA office, through the County Office of Education, through the member districts of the SELPA, we can provide that coaching boots on the ground and follow up with Kristen and Kevin as resources as an educational leadership team.

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:10.840
So it's not the old traditional professional development, one and you're done. You know, go to a workshop and then put a book on a shelf. That is no longer how we're doing business and education.

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:20.840
We truly are partnering in collaboration and with the SELPAs providing the ongoing coaching through our state's state grants such as CAPTN and SIPP.

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:30.840
And Member Navo, just a note about UDL in general, that this goes back to what Kevin was sharing earlier in that this is an adult and systems readiness model. This is not a student readiness model.

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:38.840
So implementing UDL as a framework is not a toolkit. It's not a new curriculum that you purchase and disseminate and is hugely costly.

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:50.840
But you know, this is about learner variability from the outset and us as the educators and the adults doing the work behind the scenes to make sure that our kids are the most successful in the systems that we've created for them.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:07:00.840
So that's the heart of UDL. And as Kevin mentioned, it really is across everything that we do when we work with our districts and every piece of professional learning.

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.840
Thank you. That's wonderful to hear.

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:08.840
It was, you know, UDL was called out as a priority back in 2015 with the special education task force report.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:14.840
So it's so encouraging to hear that it's a priority in all of the work and you're seeing results.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:18.840
So thank you, Board President Garland-Hammond for allowing me the questions.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:29.840
Oh, sure. I want to add on to that. And I also see that Member Rucker is waiting, but I would like to piggyback since my question deals with this.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:47.840
As you noted, I'm thrilled that the special education task force report that Mike Hurst and I got going years ago is, you know, beginning to find its way into a universal system of education rather than two separate systems,

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:54.840
universal design for learning and work in the least restrictive environment being a key elements of that.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:08:17.840
I am curious to hear as we continue to try to move in this direction, what the insights from those of you who are expert in the field are with respect to the challenges we've had with credentialing and preparing teachers in special education.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:34.840
California has been far behind many other states in providing access to least restrictive environment because of the credentialing system that was adopted some years ago that eliminated the expectation for general credential before earning a special credential,

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:41.840
which then meant that those specialists could only teach in a restricted environment.

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:48.840
And so that created more segregation. We've been trying to move beyond that, but we have these teacher shortages.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:59.840
Two thirds of the people coming in to teach special education are not completed and in many cases have not begun any preparation to teach.

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:17.840
So there's a steep slope to help people learn the sophisticated practices of universal design for learning that require quite a bit of understanding of learning, development, curriculum, a wide repertoire of teaching and so on.

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:25.840
And I would love to hear what the advice is from those of us from those who are in the field.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:38.840
I know in Humboldt, there's a new teacher residency program preparing special educators from paraprofessionals who are moving into learning to become Ed specialists.

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:50.840
But I'm curious about other either reflections or strategies that are emerging as we try to deal with these issues.

01:09:51.840 --> 01:10:02.840
I think if I may, Chair Darling-Hammond, address that, and this is Mindy Fatig again, and absolutely the residency program has been fantastic in here.

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:12.840
As you know, we have a shortage California statewide, but especially it's difficult in our rural areas that need to attract people to the far rural parts of California.

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:18.840
I would say in two parts. I'm also an instructor in the special education graduate program at Humboldt State University.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.840
I'm an adjunct professor there for the last seven years.

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:34.840
And we've been really working with our general education counterpart at the State University in creating a trunk of classes, which I applaud CTC and your work in order to create those new credentialing requirements that are rolling out that we all have

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:44.840
common trunk of classes and understanding so that we can hopefully embed UDL is not just the thing that we have to learn or do, but it really is a culture and a mindset.

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:58.840
And in that for our teachers that we have now in the shortage, we're finding what's really effective is bringing in Kristen and Kevin and Patty and the captain work and really not just working with students who traditionally teach students with disabilities.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:03.840
But we are all in this together as one system, and we need to do our professional training together.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:07.840
We need to collaborate together because these are all of our kids.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:15.840
And so moving forward, I think the CTC credentialing is going to significantly help in our efforts of we are all here together serving kids.

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:22.840
And in the meantime, the work that the state grants have been doing locally with boots on the ground and creating that shift in cultural mindset.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:33.840
We've seen drastic differences in engagement from both the special educators and the general educators in providing quality UDL strategies for all students.

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:38.840
So I hope that addressed your questions from my perspective. Thanks.

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:47.840
I think in addition to that, the supporting inclusive practices projects works really closely with the Institutes of Higher Education and providing statewide training.

01:11:47.840 --> 01:12:03.840
Last May, we provided a universal design for learning training for student teachers as well as their supervisors and created a padlet of activities for student teachers who are unable to get their student teaching requirements met in the classroom setting.

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:14.840
As well as working closely with the CSU system, Dominguez Hills, UC Davis to ensure that universal design for learning is a framework that is part of the teacher training process.

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:26.840
And then we've also created an alignment chart between the TPEs and universal design for learning resources that's available to any student teachers or supervisors across the state.

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:29.840
That is great.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:44.840
And I do know that the governor's budget includes more resources for both teacher residencies and for Golden State teaching scholarships for special educators, as well as teachers in other shortage fields.

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:53.840
So we may be able to, with all of these efforts, turn the corner on this, but it's just a terrifically important area of work for us.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:59.840
We really appreciate your educating us about it this morning.

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:12.840
And President Darling-Hammond, if I may add, this is Patty Matheny in the East Valley SELFA. If I can share my personal perspective, as well as professional perspective, I came up in the early 1980s.

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:19.840
And in order to get a special education credential at that time, I also had to have a general education teaching credential.

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:31.840
And so I learned my pedagogy, I learned curriculum, I learned instruction in those classes, and I learned then how to modify and accommodate students with special needs via my special education credential.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:36.840
And so what I saw happening in the last 20 to 30 years is we moved away from that, right?

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:48.840
And so our current special education teachers, and this is where the change of mindset is the work we are doing in my region, truly believe they are not prepared to work with our students who have special needs.

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:59.840
And that's far from the truth. They have good basic instruction skills, they understand curriculum, they understand pedagogy, but we have created this silo system.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:06.840
And most of it was a result of the credentialing system to somehow help them to believe they can't do so.

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:12.840
And I think a lot of our work needs to be done with our current teachers who have that belief.

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:24.840
And if we can change that vision and work to have them understand the important value they provide to students with disabilities, I think we will help to move this needle.

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.840
Thank you. Appreciate it.

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.840
Member Rucker?

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.840
Thank you. Good morning to everyone.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:44.840
And I so appreciate and I always look forward to this particular presentation from the division to talk about not only the SSP, but the multiple dimensions for accountability.

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:48.840
I'm actually glad, Dr. Darling-Hammond, to follow your question.

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:58.840
When we talk about accountability, particularly in the special education system, we're actually looking at three dimensions almost at the same time.

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:09.840
First, we're looking at accountability to report status and data points about the performance of the program on meeting a particular state.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.840
Second, we're looking at accountability to report student outcomes.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:22.840
And that third piece is what you touched on, which was about the teacher credentialing or about the professional preparation of educators.

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:31.840
In a former life, I taught in the special education department at Sac State, and I taught those methods courses to special ed teachers.

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:39.840
So I'm always concerned when I hear that there seems to be a gap in the preparation of education professionals.

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:49.840
I think that what Dr. Brooks said about the purpose of these systems and the work that we're doing is about addressing the development and the work of the adults.

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:55.840
Students to support the performance and improvement of the students.

01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:06.840
So I become concerned when accountability discussions about special ed starts to focus in the state performance report about the percentage of students

01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:16.840
and how much general education or mainstreaming they're actually receiving rather than whether or not in the overall arc of the program,

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:22.840
we are actually delivering the program in a way that best meets the needs of the students.

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:32.840
So what I appreciated most from the presentation you all focused on today was the focus you provided to us about the overall outcomes,

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:45.840
not whether or not the work that districts are doing to meet the performance goal actually interferes with what should be placement decisions about the best needs of the students.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:56.840
So what I appreciate is in the way that you all have described the work of yourself as you are still continuing to focus on not just doing the work to address the performance goal,

01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:05.840
but to ensure that through the tools like the universal designs for learning and the other actions that you're providing in the professional development,

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:14.840
that the focus remains on ensuring that the programs deliver the best support and services to meet the needs of the students in the program.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:25.840
So this is accountability is really more an adult issue and an adult program performance issue than whether or not the students are placed to meet a professional performance goal.

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:32.840
So I really appreciate the way that you all carefully explain and drew that distinction.

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:38.840
Thank you. I think member Glover Woods had a hand up.

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:42.840
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond and good morning to everyone.

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:47.840
And thank you so much for just a very comprehensive and thorough presentation.

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:51.840
I'm just excited to see many of you who presented today.

01:17:51.840 --> 01:18:09.840
I did have a question or maybe even more of a statement as it relates to LRE and percentages of students that are able to benefit from being in a more inclusive practices environment.

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:24.840
So my wondering is, as it relates to the data, has there been opportunity to see how those that might be in more of a least restrictive environment or those that are in more inclusive classrooms,

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:41.840
how that plays out as it relates to our unduplicated people groups or student groups that have been disproportionately represented in special education or even geographically when we think about our districts that might be more urban or suburban or rural.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:56.840
I just wonder, again, knowing the benefit that those environments have for many students, how that plays out for students from different student groups as well as, again, geographically across our state.

01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:02.840
If it's not data that we've been looking at as of yet, I can definitely understand that.

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:10.840
And just encourage us to perhaps start to look at that as well as we continue moving forward with these important projects.

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:15.840
And thank you again so much for sharing this morning.

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:20.840
Thank you, Board Member Glover-Woods. I can speak a little bit to that.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:30.840
So under the requirements in the NIDEA, we are required to look at disproportionality by placement.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.840
And so least restrictive environment is one of those areas.

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:42.840
And so that really breaks down both race and ethnicity inside of a number of different categories for disproportionality.

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:52.840
And so that is something we have been examining and as part of both of our one year and three year calculation of disproportionality over the last several years.

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:57.840
So I think we have looked at it and we've seen some very interesting things.

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:02.840
We obviously see students of color who are typically in more restrictive placements.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:08.840
And I don't think that is a surprise based on our disproportionality discussions from January.

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:11.840
So that is sort of a trend we are seeing.

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:27.840
And I think the work that we're doing both with our equity project through the self-help content leads and through our TA provider SPP TAP is beginning to address some of those issues.

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:33.840
I notice a key area. As far as regional or even by disability, we have begun to kind of look at that.

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:37.840
And I will tell you how we're looking at it. And it will be interesting as we move forward.

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:43.840
So we're coming to the end of our six year APR cycle and we are going to need to set new targets.

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:52.840
And so with our stakeholder group, we did look at I believe by disability and I think regionally.

01:20:52.840 --> 01:21:02.840
And we're going to come back to you all in the fall to kind of walk through the targeting process that we set forth with the stakeholder group and look at some of that data.

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:13.840
So we can bring back some of that data around least restricted environment because we will need to set targets that are approved by this board for submission to the U.S. Department of Education this fall.

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:18.840
So we will be bringing that data to you for you to see.

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.840
Terrific. Thank you.

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:29.840
I think we have probably not exhausted our questions, but answered enough of them for the moment.

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:37.840
And so we really appreciate this presentation. It gives us a chance to really learn about and talk about something we all care very much about.

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:41.840
We have a motion on the table. We have a second for that motion.

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:47.840
And if there's no further discussion, I will ask Brooks to call the roll for a vote.

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:49.840
Member Sun.

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:51.840
Aye.

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.840

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:56.840
Yes.

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:57.840
Yes.

01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.840
Member Rodriguez.

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:01.840
Yes.

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:06.840
Member Fetillo-Brownson.

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.840
Member Navo.

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:09.840
Yes.

Member Fatah.

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:19.840
Yes.

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.840
President Darling-Hammond.

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:22.840
Yes.

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.840
Member Burr.

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:25.840
Aye.

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.840
Motion carries.

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:28.840
All right.

01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:35.840
With that, and because we are moving expeditiously, we've earned a 15-minute break.

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:38.840
So get a cup of coffee, whatever you need.

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.840
And we will see you back here.

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:45.840
Oh, let's be really generous and say 10 after 10.

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:46.840
17 whole minutes.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:48.840
Woohoo!

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:49.840
See you soon.

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:50.840
Don't leave the room.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:59.840
Just turn off your video and your microphone.

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:02.840
Brooks, could you please call the roll?

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:03.840
Of course.

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:09.840
Member Sun.

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:10.840
I apologize.

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:11.840
I was on mute.

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:12.840
Here.

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:13.840
No problem.

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:15.840
Vice President Strauss.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:16.840
Here.

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:20.840
Member Rucker.

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:21.840
Here.

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:23.840
Member Rodriguez.

01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:24.840
Here.

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:26.840
Member Petillo-Brownson.

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:27.840
Here.

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.840
Member Navo.

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:30.840
Here.

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:33.840
Member McQuillan.

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.840
Member Glover-Woods.

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:36.840
Here.

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:38.840
Member Fatah.

01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:39.840
Here.

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.840
President Darling-Hammond.

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:42.840
Here.

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:43.840
Member Burr.

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:44.840
Here.

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:46.840
We have a quorum.

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.840
Thank you.

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:49.840
Okay.

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:52.840
We're going to move on to item four.

01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:57.840
Item four is the Comprehensive Literacy State Development Grant.

01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:00.840
Here before us for approval.

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:07.840
The CDE recommends that the State Board approve the State Literacy Plan pending State Board

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:12.840
Executive Director approval of any final revisions requested by the SBE in correction

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:17.840
of any typographical errors, and this item will be presented by Barbara Murchison of

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:18.840
the CDE.

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:20.840
Nice to see you again, Barbara.

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:21.840
Please begin.

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:25.840
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond, Chief Deputy Gregson, Board Members.

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:30.840
I'm Barbara Murchison, Director of the Educator Excellence and Equity Division at the CDE.

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:36.840
And today it is my pleasure to present to you California's Comprehensive State Literacy

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:37.840
Plan.

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.840
Get going and share my screen.

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:51.840
And there we are.

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:55.840
So as President Darling-Hammond mentioned, today we are presenting the plan to you for

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:56.840
approval.

01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:01.840
The CDE recommends that the State Board of Education approve the State Literacy Plan,

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:06.840
but we made sure that the recommendation included some flexibility for us to be able to take

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:11.840
any final revisions you request today and integrate them into the plan, and then we'll

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:17.840
work with the Executive Director to make those changes and, of course, tidy up anything that

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:21.840
we might find before making it officially approved.

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:27.840
So as a reminder, the Comprehensive Literacy State Development Grant was an opportunity

01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:34.840
that we applied for back in June 2019, and we were awarded about $37.5 million later

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:35.840
that year.

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:40.840
The primary goal of this federal grant program is to improve literacy instruction for children

01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:43.840
and youth, birth through grade 12.

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:48.840
As part of the program, states are asked to develop, revise, or update their Comprehensive

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:56.840
Literacy Plans, so today we will be hopefully fulfilling one of the primary objectives of

01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:58.840
the federal grant program.

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:04.840
The program also provides states with the ability to provide targeted subgrants to

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:11.840
local educational agencies or LEAs to implement evidence-based programs to ensure high quality

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:14.840
literacy instruction.

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:18.840
We propose to do three things in our application.

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:24.840
First, we propose to establish dedicated staff within the CDE to coordinate the state's efforts

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:27.840
around literacy over the life of the project.

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:32.840
We've already hired one CDE staff member to work on this grant full-time, and we've identified

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:38.840
two others who are working on the grant halftime as California's in-kind contribution.

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:42.840
These staff have already established structures to support ongoing collaboration and information

01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:49.840
sharing around all of the department's literacy efforts, including monthly literacy roundtables

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:54.840
at the CDE, so that all of us who are working on various literacy initiatives can share

01:26:54.840 --> 01:27:01.840
what we're doing and ensure that our efforts are aligned and we're aligning various projects

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:06.840
as we can and potentially collaborating on some of them as appropriate.

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:12.840
We also meet monthly with our key partners, the California Subject Matter Project, California

01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:18.840
County Superintendents Educational Services Association, Region 15 Comprehensive Center

01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:25.840
at West Ed, and First 5 California to similarly share updates and brainstorm ideas around

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:29.840
how we can improve student literacy achievement.

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:34.840
The CDE staff supporting this literacy grant work will also have a much larger role in

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:40.840
coordinating the work of the subgrantees once we move to that stage of implementation later

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:42.840
this year.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:47.840
Our second objective, we propose to develop and implement an evidence-based comprehensive

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:52.840
state literacy plan that would align and integrate state literacy initiatives, the

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:57.840
content standards, and our various guidance documents to support educators who are teaching

01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:01.840
students and children from birth through grade 12.

01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:06.840
So that plan developed with stakeholders over the course of more than a year is why I'm

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.840
here today.

01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:15.840
And third, we propose to build local capacity to establish, align, and implement local literacy

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.840
initiatives that emphasize family and community involvement to address the needs of California's

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:23.840
most vulnerable children.

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:25.840
So that's the next stage of the work.

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:30.840
So I'm here talking to you about the plan today, but the vast majority of the funding

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:35.840
that California received will go to providing professional learning for teachers to help

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:38.840
them improve student achievement in literacy.

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:45.840
95% of the literacy grant funds, more than $35.5 million, will be subgranted to local

01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:48.840
educational agencies for that purpose.

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:56.840
I'll talk a little bit more about those grants and how the plan will guide them in a minute.

01:28:56.840 --> 01:29:01.840
So the purpose of this plan is really to align and integrate state literacy initiatives,

01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:06.840
content standards, and guidance documents to support teachers of students birth through

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:08.840
grade 12.

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:13.840
It is not meant to establish new guidance on curriculum or instruction in literacy.

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:18.840
California has formal processes in place to develop guidance on curriculum instruction,

01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:22.840
and we certainly didn't want to get sideways with any of that.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:26.840
The plan also does not include tools or templates.

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:29.840
These are going to be housed, well, some of them are already housed.

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:36.840
I'm excited to share with you today where we are housing resources, tools, and templates,

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:41.840
our new online literacy resource repository.

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:46.840
The plan is also designed to support continuous improvement of local literacy programs by

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:52.840
bringing coherence to the wealth of guidance, policies, resources, and systems that California

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:57.840
has in place to improve instruction and student achievement in literacy.

01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:03.840
So we know from our needs assessments and our ongoing work to support literacy instruction

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:09.840
that many of our colleagues in the field are either unaware of the resources available to them

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:15.840
or have difficulty accessing them or challenged to understand how all of the elements might

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.840
work together.

01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:23.840
There is a lot going on in California and trying to keep track of it to think about how the

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:29.840
various resources and policies and initiatives can work together to improve what's happening in

01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:35.840
a classroom is challenging, particularly for people who are running classrooms in schools and

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:37.840
districts all day.

01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:44.840
So we felt it was really important to try and bring that all together for folks in one place.

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:49.840
Our plan, of course, relies very heavily on California's common core state standards for

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:55.840
English language arts and literacy and our groundbreaking 2014 ELA-ELD curriculum framework,

01:30:55.840 --> 01:31:01.840
but it also organizes a variety of other key documents and policies such as the English Learner

01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:08.840
Roadmap Policy and the California Dyslexia Guidelines into a comprehensive literacy framework.

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:14.840
Finally, the plan models a continuous improvement process consistent with the continuous improvement

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:21.840
process that districts have been using to improve local outcomes and to inform their local control

01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:23.840
and accountability plans.

01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:28.840
So we wanted to make sure that our process was consistent with the process that our LEAs are

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:34.840
already using to think about continuous improvement.

01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:36.840
So it's been a bit of a road.

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:42.840
About a year ago we convened a group of 35 literacy experts to serve on the state literacy team.

01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:48.840
Members include teachers, school district and county office leaders, representatives from

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:55.840
professional associations, and multiple representatives with literacy expertise from higher education.

01:31:55.840 --> 01:32:00.840
Additionally, one member each from the State Board of Education, the Commission on Teacher

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:05.840
Credentialing, and the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence were included on the

01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:11.840
team to ensure that multiple state policy experts were on hand to help inform the conversation.

01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:17.840
The team engaged in an accelerated version of the start of the continuous improvement process,

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:23.840
discussing goals, reviewing data, and evaluating evidence-based literacy strategies to determine

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:28.840
which ones might be best applied to address our identified areas of need.

01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:34.840
After that meeting, CDE staff took the team's input to create a working draft of the plan.

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:42.840
Later that summer, we brought them back together for another two days to gather feedback on the updated draft.

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:47.840
After that second meeting of the literacy team, we made additional revisions to the draft and then

01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:52.840
brought the plan to the Instructional Quality Commission for its feedback and to open up a formal

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:54.840
public comment period.

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:59.840
In November, we brought the public comments and our recommended revisions to the plan based on

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:04.840
that comment to the IQC for approval.

01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:08.840
The IQC approved our recommendations and we updated the draft accordingly.

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:14.840
We presented that draft to you at your January meeting and received additional feedback from both you and

01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:16.840
stakeholders.

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:22.840
We've integrated that feedback into the latest draft that we're bringing to you for approval today.

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:28.840
So this version, crafted over a course of more than a year and with input from hundreds of literacy

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:34.840
experts and stakeholders from across the state, is what we are asking you to approve.

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:40.840
So I feel like I need to take a moment to express my gratitude to the state literacy team, an amazing group of

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:47.840
individuals, our partners both within and beyond the CDE, and everyone who made the time to provide public

01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:50.840
comments on the plan during the past year.

01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:54.840
All of these contributions have really strengthened the document.

01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:59.840
I also want to take a moment to thank the members of the educator excellence and equity team who have

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:03.840
been working on this plan and grant implementation for the past year.

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:08.840
Aline, Allison, Zaria, Jennifer, Joy, and Erica.

01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:15.840
Creating a state plan is exciting because it presents multiple opportunities to talk to a lot of different

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:19.840
people to learn more about what's really important to them.

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:25.840
And it's often an exercise in balancing what is required with what is possible.

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:31.840
And then working to organize all of that into a document that will actually be helpful to people.

01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:34.840
We experienced all of that with this plan.

01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:41.840
But since it was developed entirely online, this document presented a myriad of new challenges and

01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:45.840
opportunities to do things differently along the way.

01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:53.840
Aline, Jen, Joy, and Erica repeatedly rose to the occasion to create this document and to do a lot of

01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:56.840
other really exciting work around this grant.

01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:04.840
So many thanks to them for their hard work and innovative spirit throughout this last year.

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:07.840
A quick reminder regarding how the plan is organized.

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:12.840
We've got an executive summary providing a high-level overview of what's included.

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:18.840
And then the introduction includes background information on the federal grant program, the purpose

01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:24.840
and logic model, a section on how to read the plan, and information about California's diverse student

01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:25.840
population.

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:28.840
Then we get into the body of the document.

01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:34.840
Comprehensive and integrated literacy model helps us to meet our purpose of aligning and integrating

01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:40.840
state literacy resources and initiatives in order to demonstrate how they're connected and can be

01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:43.840
used in a coherent way.

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:51.840
Really, this section of the plan identifies resources as defining both what best first instruction is or

01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:56.840
as how these various resources can support best first instruction.

01:35:56.840 --> 01:36:02.840
The continuous improvement process section of the plan, which is a great deal of the document, goes

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:09.840
through each step of the continuous improvement process that the CDE used with its partners to assess

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:15.840
statewide literacy needs and develop a plan to leverage the grant funds to address those needs.

01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:21.840
It also includes a work cited section and a few appendices, including a glossary, data tables, and

01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:27.840
additional assessment results.

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:32.840
So thank you again to you and the stakeholders who provided additional feedback on the document in

01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:34.840
January.

01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:39.840
We've taken that feedback and used it to update this draft of the plan.

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:45.840
First, to clarify the comprehensive approach to English language development put forth in all of

01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:52.840
California's guidance documents, we've updated language throughout the plan in the statewide priorities to

01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:57.840
replace English language instruction with comprehensive English language development.

01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:03.840
Just to be very clear, when we're talking about English language instruction, we're talking about all of

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:06.840
the themes in the framework.

01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:13.840
We also heard the concerns expressed around the section describing universal screening.

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:19.840
We clarified the guidance on universal screening, including more information around appropriate timing

01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:24.840
and precautions around potential misdiagnosis of disabilities.

01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:31.840
I think this is a good time to reiterate that this plan does not contain any mandates or processes that

01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:34.840
schools are required to implement.

01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:38.840
These are recommendations that we've pulled from existing guidance documents.

01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:44.840
Consistent with continuous improvement process, we will be revisiting this plan regularly over the

01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:50.840
course of the grant and will update the guidance within both around universal screening as new

01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:51.840
guidance becomes available.

01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:57.840
And with other things, we anticipate that we'll have a new framework somewhere in the midst of our

01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:59.840
grant implementation.

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:06.840
So at that point, we will revisit the plan and make some adjustments as necessary.

01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:12.840
We also strengthen the language in the asset-based pedagogy section, including acknowledging widening

01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:18.840
achievement gaps and the value of culturally sustaining pedagogy, in particular for communities of

01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:25.840
color, and we added language to the grade 6-12 statewide priority section regarding structured

01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:30.840
literacy interventions for older students.

01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:37.840
A lot of board conversation in January revolved around what our subgrantees would be expected to do,

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:43.840
so we took that feedback and updated the plan to provide a bit more clarity on that topic.

01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:50.840
So all grantees will be required to implement programs aligned to the comprehensive and integrated

01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:57.840
literacy model, which means leveraging all the key themes in the ELA-ELD framework and all strands of

01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:00.840
the Common Core for ELA literacy.

01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:07.840
All of the grantees will be required to support teacher understanding and implementation of

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:14.840
culturally relevant and sustaining pedagogies, and will also support implementation of evidence-based

01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:17.840
family literacy strategies.

01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:23.840
And consistent with our federal grants objectives, all grantees will be required to focus on the needs

01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:30.840
of historically underserved students, including children living in poverty, English learners,

01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:36.840
children with disabilities, and children of color.

01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:43.840
Grantees will also support LEAs to develop and implement local literacy plans, will be required to

01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:48.840
define, measure, and report relevant metrics, and will be expected to make appropriate course

01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:52.840
adjustments if defined metrics are not being met.

01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:59.840
So we will ensure that all of that is very clearly outlined in the request for applications that we

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:04.840
hope to release relatively soon.

01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:11.840
So consistent with federal requirements, again, we're going to have seven, we're hoping to select,

01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:16.840
we're planning, we're not hoping, we're planning to select seven local literacy lead agencies across

01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:18.840
the state.

01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:21.840
This will be county offices.

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:28.840
Consistent with federal requirements, the birth through age five lead will receive 15% of the funding.

01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:32.840
There will be one lead for that group of students or children.

01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:39.840
The three transitional kindergarten to grade five leads will receive 40% of the funding, and the

01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:45.840
three grade six to grade 12 leads will receive 40% of the funding.

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:50.840
Subgrants to the local literacy lead agencies will support the implementation and study of evidence

01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:57.840
based strategies to address the statewide literacy priorities identified in the plan and support the

01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:01.840
literacy needs of economically disadvantaged and high need students.

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:08.840
To be very clear, the comprehensive literacy state development grant priority, and this is the federal

01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:15.840
priority and our priority as well, is improving student outcomes by improving classroom instruction.

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:21.840
Subgrantees are going to have some latitude in their applications to describe which evidence based

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:27.840
strategies they will leverage to improve literacy instruction for the particular group of students

01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:34.840
that they're serving and for the particular priority they want to go deep with, but ultimately providing

01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:41.840
high quality teacher professional learning to improve classroom instruction is the focus of this grant.

01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:48.840
Seven county offices are going to be selected to do this deep work around the priorities in the plan, and

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:54.840
the CDE is going to elevate what they learn and the resources they develop to the statewide system of

01:41:54.840 --> 01:42:04.840
support so that everyone has access to the information that they are learning.

01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:13.840
So at this point, I want to share with you some of the resources the CDE has already developed or collected

01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:18.840
to support professional development and professional learning around literacy instruction statewide.

01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:25.840
We call our big objective here, beyond the plan and beyond creating some coherence by bringing on a couple

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:31.840
of additional staff, is really to build state and local capacity to support high quality literacy

01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:41.840
instruction. So as promised, we have been building out a literacy resources repository in a new space

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:51.840
called California Educators Together. I'm going to cross my fingers, Zoom willing, I'll get us to the site.

01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:59.840
It's just been up for a few days. So once we get there, we'll see some interesting things, I'm sure.

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:06.840
Last time we were together, I mentioned that we were building out sets of videos with our state literacy team.

01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:12.840
Our state literacy team had volunteered to help us come up with evidence-based resources.

01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:20.840
Let's see if we can get there this way. If not, we'll try and get there another way.

01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:32.840
All right. So hopefully you can see we are loading California Educators Together.

01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:41.840
Can you all see this on your screen? All right. I'm going to keep going. If you can't see it, let me know.

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:49.840
Here's our brand spanking new California Educators Together literacy resources repository.

01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:57.840
And you can get to this from our main comprehensive literacy state development grant web page.

01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:03.840
I'll have a reminder of how to get there in a bit. But you can see we've started to compile some.

01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:07.840
I think it's not showing on our screens, Barbara. OK, let me try another way.

01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:16.840
I'm still seeing your slide. Thank you for letting me know. I'm going to try another way.

01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:24.840
Because I would have just kept talking. All right, now you can see it. Can you not?

01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:29.840
Thank you. I see member Rucker nodding. Thank you. All right.

01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:35.840
So here we are at our brand new literacy resources repository.

01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:48.840
And I'm just going to show you a couple of highlights and encourage you and anyone else who's interested in using all of these cool things after our time together.

01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:56.840
But you can see we've organized things in a variety of ways. First, we have our birth through age five resources.

01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:02.840
Then we've got our transitional kindergarten through grade five resources.

01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:16.840
Then we've got our grade six through twelve resources. So we've organized them in collections by grade band, because, again, this grant is is organized by grade bands.

01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:26.840
And what I want to do is just go into the birth through age five resource collections just a bit so you can take a look at how we've got that together.

01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:38.840
You can see we've got a collection of resources to support assessment practices, a collection around asset based pedagogy, a collection around best first instruction,

01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:50.840
a collection around family community engagement, professional learning and coaching, supporting English learners, supporting students with disabilities and students who are struggling to read.

01:45:50.840 --> 01:46:05.840
So these are all priorities that are called out in the grant document. So I was a little nervous when I'm sharing new collections in real time.

01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:25.840
But even, you know, and again, these resources have been curated by the state literacy team either suggested or reviewed and curated to be of high quality to make sure because we know that managing resources is a challenge for folks.

01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:35.840
So much out there. So we wanted to make sure that what we were offering was looked at pretty closely reviewed by the state literacy team and CDE staff.

01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:46.840
So in our asset based pedagogy collection for the birth through age five grade band, you can see there are a couple of articles, there are documents, there are websites.

01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:59.840
I know it's a huge priority to us to think in particular around, you know, how are we supporting our students with from African American backgrounds.

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:12.840
And you can see we've we've with an eye for that. There are a few resources just in here for the zero to five group focused just on that.

01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:26.840
See if I can get back supporting English learners for the zero to five group. We've got another collection.

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:40.840
And there are just a couple of resources in there. Again, just getting started wanting to make sure that what we offer in this website is is looked at closely and we believe it to be evidence based and of high quality.

01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:45.840
So I'm not going to click on all of these things because you've got a busy day.

01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:53.840
But I just wanted to give you a little preview of how we've got those collections for those grade spans.

01:47:53.840 --> 01:48:03.840
Last time we were together I told you we were working with our state literacy team to build out this knowledge building video series.

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:08.840
This one's just the intro, but I want to show you this one.

01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:25.840
Dr. Marianne Wolf, who is the director of UCLA Center for Dyslexia, Diverse Learners and Social Justice and kind of an international expert on dyslexia and how students learn how to read, also is a member of our state literacy team.

01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:27.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:29.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:31.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:33.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:35.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:37.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:39.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:41.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:43.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:45.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:47.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:49.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:51.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:53.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:55.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:57.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:48:57.840 --> 01:48:59.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:01.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:03.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:05.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:07.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:09.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:11.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:13.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:15.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:17.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:19.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:21.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:23.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:25.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:27.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:29.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:31.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:33.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:35.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:37.840
We've got a couple of resources in there.

01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:42.500
I don't put together who most of the

01:49:48.980 --> 01:49:50.040
But you know, the California dyslexia initiative

01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:51.040
is getting up and running.

01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:51.800
But you know, the California dyslexia initiative is getting

01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:53.140
And there's ongoing work.

01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:55.140
There's ongoing work.

01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:56.740
I believe the educator workforce investment without

01:49:56.740 --> 01:50:00.340
I believe the educator workforce investment grant

01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:00.840
for special education also focuses on dyslexia.

01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:02.340
for special education also focuses on dyslexia.

01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:03.840
So土 People have questions about how all of this

01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:06.680
and I anticipate that this will be a place

01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:08.120
where we can share resources

01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:10.360
from across all of those initiatives.

01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:14.640
So here you have a rather large collection

01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:23.080
of videos around integrated and designated ELD

01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:28.760
developed by the California Department of Education.

01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:30.920
And it's quite a lovely series

01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:33.600
broken down by various grades

01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:38.480
around how you can support English language development.

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:41.680
And these two collections

01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:44.560
are from the Educator Workforce Investment Grant.

01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:48.400
So our colleagues at CAST have been doing that work

01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:51.560
and they have been creating materials.

01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:55.160
We have them in our Knowledge Building Collection as well.

01:50:56.540 --> 01:50:59.040
So again, there's a lot to see here.

01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:01.120
It is in development.

01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:04.120
I think you may be the very first public showing

01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:05.920
of California Educators Together

01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:07.240
and certainly the first showing

01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:11.800
of our new literacy resources collection.

01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:14.960
That's the last thing I wanna show you here

01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:19.520
because we did hear from folks, the state plan looks fine.

01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:22.760
How does this work for local educational agencies?

01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:25.400
And I was like, oh, we're working on that.

01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:26.960
The way we're working on that

01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:31.400
is we've built out this local literacy planning toolkit.

01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:36.400
So that is also on California Educators Together.

01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:43.000
And this toolkit is

01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:48.440
designed to help LEAs

01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:51.000
think about their own literacy planning

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.960
in a way that's aligned to the state literacy plan.

01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:56.360
The toolkit will also be

01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:58.960
on the California Department of Education webpages

01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:01.600
so people can find it there as well.

01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:03.760
As we mentioned, our subgrantees

01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:08.200
will be supporting districts in their regions

01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:11.620
to do some literacy planning of their own.

01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:16.800
And this is not required that people use these materials,

01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:19.560
but we built out this set of tools

01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:21.280
so that folks can build

01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:27.640
can engage in a continuous improvement process

01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:30.520
around literacy in a way that's parallel

01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:32.880
to how we have done it at the state

01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:34.600
to build our literacy plan.

01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:40.360
So with that, oh, I forgot to show you one more thing,

01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:42.920
but I'll just tell you at the very bottom

01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:46.280
of the collection,

01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:50.680
we do have a set of research articles

01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:54.000
that we've asked our colleague, Dr. Linda Friedrich,

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.840
who is the Director of Literacy at WestEd

01:52:56.840 --> 01:53:00.040
to help us identify some really high leverage

01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:03.240
kinds of literacy research

01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:06.240
so that we can build out kind of a library of research

01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:10.120
around how to support literacy across the grade spans.

01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:12.800
And we have that in a separate collection as well.

01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:15.760
So thanks to her for helping us too.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:19.840
So,

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:24.840
hopefully, okay, let's go PowerPoint.

01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:28.800
Here we are.

01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:31.880
So once the plan is approved,

01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:34.480
we'll get to work identifying our subgrantees.

01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:36.840
We will continue to build out resources

01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:40.800
in our resources repository in a continuous manner

01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:42.600
throughout the life of the grant.

01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:45.120
Again, as our subgrantees are learning

01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:46.520
and building out resources,

01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:49.000
they too will go into the repository.

01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:55.640
But now the work begins of identifying our subgrantees.

01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:00.480
We are planning to make that RFA available by May

01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:03.040
and to grant the awards by September.

01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:05.720
We want to accelerate that timeline,

01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:07.960
potentially releasing the RFA next month

01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:10.120
and awarding the funds in August.

01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:11.920
But as circumstances evolve,

01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:15.480
we continue to consider how this grant is gonna intersect

01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:17.600
and support all of the other investments

01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:19.280
that are happening with student literacy.

01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:21.560
So we'd prefer to take a little more time

01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:23.080
to think that through than to rush

01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:25.440
to get the RFA out the door.

01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:28.840
Right now, we're thinking about this large influx of funding

01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:30.360
that is coming to our LEAs

01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:32.880
from both state and federal governments

01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:34.480
to address student learning needs

01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:37.040
that may have intensified during the past year.

01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:39.080
I think a lot of folks are worrying

01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:44.080
about how to invest those funds wisely.

01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:46.800
So we're thinking about how we might encourage

01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:48.960
those who apply for this grant opportunity

01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:51.880
to braid various funding resources,

01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:53.760
to amplify or expand the work

01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:57.880
that they will be proposing to do as a local literacy lead.

01:54:57.880 --> 01:54:59.800
But again, our guiding principle here,

01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:03.440
we are driven to ensure that our literacy efforts

01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:06.440
are coherent and evidence-based.

01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:10.840
So here's just a little reminder

01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:14.880
that all interested parties can find much more information

01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:16.680
around the Comprehensive Literacy

01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:18.800
State Development Grant Program

01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:22.160
and information about how the plan was developed

01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:25.520
on the CDE CLSD webpage.

01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:26.880
This week, we added the link

01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:29.880
to our online resources repository there.

01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:33.320
So people who want to go into that collection and explore

01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:34.920
can find the link there.

01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:39.480
And as always, we encourage everyone to join our listserv

01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:42.280
to stay looped in as the work continues.

01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:46.680
And if anyone has questions about the grant at any point,

01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:51.120
our email is clsdp at cde.ca.gov.

01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:56.000
So with that, here is our recommendation.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.840
Today, we are seeking your approval of the plan,

01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:02.240
pending final approval of the board executive director

01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:06.400
of any revisions that you might request today.

01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:09.080
At this time, I'd be happy to respond

01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:10.760
to any questions you might have.

01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:14.000
Thank you so much.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.720
We're going to get ready to queue up for public comment.

01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:19.920
Then we'll ask clarifying questions,

01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:23.480
then we'll hear comments and come back for discussion.

01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:27.840
So here is the public comment information

01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:29.280
and we'll open that queue.

01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:32.120
Members of the public wishing to provide comment

01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:34.440
may call the telephone number

01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:37.520
and use the access code provided on the slide.

01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:39.720
And while we're waiting for members of the public

01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:42.520
to call in, I'll ask Vice President Strauss

01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:45.400
as our liaison, if she has any initial comments.

01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:49.280
And then we'll see if there are any clarifying questions

01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:51.120
before we turn to public comment.

01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:56.880
So let me just say, this has been a really thoughtful,

01:56:56.880 --> 01:57:00.680
long process that began at the end of March,

01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:03.520
just as we had the shutdown in 2020.

01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:07.360
So as Barbara said, this was done completely remotely.

01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:09.880
And from the beginning, it has been,

01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:13.960
the team has been so thoughtful, so thorough.

01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:16.280
And I just have to commend Barbara and the CDE team

01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:19.800
for being open to the diverse stakeholder inputs.

01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:21.720
My understanding from all the stakeholders

01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:24.080
is that CDE has been listening,

01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:27.520
they've updated the plan and has been very responsive.

01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:29.640
And I think it's really exciting to see,

01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:31.080
and I appreciate that districts

01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:32.880
are going to be getting other funding,

01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:37.600
but $35 million to continue our work statewide

01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:39.480
to improve literacy for students

01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:42.680
and improve capacity is very exciting.

01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:45.480
I appreciated Barbara sharing with us the website

01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:47.520
with the modules and the videos,

01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:51.640
which I think will continue to support educators.

01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:54.840
And while this only goes to seven county offices

01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:56.800
that will then work with districts,

01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:00.720
I think it has benefits of our long-term commitment

01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:03.320
to improving teacher capacity

01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:05.680
to support literacy throughout the state.

01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:09.360
And I appreciated some focus on designated ELD

01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:11.160
as well as integrated ELD,

01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:15.360
which is a highlight of our ELA ELD framework,

01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:18.960
but we know still needs continued support of teachers

01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:20.440
to have the right strategies.

01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:23.920
So again, I so appreciate it.

01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:25.560
And I just want to remind everyone,

01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:28.040
there's no new requirements in this plan,

01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:30.160
and there's no funding conditions for LEAs

01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:34.640
to benefit from support from the literacy lead agencies.

01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:36.120
I also appreciate the coordination

01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:39.120
that the role of CDE will do in this process,

01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:42.320
and just appreciate the thorough process

01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:45.160
to get this plan as a guidance document

01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:48.000
to improve literacy for all of our students.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:48.820
Thank you.

01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:54.480
Great, and it's also very exciting to see the new website.

01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:58.240
So thank you for sharing that as well.

01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:00.640
Really great to see that.

01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:04.120
Are there any clarifying questions from members of the Board

01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:05.920
before we go to public comment?

01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:09.520
I'm not seeing any hands.

01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:12.880
Therefore, we'll see if we have public commenters.

01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:16.000
There are currently 18 people signed up

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.560
in the queue for public comment.

01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:19.160
I will open the phone lines now.

01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:22.600
Good morning, State Board of Education.

01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:24.800
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:25.680
You have one minute.

01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:26.960
Your time starts now.

01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:28.800
Good morning, State Board of Education.

01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:29.640
Go ahead.

01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:34.560
Go ahead, caller.

01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:36.640
Meagan Potente, Meagan Potente,

01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:39.640
Co-State Director for Decoding Dyslexia, California.

01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:42.360
The language added on pages 86 through 90

01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:45.160
wrongly conflates special education eligibility

01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:47.640
with screening for risk of dyslexia.

01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:50.640
The goal of screening is not to diagnose dyslexia

01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:52.040
as a risk of dyslexia,

01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:55.080
but to address dyslexia as a risk of dyslexia.

01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:58.520
Screening is not to diagnose students with dyslexia.

01:59:58.520 --> 02:00:01.240
Screening identifies students who may be at risk

02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:03.640
of experiencing difficulty with reading

02:00:03.640 --> 02:00:05.720
and may need more instruction.

02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:08.280
This is made clear in the ELA ELD framework

02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:10.480
and the California Dyslexia Guidelines

02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:14.240
that the paragraphs added to the SLP confuse screening

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:17.320
with evaluation for special education eligibility.

02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:20.480
Describing exclusionary criteria under which a student

02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:23.480
may not be considered as having a learning disability

02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:26.520
is not relevant where it was added to the SLP.

02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:28.800
Including this language here sends the message

02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:31.440
that students need special ed eligibility

02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:34.280
before they can access targeted reading support,

02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:37.160
which is counter to federal and state guidance

02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:39.120
on early intervention.

02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:43.760
DDCA does not support the addition to the SLP as described.

02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:45.560
Thank you, caller, your time is up.

02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:49.840
Good morning, State Board of Education.

02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:52.120
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:54.160
You have one minute, your time starts now.

02:00:57.840 --> 02:00:59.400
Hi, my name is Rachel Heard

02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:00.480
and I am a school board member.

02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:01.320
Goodbye.

02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:07.160
Go ahead, caller.

02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:08.080
We get her back.

02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:15.560
Go ahead, caller.

02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:19.040
You're live.

02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:19.880
Can you hear me?

02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:22.960
Yes.

02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:27.600
Good morning, State Board of Education.

02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:29.720
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:30.760
Your time starts now.

02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:31.760
You have one minute.

02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:42.720
We're having some phone difficulties at the moment.

02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:47.520
We are going to take a quick break here

02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:49.440
while we get that situated.

02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:55.640
We just need one moment to reconnect the phone line.

02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:02.840
We will simply wait.

02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:22.960
Okay.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:54.160
Good morning, caller.

02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:55.000
Are you there?

02:02:57.120 --> 02:02:58.440
Hello?

02:02:58.440 --> 02:02:59.600
Hi, you're live.

02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:01.080
Please go ahead and state your name

02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:02.480
and affiliation for the record.

02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:04.720
You have one minute and your time starts now.

02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:06.720
I am Lori DePole.

02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:09.680
Students with dyslexia are general education students first

02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:12.160
and the majority of them will not be found eligible

02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:14.400
for special education services.

02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:17.440
In MTSS, universal screening occurs in tier one

02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:19.200
as a critical first step

02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:21.760
to early identification of students

02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:24.560
who are at risk and who may need more instruction.

02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:26.600
The newest change to the state literacy plan

02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:29.920
made under universal screening on pages 86 to 87

02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:34.120
and 89 to 90 confuse special education eligibility

02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:35.560
and the exclusionary factors

02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:38.000
in determining special education eligibility

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:39.960
with universal screening.

02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:42.000
ESSA requires screening of all students

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:43.960
under a comprehensive literacy plan

02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:46.560
and does not require sped eligibility

02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:49.200
or sped exclusionary factors as a further hurdle

02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:51.080
for determining students who are at risk

02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:54.480
and need appropriate early MTSS intervention.

02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:56.920
We respectfully request that this language be removed

02:03:56.920 --> 02:03:59.120
as it is misleading and it does not align

02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:01.560
with state adopted ELA ELG framework

02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:03.400
regarding universal screening

02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:05.480
or the California dyslexia guidelines.

02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:06.520
Thank you.

02:04:06.520 --> 02:04:07.360
Thank you.

02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:11.640
Good morning.

02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:13.720
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:15.960
You have one minute and your time starts now.

02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:23.640
Good morning, caller.

02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:25.840
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:28.200
You have one minute and your time starts now.

02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:41.320
My name is Rachel Heard and I'm a school board member.

02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:43.800
It's frustrating to hear that despite so much talk

02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:48.120
about the importance of early intervention, RTI, MTSS,

02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:50.760
so many students who need help with foundational skills

02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:53.880
don't get the help they need until they're years behind

02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:55.760
and the most opportune and efficient time

02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:57.800
for intervention for them is gone.

02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:00.520
It's critical that the concept of universal screening

02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:02.800
in this plan be clearly separated

02:05:02.800 --> 02:05:05.560
from formal assessment for special education

02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:09.000
to avoid the continued confusion expressed

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:13.080
by some other callers who are advocating

02:05:13.080 --> 02:05:14.800
for Californians together.

02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:18.320
It needs to be clear what universal screening is

02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:19.560
and is not for.

02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:23.080
It also needs to be clear to anyone using this plan

02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:25.800
that students with dyslexia can and should be served

02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:27.560
in general education.

02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:30.040
Certainly, some may need federal education,

02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:33.360
but the irony and reality is that many who don't qualify

02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:36.440
for special ed end up in a no man's land of need

02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:38.000
with no help at all.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.280
I urge you to approve the plan,

02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:42.640
but please remove the language that has been.

02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:44.400
Thank you, caller, your time is up.

02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:47.800
Good morning.

02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:49.760
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:50.600
You have one minute.

02:05:50.600 --> 02:05:51.680
Your time starts now.

02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:01.680
Good morning, caller.

02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:03.720
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:04.760
Your time starts now.

02:06:04.760 --> 02:06:05.800
You have one minute.

02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:06.640
Good morning.

02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:08.920
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:09.760
You have one minute.

02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:11.040
Your time starts now.

02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:14.400
My name is Martha Hernandez,

02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:17.080
the Executive Director of Californians Together.

02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:19.040
I would like to thank Barbara Murchison,

02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:21.000
the committee and CD staff

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:24.200
for incorporating stakeholder input and feedback.

02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:26.000
There are numerous positive updates

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.800
and feedbacks that we've been receiving

02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:29.040
from the board of directors,

02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:30.040
from the board of directors,

02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:31.040
from the board of directors,

02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:32.040
from the board of directors,

02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:33.040
from the board of directors,

02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:34.040
from the board of directors,

02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:36.840
there are numerous positive updates to the plan

02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:39.280
and are very appreciative of the improvements made

02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:41.640
since the January state board meeting,

02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:44.280
including but not limited to the updated language

02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:45.720
and the statewide priorities

02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:48.240
to replace English language instruction

02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:50.880
with comprehensive English language development.

02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:52.960
The clarification that each grantee,

02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:55.560
regardless of statewide priority focus,

02:06:55.560 --> 02:06:58.120
will be required to implement programs

02:06:58.120 --> 02:07:00.680
that integrate all five key literacy themes

02:07:00.680 --> 02:07:02.680
of the ELA ALD framework.

02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:06.800
The stronger language in the assets-based pedagogy section,

02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:09.080
including acknowledging the value of culturally

02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:11.520
and linguistically responsive teaching

02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:13.800
and clarification regarding guidance

02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:16.160
on universal screening for dyslexia,

02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:19.080
including precautions against the misdiagnosis

02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:21.400
of disabilities for English learners.

02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:22.560
Thank you.

02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:23.400
Thank you.

02:07:26.720 --> 02:07:28.360
Good morning, state board of education.

02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:30.440
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:31.480
You have one minute.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:34.600
Hi, my name is Christy Dennis

02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:36.120
and I'm the parent of two students

02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:38.240
with dyslexia in Los Angeles.

02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:39.840
When my first child began school,

02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:42.200
we had no idea that he would have trouble learning.

02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:43.520
He was bright and sociable

02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:44.840
and his preschool teacher told us

02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:46.400
that he would succeed anywhere.

02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:47.920
But only a few months into kindergarten,

02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:49.200
we began receiving reports

02:07:49.200 --> 02:07:51.400
that he's far behind his peers in reading.

02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:53.920
To complicate matters, our family is fully bilingual

02:07:53.920 --> 02:07:55.720
and he was attending a bilingual school,

02:07:55.720 --> 02:07:59.040
so his struggles were attributed to his bilingual status

02:07:59.040 --> 02:08:01.440
rather than identified as a learning disability.

02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:03.520
We were repeatedly told that delays are normal

02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:04.960
and we should just be patient.

02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:07.200
It took five years to get him properly diagnosed

02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:08.080
and due to that delay,

02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:10.760
he's still far behind his peers today in high school.

02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:13.600
Universal screening would have changed his life profoundly.

02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:15.720
Bilingual students like my sons are just as likely

02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:17.160
as their peers to have dyslexia

02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:18.880
and I fear that any efforts to exclude them

02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:21.160
from a rigorous and targeted screening process

02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:23.760
would miss opportunities for them to get the help they need.

02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:25.680
In fact, they are perhaps the ones most in need

02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:27.040
of the screening because their status

02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:29.000
as English language learners makes it more difficult

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.280
to identify their reading disabilities.

02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:32.960
Furthermore, the method of instruction

02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:34.240
that works for dyslexic students

02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:35.440
also works for all students.

02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:36.280
Thank you, Caller, your time is up.

02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:38.160
Otherwise, it would not be advantageous.

02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:39.160
Thank you, Caller.

02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:43.920
State Board of Education,

02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:45.680
name and affiliation for the record.

02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:47.840
You have one minute, your time starts now.

02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:50.360
Yes, my name is Katherine Christo,

02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:53.520
professor emeritus at Sacramento State University.

02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:55.160
I am concerned about additions

02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:57.600
to the state literacy plan added this month,

02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:00.160
particularly the paragraph inserted

02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:02.840
into the section labeled supporting students,

02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:06.120
subhead universal screening on page 86.

02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:09.360
The added paragraph that begins California's regulations

02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:10.800
pertinent to identification

02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:13.160
of a specific learning disability

02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:17.000
goes on to discuss qualifications for special education.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:21.040
This is not relevant to the purpose of universal screening,

02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:23.280
which is what this section is about.

02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:26.240
The presence of this paragraph regarding special education

02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:29.920
in this section is confusing and will lead to readers

02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:31.960
assuming that universal screening

02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:35.320
is a function of special ed, which it is not.

02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:38.360
On the contrary, screening is a general ed function

02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:41.800
and the first step in any MTSS program.

02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:45.360
I urge the board to remove this and similar paragraphs,

02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:47.680
which will leading them there will only contribute

02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:49.640
to misunderstanding around the purpose

02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:51.200
of universal screening.

02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:53.640
Thank you, Caller, your time is up.

02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:55.240
Strong within this document.

02:09:58.040 --> 02:09:59.560
Good morning, State Board of Education,

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:01.520
please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:02.800
Your time starts now.

02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:06.400
Good morning, my name is Lynn Scott.

02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:08.640
I'm a professor at Cal State East Bay.

02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:12.000
My research is in early child language development

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.360
and literacy.

02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:15.680
Moving the time for dyslexia screening

02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:17.560
to the spring of first grade

02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:19.800
to allow for sufficient literacy instruction

02:10:19.800 --> 02:10:21.600
to be able to identify those students

02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:24.440
struggling with reading is urgent.

02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:28.200
Moving this recommendation so that it focuses on children

02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:32.880
with special needs and children that are at risk

02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:34.880
is what is critical in this.

02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:38.640
Using limited instructional time and resources

02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:42.240
for universal screening or screening of all students

02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:45.920
will not target and benefit those most at need.

02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:49.720
Those students who read well meet grade level

02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:52.400
reading standards and or meet local benchmarks

02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:54.200
or other formative reading assessments

02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:56.360
do not need to be assessed.

02:10:56.360 --> 02:10:59.080
Again, valuable instructional time will be lost

02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:01.280
on assessing every student

02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:04.840
rather than targeting those students at risk.

02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:06.040
Thank you.

02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:06.880
Thank you.

02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:10.120
Good morning, please state your name

02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:11.520
and affiliation for the record.

02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:14.280
You have one minute, your time starts now.

02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:15.840
Good morning, my name is Michelle Perry.

02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:17.440
I'm a special education advocate

02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:19.560
and parent of a child with dyslexia.

02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:21.600
My comment today is regarding universal screening

02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:23.000
for dyslexia.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:24.920
We cannot continue to take a wait for them

02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:26.000
to fail approach.

02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:28.360
We need to catch students at risk of dyslexia

02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:30.560
before they fail and universal screening

02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:31.920
will help us do that.

02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:34.480
Universal screening K through second grade

02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:36.920
would have helped educators identify my child

02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:38.760
and count with others for being at risk

02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:41.040
for reading failure early on.

02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:43.760
It also would have helped to keep skill deficits

02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:46.640
from becoming significant achievement gaps.

02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:49.240
Universal screening helps identify those students

02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:51.800
who are at risk for reading failure.

02:11:51.800 --> 02:11:54.960
Universal screening is not the same as an assessment

02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:57.160
for special education eligibility.

02:11:57.160 --> 02:11:59.200
No child should have to struggle in school

02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:01.960
and suffer the negative effects of being unable to read

02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:05.040
because we have the tool to help our students succeed.

02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:06.560
Let's use them, thank you.

02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:07.400
Thank you.

02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:13.480
Good morning, state board of education,

02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:15.400
please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:18.280
You have one minute, your time starts now.

02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:19.680
My name is Ronique Glickman

02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:21.520
and I'm an elementary school teacher

02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:24.160
and the mother of a daughter with dyslexia.

02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:26.920
Universal screening is a tool to help identify students

02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:29.000
who are at risk of reading failure

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.800
and inform instruction in the general education classroom.

02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:35.080
A formal evaluation for special education

02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:37.760
is not a prerequisite for this to occur.

02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:40.080
Universal screening would have identified my daughter

02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:43.280
early in kindergarten and informed both her teachers

02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:45.480
and myself, saving her years of struggle

02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:46.960
and emotional distress,

02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:49.760
but instead I had to argue and fight with my peers

02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:51.560
while everyone followed the status quo

02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:53.760
of our current weight and see model.

02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:55.280
My daughter continued to fall further

02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:57.040
and further behind her peers.

02:12:57.040 --> 02:12:58.840
I feel embarrassed and ashamed

02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:00.960
that I failed to identify my own daughter

02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:02.720
along with many other of my students,

02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:05.000
including EL students.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.040
A universal screening will give teachers a tool

02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:09.280
they need to target kids at risk,

02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:12.280
ultimately saving children or family years of struggle

02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:15.280
and altering the trajectory of their lives.

02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:18.200
Finally, universal screening will prevent many students

02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:19.840
from needing special education.

02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:20.680
Ultimately-

02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:21.880
Caller, your time is up.

02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:26.720
Good morning, State Board of Education.

02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:28.800
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:30.960
You have one minute, your time starts now.

02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:37.800
Good morning, caller.

02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:40.560
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:48.560
Good morning, State Board of Education.

02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:50.800
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:53.680
You have one minute, your time starts now.

02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:55.720
Good morning, my name is Dr. Barbara Flores,

02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:57.400
CABA President-Elect.

02:13:57.400 --> 02:13:59.120
I have three concerns related

02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:02.120
to the State Literacy Plan universal screening

02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:03.000
for dyslexia.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.920
Number one, assessing pupils in K-1

02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:08.880
may not be developmentally appropriate.

02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:11.960
Two, assessment for K-1 must be validated

02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:14.080
and found statistically appropriate

02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:18.000
that is reliable for use with pupils at this age.

02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:20.920
If not, there may be a false positive

02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:24.960
and false negative leading to inappropriate placement.

02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:29.240
EL students' developmental linguistic behaviors in L2,

02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:33.680
three, EL students' developmental linguistic behavior

02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:35.440
in L2 may be similar to those

02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:38.080
of dyslexic students at K-1.

02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:41.160
If so, this will confound the results of the assessments

02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:43.720
and lead to mislabeling and misidentification

02:14:43.720 --> 02:14:45.040
of EL students.

02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:45.880
Thank you.

02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:47.720
Thank you.

02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:52.600
Good morning, State Board of Education.

02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:54.640
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:56.880
You have one minute, your time starts now.

02:14:57.920 --> 02:14:59.640
Hello, I am Dr. Lucy Edwards

02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:01.680
from Napa County Office of Education,

02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:03.720
representing CSESA and the Curriculum

02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:06.760
and Instruction Steering Committee, also known as CISC.

02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:08.880
CISC submitted a detailed letter of feedback

02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:11.520
and provided public comment to the State Board of Education

02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:14.720
regarding the State Literacy Plan in January.

02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:16.960
CISC wants to again acknowledge the efforts

02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:19.440
by the various state agencies and literacy experts

02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:22.480
that went into the development of the State Literacy Plan.

02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:24.840
We'd also like to thank the State Board of Education

02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:26.880
and the California Department of Education

02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:29.080
for taking our previous comments and feedback

02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:31.720
into consideration with the updated draft.

02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:33.520
We appreciate that the State Literacy Plan

02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:35.800
will leverage culturally sustaining pedagogies

02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:38.360
across grade bands, including specifically addressing

02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:40.560
the needs of African-American students.

02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:42.560
As this student group has been called out in the data

02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:44.520
as one of the lowest performing groups

02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:47.280
over time on the CAST summative assessments.

02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:49.440
Again, thank you for taking CISC's feedback

02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:52.360
into consideration as guidance is urgently needed

02:15:52.360 --> 02:15:54.480
to best support all students in literacy.

02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:55.320
Thank you.

02:15:55.320 --> 02:15:56.140
Thank you.

02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:00.400
Good morning.

02:16:00.400 --> 02:16:02.320
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:04.640
You have one minute and your time starts now.

02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:06.920
My name is Lorraine Richards

02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:10.880
and I am representing California Teachers Association.

02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:14.720
CTA appreciates the CDE's efforts to put together

02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:16.760
a comprehensive state literacy plan

02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:18.760
that lists and organizes resources

02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:20.440
for the state of California.

02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:24.000
The plan does an excellent job with organizing content.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:27.280
We also appreciate the clarification regarding the section

02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:30.000
regarding screening tests for dyslexia.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.600
While there is nothing wrong with screening in general,

02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:35.040
the state needs to help districts be purposeful

02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:36.920
and thoughtful in conducting the screening

02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:41.160
and differentiating between screening and diagnosis.

02:16:41.160 --> 02:16:43.640
CTA recommends that instead of universal screening

02:16:43.640 --> 02:16:45.880
beginning in the spring of kindergarten,

02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:49.240
we recommend an initial assessment at the end of grade one

02:16:49.240 --> 02:16:51.040
or at the beginning of grade two.

02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:51.960
Thank you.

02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:52.800
Thank you.

02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:56.560
Good morning.

02:16:56.560 --> 02:16:58.360
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:00.520
You have one minute, your time starts now.

02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:08.520
Good morning.

02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:10.400
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:11.400
Your time starts now.

02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:14.360
Good morning.

02:17:14.360 --> 02:17:15.640
My name is Karina Sapien.

02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:17.240
I work for SEAL and I'm here to speak

02:17:17.240 --> 02:17:19.680
on behalf of Californians Together.

02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:22.320
I have been a public school educator for over 30 years,

02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:25.280
including seven years as an elementary principal.

02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:27.240
We are asking that you consider eliminating

02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:29.320
the recommendation that all students be screened

02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:30.680
for dyslexia.

02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:32.560
As a former elementary school principal,

02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:34.880
I know that school districts and classroom teachers

02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:37.240
have built-in assessments to regularly monitor

02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:39.720
students' reading progress throughout the year.

02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:41.840
This gives them useful and valid information

02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:44.600
about who should be targeted for additional screening.

02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:47.840
Therefore, it is not only unnecessary to screen all students,

02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:50.320
it's a misuse of instructional time.

02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:52.440
As we return from a year of distance learning,

02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:54.000
all of our students will need every minute

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:55.960
they can get of teaching and learning.

02:17:55.960 --> 02:17:58.840
It makes no sense to screen those students who read well,

02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:00.520
meet grade-level reading standards,

02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:02.040
and or meet local benchmarks

02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:04.320
or other formative reading assessments.

02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:06.320
Valuable instructional time will be lost

02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:07.640
on screening every student,

02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:09.480
and the very students we are targeting

02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:11.080
have the most to lose.

02:18:11.080 --> 02:18:13.120
The screening tool should be used judiciously

02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:15.240
for those students who demonstrate that they need it

02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:16.080
and actually stand.

02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:17.320
Thank you, Paula, your time is up.

02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:18.160
Thank you.

02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:21.920
Good morning, please state your name

02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:23.400
and affiliation for the record.

02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:26.200
You have one minute, your time starts now.

02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:28.360
Good morning, my name is Dr. Anya Hurwitz,

02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:29.800
Executive Director of SEAL,

02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:31.960
Sabado Early Academic Language.

02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:33.760
I share concerns with many colleagues

02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:35.560
that a universal dyslexia screener

02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:38.440
might have some major unintended consequences,

02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:40.880
and I urge you to take into consideration

02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:44.000
the essential need that this screener be valid, reliable,

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.400
and appropriate for young English learners.

02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:49.480
I'm particularly concerned about screener administration,

02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:51.360
and I'm elevating the critical importance

02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:54.440
that the people administering these dyslexia screeners

02:18:54.440 --> 02:18:56.840
would need to receive comprehensive training

02:18:56.840 --> 02:18:59.120
to ensure deep knowledge and understanding,

02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:02.480
especially with regards to linguistically diverse students.

02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:05.000
If classroom teachers at the designated grade levels

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.440
would do the bulk of the screening,

02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:09.400
it would be essential for a comprehensive,

02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:12.800
well-defined, and fully funded plan to be created

02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:15.360
to ensure appropriate training for those teachers.

02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:16.720
So it is critical that we ensure

02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:19.120
that this screener be developed to be truly valid,

02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:21.480
reliable, and appropriate for English learners,

02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:24.280
and that there is truly adequate professional development

02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:26.440
for educators who would be responsible

02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:27.880
for administering the screeners.

02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:29.720
Thank you for your attention.

02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:30.560
Thank you, Paula.

02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:34.520
Good morning.

02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:36.560
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:38.880
You have one minute, and your time starts now.

02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:42.040
Good morning, I'm Carla Herrera.

02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:44.680
Soon to be Carla Santa Cruz this Saturday.

02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:48.160
My apologies for my earlier preemptive timing confusion

02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:50.440
must be wedding jitters.

02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:54.560
As a bi-literacy educator and former ITC member,

02:19:54.560 --> 02:19:57.000
I appreciate you have heard and heeded suggestions

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.520
to support children's language literacy

02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:01.480
and bi-literacy development.

02:20:01.480 --> 02:20:05.640
I also really like the electronic format of resources.

02:20:05.640 --> 02:20:07.720
However, I'm still concerned about the notion

02:20:07.720 --> 02:20:11.080
of a universal dyslexia screening for all children.

02:20:11.080 --> 02:20:14.080
Do you really recommend assessing children for dyslexia

02:20:14.080 --> 02:20:16.160
if they are already reading?

02:20:16.160 --> 02:20:17.960
I ask that you only screen children

02:20:17.960 --> 02:20:20.320
who may need it with these conditions.

02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:22.440
Move the timing for dyslexia screening

02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:24.120
to the spring of first grade

02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:26.240
to allow for sufficient instruction time

02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:28.520
to be able to identify those students

02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:30.800
who are indeed struggling with reading,

02:20:30.800 --> 02:20:33.600
and screen in the language of instruction,

02:20:33.600 --> 02:20:35.720
taking into account the child's emerging

02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:38.200
home language development and proficiency.

02:20:38.200 --> 02:20:39.120
Thank you so much.

02:20:39.120 --> 02:20:41.760
Thank you, Carla, and congratulations.

02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:42.600
Thank you.

02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:47.880
Good morning, State Board of Education.

02:20:47.880 --> 02:20:50.040
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:20:50.040 --> 02:20:53.040
You have one minute, your time starts now.

02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:55.600
Hello, my name is Sandy Mendoza of Families and Schools

02:20:55.600 --> 02:20:57.960
on behalf of Californians Together.

02:20:57.960 --> 02:21:00.760
Parents want to share the child's educational journey,

02:21:00.760 --> 02:21:01.960
which means that they need to know

02:21:01.960 --> 02:21:03.400
what the screening tool is about

02:21:03.400 --> 02:21:04.680
so that they can feel confident

02:21:04.680 --> 02:21:06.840
that their child is being correctly assessed

02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:09.800
and appropriate interventions and accommodations are offered.

02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:11.920
In particular, parents of English learners

02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:13.600
will want to understand what the exact nature

02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:15.480
of the factors and criteria

02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:18.360
is involved in the dyslexia screening process.

02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:21.280
Every child is unique because of a multitude of factors

02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:23.440
in and outside of school that will influence

02:21:23.440 --> 02:21:25.760
that child's educational path and progress.

02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:28.320
Toward that end, I ask that key considerations be given

02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:30.640
so that the screening correctly distinguishes

02:21:30.640 --> 02:21:33.040
between a language need and a disability.

02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:36.600
Factors such as how much exposure the child has to English

02:21:36.600 --> 02:21:38.760
and what percentage of time the native language

02:21:38.760 --> 02:21:40.280
and English spoken in the home

02:21:40.280 --> 02:21:42.040
could result in a false positive.

02:21:42.040 --> 02:21:44.280
Thus, another consideration is to conduct a screening

02:21:44.280 --> 02:21:47.280
in two languages, English and the child's native language.

02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:48.760
Thank you very much for your time.

02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:49.600
Thank you.

02:21:52.680 --> 02:21:53.960
Good morning, please state your name

02:21:53.960 --> 02:21:55.280
and affiliation for the record.

02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:56.120
You have one minute.

02:21:56.120 --> 02:21:57.120
Your time starts now.

02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:06.400
Good morning, please state your name

02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:07.680
and affiliation for the record.

02:22:07.680 --> 02:22:08.800
Your time starts now.

02:22:17.400 --> 02:22:18.960
State Board of Education,

02:22:18.960 --> 02:22:21.440
please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:22.600
Your time starts now.

02:22:23.720 --> 02:22:24.560
Hi, good morning.

02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:27.600
My name is Manuel Bonrostro with Californians Together.

02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:30.720
And I just wanna say that it is appreciated

02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:32.200
that details were added regarding

02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:34.920
the Local Literacy Lead Agencies Grant,

02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:36.920
specifically clarifying that each grantee,

02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:39.560
regardless of statewide priority focus,

02:22:39.560 --> 02:22:41.960
would be required to implement programs

02:22:41.960 --> 02:22:45.240
aligned to the comprehensive and integrated literacy model,

02:22:45.240 --> 02:22:47.080
including integration of all key themes

02:22:47.080 --> 02:22:49.040
of the English language arts,

02:22:49.040 --> 02:22:51.080
English language development framework,

02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:54.160
all strands of the California Common Core Standards

02:22:54.160 --> 02:22:56.120
for English language arts,

02:22:56.120 --> 02:22:58.800
and culturally relevant and sustaining pedagogies.

02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:01.120
We also appreciate the language

02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:04.320
about leveraging evidence-based family literacy strategies

02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:07.560
to ensure that our families are engaged throughout,

02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:09.600
and also making sure that there's a focus

02:23:09.600 --> 02:23:11.640
on the needs of underserved students,

02:23:11.640 --> 02:23:13.640
including children living in poverty,

02:23:13.640 --> 02:23:16.160
English learners, children with disabilities,

02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:17.720
and children of color.

02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:20.960
Thanks again for making these changes to the grant,

02:23:20.960 --> 02:23:23.840
and thank you for listening to our comments.

02:23:23.840 --> 02:23:24.680
Thank you.

02:23:28.680 --> 02:23:29.520
Good morning.

02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:31.160
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:23:31.160 --> 02:23:32.000
You have one minute.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:33.000
Your time starts now.

02:23:34.200 --> 02:23:35.720
My name is Maureen Graves.

02:23:35.720 --> 02:23:37.600
I'm co-chair of the California Association

02:23:37.600 --> 02:23:39.480
for Parent-Child Advocacy.

02:23:39.480 --> 02:23:40.560
I've been representing parents

02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:43.560
seeking special ed services since 1994,

02:23:43.560 --> 02:23:45.200
mostly Spanish-speaking clients,

02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:47.120
about half of whom have autism.

02:23:47.120 --> 02:23:49.240
All my clients have literacy needs.

02:23:49.240 --> 02:23:50.760
My own adult son's with autism,

02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:52.600
one of whom also has intellectual disability,

02:23:52.600 --> 02:23:54.320
learned to talk at ages two and three

02:23:54.320 --> 02:23:56.400
with applied behavior analysis.

02:23:56.400 --> 02:23:59.440
For them, as for many children, language was hard won,

02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:02.280
not natural, as the state literacy plan claimed.

02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:05.000
My sons left into decoding in a week when they were four,

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.560
when their teachers showed them the code for reading English

02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:08.800
and have made it through the pandemic,

02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:11.360
largely by reading fiction and nonfiction,

02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:12.920
as their jobs are on hold.

02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:16.160
Many of my clients were never taught to read.

02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:17.760
Over the years, statewide documents

02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:19.560
have helped me advocate for children.

02:24:19.560 --> 02:24:21.960
This document departs from that proud tradition,

02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:25.960
as explained in my written submissions in November and March.

02:24:25.960 --> 02:24:26.960
Thank you.

02:24:26.960 --> 02:24:27.800
Thank you.

02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:33.240
Good morning.

02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:35.000
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:35.840
You have one minute.

02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:37.400
Your time starts now.

02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:38.240
Good morning.

02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:39.600
Martha Zaragoza Diaz,

02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:41.960
representing the California Association

02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:44.880
for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:47.600
We believe the universal screening for dyslexia

02:24:47.600 --> 02:24:51.120
requires further strengthening specific to English learners.

02:24:51.120 --> 02:24:53.480
As reflected in our letter of March 8th,

02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:56.560
our recommendations include moving the timing

02:24:56.560 --> 02:24:59.080
for dyslexia screening to the end of first grade

02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:01.520
to allow for sufficient literacy instruction

02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:05.600
to be able to identify those students struggling with reading

02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:09.280
and eliminating the requirement that all students be assessed.

02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:11.200
Not all students need to be screened.

02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:14.960
Those students who read well meet grade level reading standards

02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:16.840
and or meet local benchmark

02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:19.120
or other formative reading assessments

02:25:19.160 --> 02:25:21.160
do not need to be assessed.

02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:25.040
Please revise the state plan to reflect these recommendations

02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:26.720
and the others in our letter.

02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:27.560
Thank you.

02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:28.400
Thank you.

02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:33.800
Good morning.

02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:35.480
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:25:35.480 --> 02:25:36.320
You have one minute.

02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:37.200
Your time starts now.

02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:39.400
Good morning.

02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:42.280
I apologize for speaking on the wrong action item previously,

02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:44.200
but my name is Crystal Diaz

02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:46.480
and I am with Californians Together.

02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:48.920
As an organization representing English learners,

02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:51.240
we want to ensure that students receive the support

02:25:51.240 --> 02:25:53.800
that they need and are appropriately identified

02:25:53.800 --> 02:25:55.360
for those supports.

02:25:55.360 --> 02:25:57.040
It is for this reason that we encourage

02:25:57.040 --> 02:25:58.480
the State Board of Education

02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:03.480
to encourage stronger monitoring by local educational agencies

02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:07.040
on the proportionality of ELs and other subgroups

02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:09.720
identified as dyslexic to their percentage

02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:11.840
of the total student population.

02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:14.800
This information can help LEAs reflect on the efficiency

02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:18.160
of their identification and intervention strategies.

02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:19.360
Thank you.

02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:20.200
Thank you.

02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:26.240
Good morning.

02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:27.920
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:28.760
You have one minute.

Your time starts now.

02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:35.640
Good morning.

02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:36.720
Caller, are you there?

02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:44.120
Good morning.

02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:46.160
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:47.000

Your time starts now.

02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:00.840
Good morning, caller.

02:27:00.840 --> 02:27:03.400
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:04.240

02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:05.440
Your time starts now.

02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:15.720
Good morning, caller.

Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:19.120

02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:28.440
Hello?

02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:29.640
Hello.

02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:30.480
Please speak.

02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:31.600
Hi, my name's Michael Miller.

02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:33.960
My daughter Layla attends Ross Valley Charter School

02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:35.160
in Fairfax.

02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:37.200
Oh, I'm sorry, sir?

02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:38.480
Could you please call back?

02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:40.160
We are currently taking public comment

02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:41.280
for item number four.

02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:43.800
Your item is coming up later on today.

02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:44.640
Thank you.

02:27:45.720 --> 02:27:46.560
Thank you.

02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:51.280
Good morning.

02:27:51.280 --> 02:27:53.520
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:54.360
You have one minute.

02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:55.480
Your time starts now.

02:27:56.480 --> 02:27:57.320
Good morning.

02:27:57.320 --> 02:27:58.480
My name is Elvia Armas,

02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:00.160
Director and Affiliated Faculty

02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:03.080
at LNU Center for Equity for English Learners.

02:28:03.080 --> 02:28:04.560
We share concerns regarding

02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:06.640
the universal dyslexia screening

02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:09.240
and the valid, reliable, and appropriate use

02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:10.880
for young English learners.

02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:12.000
We've noted the reference

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.120
to the California Practitioner's Guide

02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:16.760
and dyslexia guidelines in the SLP,

02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:20.560
yet urge the addition of the following to this document.

02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:23.320
One, specific expectations for screening

02:28:23.320 --> 02:28:25.120
and assessment processes,

02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:27.720
including language development factors,

02:28:27.720 --> 02:28:31.000
such as oral language skills, language proficiency,

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:34.120
context of use, and instructional strategy.

02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:36.520
Two, monitoring guidelines to ensure

02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:37.880
that black and brown children,

02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:39.280
as well as English learners

02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:41.440
of all ethnic and racial backgrounds,

02:28:41.440 --> 02:28:44.800
are not overly identified as dyslexic.

02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:46.800
We must look to the entire system

02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:48.480
to hold ourselves accountable.

02:28:48.480 --> 02:28:51.920
I strongly urge you to include accountability guidelines

02:28:51.920 --> 02:28:54.560
for LEAs to develop critical checkpoints

02:28:54.560 --> 02:28:57.440
that consider proportionality of the observed,

02:28:57.440 --> 02:28:59.880
assessed, and identified as dyslexic

02:28:59.880 --> 02:29:02.400
to the screening and assessment processes.

02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:03.240
Thank you.

02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:04.080
Thank you.

02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:07.800
Good morning.

02:29:07.800 --> 02:29:09.920
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:29:09.920 --> 02:29:10.760
You have one minute.

02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:11.800
Your time starts now.

02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:14.080
Yes, good morning.

02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:15.440
My name is Carolina Serna.

02:29:15.440 --> 02:29:18.160
I'm an associate professor at Biola University,

02:29:18.160 --> 02:29:19.440
and I also sit on the board

02:29:19.440 --> 02:29:23.360
of the California Association for Bilingual Education.

02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:27.320
As a professor who teaches literacy development methods

02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:31.120
for teacher candidates,

02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:34.960
I want to express my concern regarding the recommendation

02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:37.920
for universal screening for dyslexia.

02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:40.640
I recommend that only students who exhibit difficulties

02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:43.080
with emergent literacy should be screened.

02:29:43.080 --> 02:29:44.840
Those students who read well

02:29:44.840 --> 02:29:46.560
meet grade-level reading standards

02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:48.240
and or meet local benchmarks

02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:50.640
or other formative reading assessments

02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:52.320
do not need to be assessed.

02:29:52.320 --> 02:29:55.480
I also recommend that all multilingual students be assessed

02:29:55.480 --> 02:29:58.000
in their native language

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.480
as well as the language of instruction.

02:30:00.480 --> 02:30:02.760
In addition, I would like to see an expanded focus

02:30:02.760 --> 02:30:05.280
on biliteracy in general in the plan,

02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:09.080
as well as more inclusion of resources

02:30:09.080 --> 02:30:11.720
in the English learner toolkit

02:30:11.720 --> 02:30:13.640
that address biliteracy.

02:30:13.640 --> 02:30:14.480
Thank you.

02:30:14.480 --> 02:30:15.320
Thank you.

02:30:18.600 --> 02:30:19.440
Good morning.

02:30:19.440 --> 02:30:21.280
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:30:21.280 --> 02:30:22.120
You have one minute.

02:30:22.120 --> 02:30:23.200
Your time starts now.

02:30:24.800 --> 02:30:25.640
Yes.

02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:33.640
Paula, are you there?

02:30:36.320 --> 02:30:38.160
Yeah, I'm at source 12.

02:30:38.200 --> 02:30:39.360
We can barely hear you.

02:30:39.360 --> 02:30:41.840
If you could speak a little louder.

02:30:42.960 --> 02:30:44.920
We can use ratio table.

02:30:44.920 --> 02:30:45.760
Okay.

02:30:49.920 --> 02:30:50.760
Good morning.

02:30:50.760 --> 02:30:52.760
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:30:52.760 --> 02:30:53.600
You have one minute.

02:30:53.600 --> 02:30:54.640
Your time starts now.

02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:03.760
Okay.

02:31:09.120 --> 02:31:09.960
Good morning.

02:31:09.960 --> 02:31:12.160
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:31:12.160 --> 02:31:13.000
You have one minute.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:14.120
Your time starts now.

02:31:16.040 --> 02:31:18.400
My name is Deborah Schlegel on behalf of CAFCA,

02:31:18.400 --> 02:31:21.480
California Association for Parent Child Advocacy.

02:31:21.480 --> 02:31:23.200
It is ironic that earlier today,

02:31:23.200 --> 02:31:25.680
this group talked about inclusive practices,

02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:28.560
yet the SLP includes, quote unquote,

02:31:28.560 --> 02:31:30.000
natural language development

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.760
in the birth to age five literacy section.

02:31:32.760 --> 02:31:36.000
This language is offensive and misleading

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:37.120
and should be removed.

02:31:37.160 --> 02:31:38.880
Careful consideration should be given

02:31:38.880 --> 02:31:40.920
to how it excludes a substantial number

02:31:40.920 --> 02:31:42.600
of children with disabilities

02:31:42.600 --> 02:31:44.720
who need specially designed instruction

02:31:44.720 --> 02:31:46.400
like applied behavior analysis

02:31:46.400 --> 02:31:49.360
and traditional speech and language pathology services.

02:31:49.360 --> 02:31:51.680
This harmful language is not irrelevant.

02:31:53.320 --> 02:31:55.680
As the IDEA reminds us,

02:31:55.680 --> 02:31:58.200
disability is a natural part of the human experience

02:31:58.200 --> 02:32:00.720
and in no way diminishes the right of individuals

02:32:00.720 --> 02:32:04.080
to participate in or contribute to society.

02:32:04.120 --> 02:32:07.440
I urge you to have an inclusion specialist

02:32:07.440 --> 02:32:10.480
on every committee that works on projects like these.

02:32:10.480 --> 02:32:12.320
Thank you very much for your time.

02:32:12.320 --> 02:32:13.160
Thank you.

02:32:17.680 --> 02:32:18.520
Good morning.

02:32:18.520 --> 02:32:20.360
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:32:20.360 --> 02:32:21.200
You have one minute.

02:32:21.200 --> 02:32:22.080
Your time starts now.

02:32:26.960 --> 02:32:27.800
Okay.

02:32:27.800 --> 02:32:30.240
It looks like that concludes public comment

02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:31.560
for this item.

02:32:31.560 --> 02:32:32.400
Thank you.

02:32:34.920 --> 02:32:37.880
Thank you very much.

02:32:37.880 --> 02:32:41.600
I want to appreciate all of the callers

02:32:41.600 --> 02:32:45.800
for raising the range of concerns that have been raised.

02:32:45.800 --> 02:32:47.920
I do want to start off the discussion

02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:52.920
by sharing that when I saw some of the comment letters

02:32:53.240 --> 02:32:58.240
come in, I did call on several of the experts

02:32:59.040 --> 02:33:03.440
in the state who are involved in developing screeners

02:33:03.440 --> 02:33:08.440
and want to share that several things.

02:33:08.560 --> 02:33:13.560
First, as the parent of two dyslexic children,

02:33:13.600 --> 02:33:18.520
I appreciate the comments about the importance

02:33:18.520 --> 02:33:23.520
of screening early, which is not a,

02:33:23.760 --> 02:33:25.840
as was earlier made the point,

02:33:25.840 --> 02:33:28.800
which is not the same as establishing

02:33:28.800 --> 02:33:31.680
special education eligibility.

02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:34.280
I think that the language in the plan

02:33:34.280 --> 02:33:38.680
that seems to conflate those is confusing to folks

02:33:38.680 --> 02:33:41.800
and will probably need to be adjusted or removed.

02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:46.720
But the two major screening efforts in the state

02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:48.480
that are under development,

02:33:48.480 --> 02:33:51.480
one at UCSF under the guidance

02:33:51.480 --> 02:33:53.800
of the dyslexia center there,

02:33:53.800 --> 02:33:56.480
Dr. Maria Luisa Giorno Tempini,

02:33:56.480 --> 02:33:59.240
and one at UCLA under the guidance

02:33:59.240 --> 02:34:04.240
of Dr. Marianne Wolf, who's just arrived there

02:34:04.600 --> 02:34:08.920
in the last couple of years from Harvard University.

02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:12.960
Both of these are efforts that one of them

02:34:12.960 --> 02:34:16.560
with state support that are intended

02:34:16.560 --> 02:34:18.880
to be in multiple languages,

02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:23.640
are intended not to automatically lead

02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:26.400
to any kind of diagnosis or placement,

02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:28.560
but simply to provide information

02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:33.600
on which other analyses of next steps can be taken.

02:34:33.840 --> 02:34:38.600
And so I think that the concern about the point

02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:40.880
of screening and the outcomes of screening

02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:43.680
will need to be clarified in the plan

02:34:43.680 --> 02:34:46.280
so that we don't have the expectation

02:34:46.280 --> 02:34:50.280
that somehow we're screening students prematurely

02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:55.280
in a language setting that is inappropriate

02:34:55.280 --> 02:34:59.200
for somehow automatic placement in special education.

02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:02.680
That is not a goal of screeners.

02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:06.520
They also shared with me and I passed on to our staff

02:35:06.520 --> 02:35:09.520
a number of articles that have been published

02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:13.320
in the literature about the stage of screening

02:35:13.320 --> 02:35:18.320
and the kind of learning supports for readers

02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:23.200
that can be provided based on that information

02:35:23.200 --> 02:35:26.480
and other information that is gathered in further analyses.

02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:30.480
And it is clear that understanding the needs

02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:34.480
of learners sooner at the end of kindergarten

02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:36.960
rather than later makes a big difference

02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:40.800
in the opportunity for that student to be well-taught

02:35:40.800 --> 02:35:44.080
and caught up and in sync with other learners

02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:47.240
by the end of first grade and high school.

02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:52.240
So that's a big part of first grade and on into other grades.

02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:57.000
So I think we do need to, as we proceed,

02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:02.000
clarify that screeners are not disability identifiers

02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:03.560
or placement tools.

02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:08.200
They are information tools to be used

02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:12.120
to then build other analyses.

02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:17.120
And if there is a need for further diagnostics,

02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:21.240
to flag those diagnostics to then occur.

02:36:21.240 --> 02:36:26.240
So I will open up the floor for discussion at this point

02:36:27.240 --> 02:36:31.120
and glad to share anything else about those conversations

02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:34.000
if folks want to pursue that.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.520
And member Rucker, you are first in the queue.

02:36:37.560 --> 02:36:38.840
Thank you very much.

02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:42.240
I listened with great interest to the comments

02:36:42.240 --> 02:36:44.920
that came out of the public discussion

02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:48.920
and I do have two questions or concerns

02:36:48.920 --> 02:36:51.840
that I want to speak on briefly.

02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:55.040
The first one's a little bit easier than the second.

02:36:55.040 --> 02:36:57.320
This will be the second consecutive item

02:36:57.320 --> 02:36:59.160
on today's agenda.

02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:03.160
And every agenda we have had since I've been on the board

02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:06.200
has always talked about looking at closing

02:37:06.200 --> 02:37:08.440
or addressing the performance gap

02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:11.160
of underrepresented students, of students of color

02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:14.360
and figuring out where the priorities need to be

02:37:14.360 --> 02:37:18.200
in providing the critical supports for students of color

02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:21.240
and underrepresented students and English learners.

02:37:21.240 --> 02:37:26.000
At some point in time, there needs to this priority

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:30.880
that the board keeps stating needs to become apparent

02:37:30.880 --> 02:37:34.080
in the work that LEAs are doing

02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:37.200
to address this particular group.

02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:39.080
We continue to talk about the need

02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:42.200
to close the performance gap and talk about the need

02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:45.320
to make these students a priority.

02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:49.600
Yet in this plan, we continue to state

02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:52.200
that the LEAs receiving these grants

02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:54.880
will identify their own local priorities.

02:37:54.880 --> 02:37:58.800
And I'm sorry to say, oftentimes those priorities

02:37:58.800 --> 02:38:02.200
concerning students of color, concerning English learners

02:38:02.200 --> 02:38:06.280
are not always apparent and are not always as explicit

02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:08.560
as what's been written in this plan.

02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:11.480
So there does need to be some accountability

02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:16.480
to the subgrantees, not just for the outcomes of the program

02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:20.280
but to also think about how you hold them accountable

02:38:20.280 --> 02:38:23.920
in the RFA to articulate how they are going

02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:26.080
to make the students we've identified

02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:27.960
as the priority of this grant,

02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:30.640
the priority of the work that they will do

02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:33.720
in the services they provide for professional learning

02:38:33.720 --> 02:38:36.520
as well as the resources that they will be using

02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:39.720
to provide in those classrooms to support instruction.

02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:43.000
So that was the easier comment for me to make.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.320
The second one is a little bit more difficult.

02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:49.600
I rely on the expertise and the comments that I hear

02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:53.120
from the public and from a lot of the people

02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:57.600
that our board president spoke to about what is the best way

02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:00.400
to deal with the idea of universal screening

02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:03.040
and to look at the concern of dyslexia.

02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:05.920
And the continuum is very broad.

02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:09.400
There are very clear and very distinct differences

02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:13.320
of opinion, not about whether or not we should be using

02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:18.320
universal screening, but when and how and whom.

02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:23.240
And so I think that I agree with the recommendation

02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:26.080
that's been made to look at when the screening is done.

02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:30.520
And I even agree that maybe starting in kindergarten

02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:34.000
might be too early because when I did teach kindergarten

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:37.720
for one year, I referred all of them to speech therapy

02:39:37.720 --> 02:39:39.640
and the speech therapist had to come and tell me

02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:41.560
they're supposed to sound like that.

02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:44.560
So I understand that there are issues

02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:46.040
with doing universal screening.

02:39:46.040 --> 02:39:50.120
And I think I agree with the idea of waiting

02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:53.360
until the children are in first grade.

02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:56.920
But I think that we're vesting too much

02:39:56.920 --> 02:39:58.880
on what universal screening can do.

02:39:58.880 --> 02:40:02.280
And that's the point our board president just made.

02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:06.040
Assessment, particularly as it relates to literacy,

02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:08.360
can have multiple purposes.

02:40:08.360 --> 02:40:13.280
And with the system that this plan proposes to implement,

02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:17.640
we're implementing a system of assessment and monitoring

02:40:17.640 --> 02:40:22.240
that's identified and explained in the multiple resources

02:40:22.240 --> 02:40:23.560
that have been identified,

02:40:23.560 --> 02:40:27.840
including our guidance on language development.

02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:31.280
Maybe a good way to make this plainer

02:40:31.280 --> 02:40:34.280
would be to talk about the purposes of the reasons

02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:37.600
why those references or resources were included.

02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:40.640
So clearly we do need to explain and clarify

02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:44.480
the state's intention and policy on universal screening.

02:40:44.480 --> 02:40:46.720
I agree with the amendment that was made,

02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:48.880
but I do think we should clarify

02:40:48.880 --> 02:40:51.400
that universal screening is something separate

02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:53.520
from the purpose of diagnosing a need

02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:55.480
for placement in special ed.

02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:57.480
But there are other types of assessments,

02:40:57.480 --> 02:40:59.080
intervention planning,

02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:01.960
to make database decisions for instruction.

02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:03.320
We have guidance about that,

02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:04.680
both in the framework

02:41:04.680 --> 02:41:07.160
and in the language development guidance.

02:41:07.160 --> 02:41:08.680
Progress monitoring.

02:41:08.680 --> 02:41:12.520
That's the purposes of our formative assessment practices

02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:14.120
and the other tools that we use,

02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:16.480
particularly with English learners.

02:41:16.480 --> 02:41:18.520
And diagnostic evaluation,

02:41:18.520 --> 02:41:22.200
to identify a student's learning strengths and weaknesses.

02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:24.160
These are the things for the people

02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:26.960
who are truly urgently advocating

02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:29.200
for this universal screening tool.

02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:32.800
That's really more what they are urging the use of the tool

02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:36.960
and that's actually not the appropriate use of a screener.

02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:40.200
So maybe there just needs to be some time taken

02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:43.920
to differentiate the types of assessment activities

02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:45.760
that this literacy plan,

02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:49.200
although I understand where each of these elements are,

02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:50.680
that where this literacy plan

02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:53.040
incorporates all of these elements,

02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:55.600
so that we have a system of assessment

02:41:55.600 --> 02:41:57.600
and not just a single tool

02:41:57.600 --> 02:42:00.160
or a single type of assessment activity

02:42:00.200 --> 02:42:03.080
that becomes the central focus of our concerns

02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:04.800
about the work of this plan.

02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:05.640
Thank you.

02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:08.280
Thank you.

02:42:08.280 --> 02:42:10.160
I'm looking to see if there are others

02:42:10.160 --> 02:42:11.840
who would like to add on.

02:42:11.840 --> 02:42:16.840
I'm not seeing any other hands raised yet,

02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:20.320
but we will give you some wait time.

02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:21.160
Thank you.

02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:31.840
Member Petia Bronson and then member Rodriguez.

02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:36.400
So I wanna lift up a couple of points,

02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:38.320
some of which I think have been addressed

02:42:38.320 --> 02:42:40.840
in public comment and the presentation

02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:44.760
and then to name a couple that haven't really been so much

02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:47.280
the topic of our conversation thus far.

02:42:48.160 --> 02:42:53.160
I think the clarification that board president offered

02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:56.200
around the purpose of the screeners,

02:42:56.200 --> 02:42:57.560
what they are and what they are not

02:42:57.560 --> 02:43:00.800
in terms of placement and special ed designations

02:43:00.800 --> 02:43:03.720
I think could be helpful in a way

02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:06.000
that might also allay some of the concerns

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.320
I think that have been raised

02:43:08.320 --> 02:43:12.440
and also wanting to reflect that having this

02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:16.560
at the beginning of kindergarten does have some challenges

02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:19.800
and especially needs to address the fact

02:43:19.800 --> 02:43:21.720
that kids are coming in with different levels

02:43:21.720 --> 02:43:26.720
of literacy exposure to books,

02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:31.960
to print generally and the potential

02:43:32.600 --> 02:43:35.480
for both false positives,

02:43:35.480 --> 02:43:38.720
but also just the potential to really,

02:43:38.720 --> 02:43:43.200
to help think about what types of teacher training

02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:46.840
and might be needed in different contexts

02:43:46.840 --> 02:43:49.120
depending on what the demographics

02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:51.880
of a particular district or school might be.

02:43:54.200 --> 02:43:57.760
One of the questions that I have been thinking about

02:43:57.760 --> 02:43:59.280
through the presentation and particularly,

02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:01.040
I guess this goes more to Barbara.

02:44:02.160 --> 02:44:07.160
This is a compendium of what exists already, right?

02:44:08.160 --> 02:44:13.160
So I just wanna clarify that the existing literacy plan

02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:20.080
does not require any usage of a screener.

02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:24.880
It doesn't incentivize, it doesn't penalize

02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:27.080
if a screener is not used.

02:44:27.080 --> 02:44:29.920
This is actually bringing together what already exists

02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:33.840
rather than prescribing what should be

02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:35.280
in the future, is that correct?

02:44:35.280 --> 02:44:38.080
That is absolutely correct.

02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:40.720
I think the language that has caused

02:44:40.720 --> 02:44:42.280
so much consternation today

02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:46.120
is right out of California's Dyslexia Guidelines,

02:44:49.560 --> 02:44:53.720
which is a guidance document that we have shared

02:44:53.720 --> 02:44:56.280
with educators across California,

02:44:56.280 --> 02:44:59.960
but certainly not a document that can't be updated.

02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:05.800
Right, so we have been pretty consistent

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:09.520
in not creating any new guidance.

02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:14.240
As I mentioned, we develop frameworks and policy,

02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:18.080
you all do that over the course of many years

02:45:18.080 --> 02:45:20.440
in a prescribed fashion.

02:45:20.440 --> 02:45:24.480
So one of our kind of guiding principles is like,

02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:26.200
we're not creating any new guidance.

02:45:26.200 --> 02:45:30.320
We're gonna try and pull together the guidance that exists

02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:33.640
and there is a lot of it in a way to make it coherent

02:45:33.640 --> 02:45:34.840
and useful for folks.

02:45:34.840 --> 02:45:39.360
So that's where the language came from,

02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:44.240
but again, we can update that moving forward.

02:45:44.240 --> 02:45:46.720
We're excited to have so many different dyslexia

02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:49.120
focused efforts happening in the state right now,

02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:52.200
the California Dyslexia Initiative getting up and going,

02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:55.440
lots of good work happening.

02:45:55.480 --> 02:45:58.800
It might be worth just bringing the Dyslexia Guidelines

02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:02.560
to some of our experts in this area right now to review

02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:06.840
and really have a robust conversation around screening

02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:09.360
because the guidelines are now a few years old.

02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:11.560
Yeah, I think that's a really,

02:46:11.560 --> 02:46:13.360
I'm sorry, go ahead, Member Patu.

02:46:13.360 --> 02:46:14.480
I just wanted to confirm,

02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:16.920
so nothing in the adoption of the state plan

02:46:16.920 --> 02:46:20.040
will preclude us from having that conversation

02:46:20.040 --> 02:46:21.880
under different auspices?

02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:23.960
No, absolutely not.

02:46:23.960 --> 02:46:28.760
And no one is required to implement any of the guidance

02:46:28.760 --> 02:46:30.120
in this state plan.

02:46:30.120 --> 02:46:34.720
This is just our best thinking based on what the state

02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:39.000
has developed over the years to support literacy instruction.

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.160
Great, thank you.

02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:42.880
Sorry, Linda, did you wanna comment?

02:46:42.880 --> 02:46:44.240
Yeah, I was just going to respond

02:46:44.240 --> 02:46:46.640
and then I, Member Rodriguez,

02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:49.120
I'll come straight to you in a moment.

02:46:49.960 --> 02:46:54.960
So, I'm thinking about the fact that I've heard a number

02:46:55.360 --> 02:46:58.520
of experts in the field say that our Dyslexia Guidelines

02:46:58.520 --> 02:47:00.720
also could use updating.

02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:03.960
So I think that the point that Barbara is making

02:47:03.960 --> 02:47:06.320
on that score is potentially something

02:47:06.320 --> 02:47:08.680
that needs to be thought about.

02:47:08.680 --> 02:47:11.160
I'm not sure that for the purpose that we do need

02:47:11.160 --> 02:47:14.440
to approve a literacy plan today to stay current

02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:17.160
with the federal process that we are engaged in

02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:19.960
and allocation of funds to the field.

02:47:19.960 --> 02:47:23.720
I don't think that this question about screening needs

02:47:23.720 --> 02:47:27.960
to be in the literacy plan for us to be able to move ahead

02:47:27.960 --> 02:47:29.720
with the literacy plan.

02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:31.880
And I do think a lot of the points have been made.

02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:35.080
I mean, the point about who will be the screeners,

02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:36.800
what's the expertise that's needed,

02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:39.000
which screeners are we talking about?

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:43.440
Because there are a variety of potential screeners out there,

02:47:43.440 --> 02:47:45.880
some of which may be multilingual, some may not,

02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:48.320
some of which may be really focused more

02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:50.080
on both literacy skills.

02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:51.640
Most screeners, by the way, are not trying

02:47:51.640 --> 02:47:53.760
to measure your literacy skills.

02:47:53.760 --> 02:47:55.760
They're trying to measure sort of pre-literacy

02:47:55.760 --> 02:48:00.240
and also other ways of processing sound

02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:02.760
and text-based information.

02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:06.400
But I think we really need to get clarity on that

02:48:06.400 --> 02:48:09.760
and we need to understand what we're recommending

02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:11.640
when we do recommend something

02:48:11.640 --> 02:48:13.680
and maybe the best course of action

02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:16.360
for us on the literacy plan today

02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:20.960
is to eliminate those paragraphs that have caused confusion.

02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:24.160
Even if they do derive from our literacy,

02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:26.480
from our dyslexia guidelines

02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:29.160
and revisit that whole question,

02:48:29.160 --> 02:48:31.360
which deserves our attention,

02:48:31.360 --> 02:48:33.280
deserves the attention of the field,

02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:35.600
can supplement the guidance

02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:38.000
that comes from the literacy plan

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:41.720
to allow people to move forward in a much more coherent way

02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:44.080
with a common and shared understanding

02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:48.240
of what we might be recommending when, how,

02:48:48.240 --> 02:48:50.760
why, and toward what end.

02:48:50.760 --> 02:48:53.480
So that would be, I think, my recommendation

02:48:53.480 --> 02:48:55.880
on that piece of it.

02:48:55.880 --> 02:48:57.640
Member Rodriguez.

02:48:57.640 --> 02:48:58.760
Thank you.

02:48:58.760 --> 02:49:00.000
Actually, Linda, can I?

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:01.200
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:49:01.200 --> 02:49:02.800
There was just one more point I just wanted to-

02:49:02.800 --> 02:49:03.640
Oh, I'm so sorry.

02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:04.480
I thought you were done.

02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:05.320
I apologize.

02:49:07.320 --> 02:49:08.920
As I was reading the literacy plan,

02:49:08.920 --> 02:49:10.640
I also was just really struck

02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:15.640
by the degree to which we have really good disaggregated data

02:49:15.680 --> 02:49:17.960
at this point to say in pinpoint

02:49:17.960 --> 02:49:20.440
where some of our racial gaps are.

02:49:20.440 --> 02:49:24.720
And what was also equally striking was to realize

02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:29.680
that although the diagnostic work is quite strong,

02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:34.080
the set of solutions that should accompany good diagnostics

02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:36.880
were a little bit light as we were, I think,

02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:40.520
and this is not at all a critique of the plan itself,

02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:44.680
but it is drawing on what exists in the way of solution sets

02:49:44.680 --> 02:49:48.360
to address racial disparities,

02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:50.320
particularly for African-American children,

02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:51.720
for Latino children.

02:49:53.240 --> 02:49:55.440
And I think even though it doesn't,

02:49:55.440 --> 02:49:57.240
it's not required for us to actually put this

02:49:57.240 --> 02:50:00.960
in the state plan, but it does shine a light

02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:03.520
on some gaps that we have of work ahead

02:50:03.520 --> 02:50:05.680
that needs to, I think, be further fleshed out.

02:50:05.680 --> 02:50:09.320
And so I really appreciated Board Member Rucker's comments

02:50:09.320 --> 02:50:13.600
around how do we actually use the RFA

02:50:13.600 --> 02:50:18.320
as a opportunity to build some of that in,

02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:23.320
to actually structurally incentivize districts

02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:27.280
or county offices of ed that receive these funds

02:50:27.280 --> 02:50:29.760
to actually take this focus on

02:50:29.760 --> 02:50:31.600
and create some of the innovation

02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:34.080
that we're wanting to see that doesn't exist

02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:38.200
because it's not in the state plan currently,

02:50:38.240 --> 02:50:41.640
but could if we lift up local innovation.

02:50:41.640 --> 02:50:43.160
That's a great point.

02:50:43.160 --> 02:50:44.000
Thank you.

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:44.840
And the last thing I just want to say

02:50:44.840 --> 02:50:47.760
is I love the early literacy, the inclusion of zero to five.

02:50:47.760 --> 02:50:50.080
It is a step in the right direction

02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:53.920
that it's both values talk as well as a 15% set aside

02:50:53.920 --> 02:50:56.800
on the funding, so that's it, thanks.

02:50:56.800 --> 02:50:58.120
Terrific, thank you.

02:50:59.160 --> 02:51:00.640
And Member Rodriguez.

02:51:00.640 --> 02:51:01.680
Yes, thank you.

02:51:01.680 --> 02:51:06.120
So I'd like to really acknowledge all of Barbara's work

02:51:06.120 --> 02:51:09.280
and the committee that put all of this together.

02:51:10.400 --> 02:51:14.640
And I want to echo Member Rucker's

02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:17.080
and then Member Patio's comments.

02:51:17.080 --> 02:51:20.360
And thank you so much, President Darlene Hammond

02:51:20.360 --> 02:51:23.040
for that clarification on the dyslexia

02:51:23.040 --> 02:51:26.000
because that really helped a lot.

02:51:27.160 --> 02:51:32.080
And I also want to say that the portal

02:51:32.080 --> 02:51:34.760
for California educators together

02:51:34.760 --> 02:51:39.200
is an incredible resource for teachers, for professionals.

02:51:39.200 --> 02:51:42.280
And there's, excuse me, there's a lot in here,

02:51:43.680 --> 02:51:45.120
but I did notice something missing

02:51:45.120 --> 02:51:49.000
and that's national board professional standards

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:52.920
for reading literacy, language arts,

02:51:52.920 --> 02:51:57.920
which I think would be a great resource to include in here

02:51:58.360 --> 02:52:01.000
because it's very rich and it kind of follows

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:01.920
what we're doing.

02:52:01.920 --> 02:52:05.840
And teachers can use this to improve

02:52:05.840 --> 02:52:08.560
our own literacy and classes, so thank you.

02:52:12.680 --> 02:52:17.680
I want to just before, I don't see any other hands raised,

02:52:18.120 --> 02:52:22.320
but before we get to developing a motion,

02:52:22.320 --> 02:52:25.440
I want to see if Barbara wants to kind of respond

02:52:25.440 --> 02:52:30.440
to any of the commentary or questions that have come up.

02:52:32.920 --> 02:52:35.200
I think I mostly just want to thank all of you.

02:52:35.200 --> 02:52:38.280
And in particular, Member Patio Bronson,

02:52:38.280 --> 02:52:43.280
just you're noticing like what we notice is not in the plan

02:52:43.840 --> 02:52:46.800
or might not be quite right in the plan,

02:52:46.800 --> 02:52:50.720
points us in the direction of additional work

02:52:50.720 --> 02:52:52.680
that's ahead for us as we move down

02:52:52.680 --> 02:52:54.160
with implementing this grant.

02:52:55.840 --> 02:52:59.920
To be completely frank, I'm pretty thrilled

02:53:00.280 --> 02:53:05.280
that our concerns narrowed down to universal screening.

02:53:05.640 --> 02:53:07.840
There is a lot in this plan.

02:53:07.840 --> 02:53:12.080
So I'm happy that the universal screening piece,

02:53:12.080 --> 02:53:14.960
the how are we supporting specific groups of students

02:53:14.960 --> 02:53:19.520
to be more successful, those are things that are reflected

02:53:19.520 --> 02:53:21.800
in the statewide literacy priorities

02:53:21.800 --> 02:53:23.960
that we want to sub-grant people to work on.

02:53:23.960 --> 02:53:27.320
So I just want to thank you all

02:53:27.320 --> 02:53:29.520
for all of the great input and discussion

02:53:30.240 --> 02:53:34.280
that you've given both today and in January.

02:53:34.280 --> 02:53:37.800
And I'm excited to get on with getting some of these funds

02:53:37.800 --> 02:53:40.280
out and improving some literacy outcomes.

02:53:42.200 --> 02:53:43.040
Sounds good.

02:53:43.040 --> 02:53:47.000
Are there any other, I think I see Member Rucker

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:50.120
and Members Patio Bronson and Rodriguez,

02:53:50.120 --> 02:53:51.840
your hands are still up in the,

02:53:53.800 --> 02:53:55.640
if you want to speak again, leave them up.

02:53:55.640 --> 02:53:57.960
If not, you can take them down.

02:53:57.960 --> 02:53:58.780
Member Rucker.

02:53:59.760 --> 02:54:04.760
Okay, so I just want to clarify what just happened.

02:54:06.920 --> 02:54:09.080
I thought I understood the conversation

02:54:09.080 --> 02:54:11.840
until we got more into the detail.

02:54:11.840 --> 02:54:15.080
So I want to make sure I understand what we're looking at.

02:54:15.080 --> 02:54:20.000
So there's a great deal of concern about the universe,

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:24.720
the language in the plan concerning the universal screener.

02:54:24.720 --> 02:54:29.160
Not only what it says about the intent or the purpose,

02:54:29.160 --> 02:54:32.760
but also what the source of that information

02:54:32.760 --> 02:54:35.320
was coming from our dyslexia guidance

02:54:35.320 --> 02:54:38.400
about the use of the screener and when to use the screener.

02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:43.160
So did I hear correctly that the idea right now

02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:46.520
is to make an edit that would just simply remove

02:54:46.520 --> 02:54:48.560
those paragraphs, is that correct?

02:54:49.400 --> 02:54:54.400
That is what I am proposing if others agree

02:54:55.400 --> 02:55:00.360
that that should be a addition amendment to the motion.

02:55:00.360 --> 02:55:03.880
Okay, so then in removing those paragraphs,

02:55:03.880 --> 02:55:08.880
we have not removed from the plan the expectation

02:55:08.960 --> 02:55:12.580
that the seven county offices who are the subgrantees

02:55:12.580 --> 02:55:14.600
will in some way be accountable

02:55:14.600 --> 02:55:19.600
for creating an assessment plan to deal with this issue,

02:55:19.880 --> 02:55:22.960
but it'll be based on the guidance that we currently have

02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:25.360
and we're looking at this as a living document.

02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:29.480
So it could be revised or improved over time,

02:55:29.480 --> 02:55:33.680
but it doesn't remove the expectation about an assessment

02:55:33.680 --> 02:55:36.120
and monitoring plan from the work

02:55:36.120 --> 02:55:39.560
that the subgrantee should be doing, is that correct?

02:55:39.560 --> 02:55:42.520
That would be my expectation, that's right.

02:55:42.520 --> 02:55:43.360
All right.

02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:46.160
We can always add, we don't have to,

02:55:47.240 --> 02:55:51.240
we can supplement this plan with additional guidance

02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:53.600
on screening when we've had an opportunity

02:55:53.600 --> 02:55:56.640
to really evaluate that and make clearer

02:55:56.640 --> 02:55:58.120
what the intentions are.

02:55:58.120 --> 02:56:00.160
Right, and so in making this revision,

02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:02.560
it's not necessary for us to have that language

02:56:02.560 --> 02:56:06.160
in this plan in order to go forward with approving the plan

02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:08.600
so that we continue the work that we're required to do

02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:11.160
under federal responsibility.

02:56:11.160 --> 02:56:13.480
We have an obligation to approve the plan,

02:56:13.480 --> 02:56:16.040
but our conversation about this work

02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:19.080
and about the guidance the plan is intended to provide

02:56:19.080 --> 02:56:21.360
doesn't end with this action today.

02:56:21.360 --> 02:56:22.360
Exactly.

02:56:22.360 --> 02:56:24.280
All right, I'm all caught up.

02:56:24.280 --> 02:56:27.600
Thank you so much for letting me ask those questions.

02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:29.840
Well, I'm sure everybody had that same question,

02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:31.360
so thank you for asking it.

02:56:32.800 --> 02:56:35.440
And I'm looking to see if anyone else wants to

02:56:37.120 --> 02:56:38.440
weigh in on the discussion.

02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:40.720
I'm not seeing any other hands.

02:56:40.720 --> 02:56:43.320
Is there any other discussion?

02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:48.560
I would like to invite a motion

02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:49.960
that we approve the plan

02:56:49.960 --> 02:56:54.960
with the elimination of those specific paragraphs.

02:56:56.720 --> 02:57:01.720
And I see, oh, I see two hands are up,

02:57:02.320 --> 02:57:04.600
Vice President Strauss and then Member Rucker.

02:57:05.480 --> 02:57:07.720
So I'll move approval of the plan

02:57:07.720 --> 02:57:10.280
with the elimination of the two paragraphs

02:57:10.280 --> 02:57:12.520
identified by Board President Darling-Hammond.

02:57:13.560 --> 02:57:15.920
And I will second that motion.

02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:16.760
Excellent.

02:57:16.760 --> 02:57:18.280
Is there any further discussion?

02:57:20.840 --> 02:57:23.560
All right, I think that Brooks has had to step away,

02:57:23.560 --> 02:57:25.640
so Judy Sias will call the roll.

02:57:26.960 --> 02:57:28.280
Yes, Member Thun?

02:57:29.560 --> 02:57:30.400
Aye, yes.

02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:33.160
Vice President Strauss?

02:57:33.160 --> 02:57:34.000
Yes.

02:57:35.160 --> 02:57:36.480
Member Rucker?

02:57:36.480 --> 02:57:37.320
Yes.

02:57:38.360 --> 02:57:39.880
Member Rodriguez?

02:57:39.880 --> 02:57:40.720
Yes.

02:57:41.640 --> 02:57:43.280
Member Patil-Bronson?

02:57:43.280 --> 02:57:44.120
Yes.

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:46.240
Member Nauvo?

02:57:46.240 --> 02:57:47.080
Yes.

02:57:47.920 --> 02:57:49.480
Member McQuillin?

02:57:49.480 --> 02:57:50.320
Yes.

02:57:51.160 --> 02:57:52.880
Member Glover-Woods?

02:57:52.880 --> 02:57:53.720
Yes.

02:57:54.680 --> 02:57:56.000
Member Fatah?

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:57.520
Yes.

02:57:57.520 --> 02:57:59.120
President Darling-Hammond?

02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:00.600
Yes.

02:58:00.600 --> 02:58:02.000
And Member Burke?

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:02.840
Aye.

02:58:03.800 --> 02:58:06.360
Great, the motion carries, thank you.

02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:07.920
Terrific.

02:58:07.920 --> 02:58:09.680
Thank you very much and thank you, Barbara,

02:58:09.680 --> 02:58:11.960
for all of the hard work on this plan

02:58:11.960 --> 02:58:13.240
and please convey our thanks

02:58:13.240 --> 02:58:15.800
to all the members of the team that were involved

02:58:16.320 --> 02:58:17.680
and we also appreciate the stakeholders

02:58:17.680 --> 02:58:21.520
raising concerns that have raised for us

02:58:21.520 --> 02:58:23.840
the opportunity to delve deeper

02:58:23.840 --> 02:58:26.640
into this whole issue of screening,

02:58:26.640 --> 02:58:28.440
which I hope will come back to us

02:58:28.440 --> 02:58:32.880
so that we can get smarter and more focused

02:58:32.880 --> 02:58:36.520
on how to proceed with that relatively soon.

02:58:36.520 --> 02:58:38.760
And with that, we're doing well.

02:58:38.760 --> 02:58:41.760
I'm going to call a lunch break.

02:58:41.920 --> 02:58:43.640
It's 11.48.

02:58:43.640 --> 02:58:47.680
We'll give you 32 minutes for lunch.

02:58:47.680 --> 02:58:50.840
Let's come back at 20 minutes after 12.

02:58:51.880 --> 02:58:54.440
Turn off your microphones and videos,

02:58:54.440 --> 02:58:56.160
but do not leave the meeting.

02:58:56.160 --> 02:58:57.000
Thank you.

02:59:01.440 --> 02:59:04.720
All right, welcome back.

02:59:04.720 --> 02:59:07.200
We are going to reestablish our quorum

02:59:07.200 --> 02:59:09.920
and Judy Sias is going to help us take the role.

02:59:10.920 --> 02:59:12.200
Member Sun?

02:59:12.200 --> 02:59:13.600
Here.

02:59:13.600 --> 02:59:15.200
Vice President Strauss?

02:59:15.200 --> 02:59:16.640
Here.

02:59:16.640 --> 02:59:17.760
Member Rucker?

02:59:17.760 --> 02:59:19.160
Here.

02:59:19.160 --> 02:59:20.640
Member Rodriguez?

02:59:20.640 --> 02:59:22.120
Here.

02:59:22.120 --> 02:59:23.880
Member Patil Bronson?

02:59:23.880 --> 02:59:25.040
Here.

02:59:25.040 --> 02:59:26.320
Member Navo?

02:59:26.320 --> 02:59:27.360
Here.

02:59:27.360 --> 02:59:28.200
Member McQuillan?

02:59:29.720 --> 02:59:31.200
Here.

02:59:31.200 --> 02:59:33.160
Member Glover Woods?

02:59:33.160 --> 02:59:34.320
Here.

02:59:34.320 --> 02:59:35.720
Member Fatah?

02:59:35.720 --> 02:59:37.040
Here.

02:59:37.040 --> 02:59:38.640
Member Darling Hammond?

02:59:38.640 --> 02:59:39.840
Here.

02:59:40.760 --> 02:59:41.600
Member Burr?

02:59:44.160 --> 02:59:45.480
Okay, we have Quam.

02:59:46.920 --> 02:59:48.760
Okay.

02:59:48.760 --> 02:59:52.840
So we are going to take up regular consent items

02:59:52.840 --> 02:59:56.360
five and six, and we'll open the phone line

02:59:56.360 --> 02:59:58.080
for the queue for public comment.

02:59:58.080 --> 03:00:03.080
We need the public comment slide to be put up.

03:00:04.960 --> 03:00:06.280
Thank you very much.

03:00:06.400 --> 03:00:09.200
So members of the public wishing to provide comment

03:00:09.200 --> 03:00:13.160
on regular consent items five and six

03:00:13.160 --> 03:00:15.960
may do so by calling the telephone number

03:00:15.960 --> 03:00:18.840
and using the access code provided on the slide

03:00:18.840 --> 03:00:20.880
that is shown now.

03:00:20.880 --> 03:00:25.240
And there really is no board discussion before that.

03:00:25.240 --> 03:00:27.760
So are there any public comments

03:00:27.760 --> 03:00:30.480
on regular consent items five and six?

03:00:31.840 --> 03:00:34.760
There does not appear to be any one for public comment

03:00:34.800 --> 03:00:36.040
for items five and six.

03:00:37.400 --> 03:00:38.240
All right.

03:00:39.720 --> 03:00:41.280
Given that there's no public comment,

03:00:41.280 --> 03:00:45.280
I'll ask a motion on consent for items five and six.

03:00:46.280 --> 03:00:47.160
Do I have a motion?

03:00:49.120 --> 03:00:49.960
I'll move.

03:00:50.960 --> 03:00:51.800
Thank you.

03:00:51.800 --> 03:00:52.760
A second?

03:00:52.760 --> 03:00:54.080
I'll second that.

03:00:54.080 --> 03:00:55.120
Thank you very much.

03:00:56.840 --> 03:00:58.640
We'll now hold a roll call vote.

03:00:58.640 --> 03:01:01.360
And Judy, will you please call the roll?

03:01:01.360 --> 03:01:02.200
Yes.

03:01:02.200 --> 03:01:03.040
Member Sun?

03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:04.120
Aye.

03:01:04.120 --> 03:01:05.320
Member Strauss?

03:01:05.320 --> 03:01:06.160
Yes.

03:01:06.160 --> 03:01:07.840
Vice President Strauss, I'm sorry.

03:01:07.840 --> 03:01:08.960
No problem.

03:01:08.960 --> 03:01:10.200
Member Rucker?

03:01:10.200 --> 03:01:11.400
Yes.

03:01:11.400 --> 03:01:13.360
Member Rodriguez?

03:01:13.360 --> 03:01:14.680
Yes.

03:01:14.680 --> 03:01:16.400
Member Patil Bronson?

03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:17.720
Yes.

03:01:17.720 --> 03:01:18.720
Member Navo?

03:01:18.720 --> 03:01:20.160
Yes.

03:01:20.160 --> 03:01:21.640
Member McQuillan?

03:01:21.640 --> 03:01:23.120
Yes.

03:01:23.120 --> 03:01:24.840
Member Glover Woods?

03:01:24.840 --> 03:01:26.200
Yes.

03:01:26.200 --> 03:01:27.520
Member Fatah?

03:01:27.520 --> 03:01:29.120
Yes.

03:01:29.120 --> 03:01:30.920
President Darling-Hammond?

03:01:30.920 --> 03:01:31.760
Yes.

03:01:32.600 --> 03:01:33.440
Member Burr?

03:01:34.920 --> 03:01:36.240
Okay, Member Burr.

03:01:36.240 --> 03:01:37.560
Okay, motion carries.

03:01:39.160 --> 03:01:40.680
Okay.

03:01:40.680 --> 03:01:44.800
So we are going to continue now

03:01:44.800 --> 03:01:47.120
with our waiver consent calendar,

03:01:47.120 --> 03:01:51.360
which includes waiver items W2 through 11.

03:01:51.360 --> 03:01:53.640
And we will again open the phone line

03:01:53.640 --> 03:01:55.760
for the public comment queue.

03:01:55.760 --> 03:01:59.240
And I'll just note again that members of the public

03:01:59.240 --> 03:02:02.040
wishing to provide comments on any of these items

03:02:02.040 --> 03:02:04.640
may do so by calling in now

03:02:04.640 --> 03:02:06.840
to the telephone number provided

03:02:06.840 --> 03:02:09.080
and the access code on the slide.

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:12.680
Are there any public comments on waiver items

03:02:12.680 --> 03:02:13.880
two through 11?

03:02:15.960 --> 03:02:18.200
We might have one person for public comment.

03:02:18.200 --> 03:02:19.800
I will open the phone lines now.

03:02:22.720 --> 03:02:23.560
Good afternoon.

03:02:23.560 --> 03:02:25.360
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:02:25.360 --> 03:02:26.200
You have one minute.

03:02:26.200 --> 03:02:27.240
Your time starts now.

03:02:29.520 --> 03:02:30.360
Good afternoon, caller.

03:02:30.360 --> 03:02:31.200
Are you there?

03:02:32.960 --> 03:02:37.000
Okay, I think this person is probably on the line

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.280
wanting to speak towards item number eight.

03:02:39.280 --> 03:02:43.280
So this concludes public comment for this item

03:02:43.280 --> 03:02:46.640
for waivers two through 11.

03:02:48.080 --> 03:02:48.920
All right.

03:02:53.920 --> 03:02:55.240
I just heard somebody say muted,

03:02:55.240 --> 03:02:57.400
but I think I'm being too loud.

03:02:57.400 --> 03:02:59.680
I'm gonna say muted, but I think I'm being heard.

03:02:59.680 --> 03:03:00.600
Am I being heard?

03:03:01.480 --> 03:03:02.320
Yes?

03:03:02.320 --> 03:03:03.320
Okay.

03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:06.480
Do I have a motion on waiver items two through 11?

03:03:07.480 --> 03:03:08.320
Unmuted.

03:03:13.200 --> 03:03:14.520
Do I have a motion?

03:03:14.520 --> 03:03:16.080
I'll move approval.

03:03:16.080 --> 03:03:16.920
Thank you.

03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:17.840
Do I have a second?

03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:18.920
I'll second.

03:03:18.920 --> 03:03:20.120
Thank you very much.

03:03:21.080 --> 03:03:22.880
We'll now hold a roll call vote.

03:03:22.880 --> 03:03:24.880
Judy, will you call the roll?

03:03:24.880 --> 03:03:25.920
Yes, Member Sun.

03:03:28.400 --> 03:03:31.360
Sorry, a meeting.

03:03:31.360 --> 03:03:32.680
Okay.

03:03:32.680 --> 03:03:33.600
Yes.

03:03:33.600 --> 03:03:34.800
Member Strauss?

03:03:34.800 --> 03:03:36.200
Yes.

03:03:36.200 --> 03:03:37.040
Member Rucker?

03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:40.560
Yes.

03:03:40.560 --> 03:03:42.040
Member Rodriguez?

03:03:42.040 --> 03:03:42.880
Yes.

03:03:43.760 --> 03:03:45.440
Member Patil Bronson?

03:03:45.440 --> 03:03:47.000
Yes.

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:48.120
Member Navo?

03:03:48.120 --> 03:03:49.760
Yes.

03:03:49.760 --> 03:03:51.200
Member McQuillin?

03:03:51.200 --> 03:03:52.040
Yes.

03:03:52.840 --> 03:03:54.560
Member Glover Woods?

03:03:54.560 --> 03:03:56.000
Yes.

03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:57.280
Member Fatah?

03:03:58.160 --> 03:03:59.000
Yes.

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:00.360
President Darling-Hammond?

03:04:00.360 --> 03:04:01.880
Yes.

03:04:01.880 --> 03:04:02.720
And Member Burr?

03:04:04.520 --> 03:04:05.560
Okay, motion carries.

03:04:08.240 --> 03:04:11.200
Okay, so we'll now take a waiver item one,

03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:13.440
which is a waiver request by the Whitmore Union

03:04:13.440 --> 03:04:15.640
Elementary School District to waive portions

03:04:15.640 --> 03:04:18.000
of the California Code of Regulations,

03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:21.160
Title V, Section 11963.6,

03:04:21.160 --> 03:04:24.200
which relate to the submission of an action

03:04:24.200 --> 03:04:26.600
on a determination of funding request

03:04:26.600 --> 03:04:29.880
regarding non-classroom-based instruction.

03:04:29.880 --> 03:04:32.280
The CDE recommends approval,

03:04:32.280 --> 03:04:35.200
and this item will be presented by Stephanie Farland.

03:04:35.200 --> 03:04:39.520
From the CDE, this waiver is related to the next item,

03:04:39.520 --> 03:04:42.760
item seven, the funding determination request

03:04:42.760 --> 03:04:44.200
for the school.

03:04:44.200 --> 03:04:46.240
So Stephanie, please begin.

03:04:47.880 --> 03:04:49.160
Thank you.

03:04:49.160 --> 03:04:54.160
Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond, Board.

03:04:56.720 --> 03:05:01.720
So today we are looking at a waiver

03:05:03.200 --> 03:05:06.160
for the New Day Academy that was

03:05:08.520 --> 03:05:12.120
because they missed their funding determination deadline.

03:05:12.120 --> 03:05:15.640
And so just a little background,

03:05:15.640 --> 03:05:19.240
they did not submit a funding determination

03:05:19.240 --> 03:05:21.840
by the February 1 regulatory deadline.

03:05:23.040 --> 03:05:24.880
A little background on New Day Academy,

03:05:24.880 --> 03:05:27.200
it's operated by New Day Academy, Inc.,

03:05:27.200 --> 03:05:30.320
and they originally planned to close at the end

03:05:30.320 --> 03:05:32.280
this particular school,

03:05:36.760 --> 03:05:39.640
they planned to close at the end of fiscal year 2019-20

03:05:39.640 --> 03:05:41.080
to come into compliance

03:05:41.080 --> 03:05:43.920
with the geographic location requirements

03:05:43.920 --> 03:05:46.640
outlined in AB 1507,

03:05:46.640 --> 03:05:49.720
as it currently operates a site outside of its authorizing,

03:05:49.720 --> 03:05:52.680
or did outside of its authorizing district boundaries.

03:05:52.680 --> 03:05:54.600
Because it was planning to close,

03:05:55.320 --> 03:05:57.440
it did not submit a funding determination

03:05:57.440 --> 03:06:00.160
for renewal in February of 2020.

03:06:00.160 --> 03:06:03.120
New Day Academy's closure plans included transferring

03:06:03.120 --> 03:06:05.320
some of its students to Chassevue Academy,

03:06:05.320 --> 03:06:08.360
another school operated by New Day Academy, Inc.,

03:06:08.360 --> 03:06:10.040
which is authorized by and located

03:06:10.040 --> 03:06:12.680
in the Columbia Elementary School District.

03:06:12.680 --> 03:06:17.680
However, because of Senate Bills 98 and 820

03:06:17.880 --> 03:06:19.360
introduced last year,

03:06:21.400 --> 03:06:23.080
it introduced funding model changes

03:06:23.080 --> 03:06:25.520
for the 2021 school year.

03:06:25.520 --> 03:06:29.080
2019-20 average daily attendance is being used

03:06:29.080 --> 03:06:32.960
to calculate funding for 2020-2021.

03:06:32.960 --> 03:06:35.960
As such, Chassevue Academy would not be able

03:06:35.960 --> 03:06:39.840
to claim revenues associated with any student transfers

03:06:39.840 --> 03:06:44.840
from New Day Academy to the Chassevue Academy.

03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:49.280
So it was then that they decided to reverse its closure.

03:06:50.080 --> 03:06:50.920
Next slide.

03:06:53.120 --> 03:06:55.240
Upon deciding to reverse its closure,

03:06:55.240 --> 03:06:58.040
Whitmore Union Elementary submitted a waiver

03:06:58.040 --> 03:07:00.360
to the State Board for New Day Academy

03:07:00.360 --> 03:07:02.040
to submit a funding determination

03:07:02.040 --> 03:07:03.880
after the regulatory deadline.

03:07:03.880 --> 03:07:04.720
With their waiver,

03:07:04.720 --> 03:07:07.320
Whitmore Union Elementary included information

03:07:07.320 --> 03:07:11.000
regarding New Day Academy's compliance with AB 1507.

03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:13.920
Both Whitmore Union Elementary and New Day Academy

03:07:13.920 --> 03:07:16.200
confirm that the school is currently in compliance

03:07:16.200 --> 03:07:18.040
with AB 1507.

03:07:18.040 --> 03:07:20.520
The school previously operated a resource center

03:07:20.520 --> 03:07:23.320
outside of the school's authorizing district boundaries.

03:07:23.320 --> 03:07:25.240
However, that resource center was closed

03:07:25.240 --> 03:07:27.160
on June 30th, 2020.

03:07:27.160 --> 03:07:29.320
The school no longer operates a resource center

03:07:29.320 --> 03:07:31.560
outside of its authorizing district's boundaries

03:07:31.560 --> 03:07:34.280
and all program services are now delivered

03:07:34.280 --> 03:07:36.240
via an independent study model.

03:07:39.760 --> 03:07:42.200
The California Department of Education is recommending

03:07:42.200 --> 03:07:44.000
that the State Board approve the request

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:45.600
by Whitmore Union Elementary

03:07:45.640 --> 03:07:47.040
School District to waive portions

03:07:47.040 --> 03:07:52.040
of California Code of Regulation, Section 11963.6C,

03:07:52.400 --> 03:07:54.160
relating to the submission deadline

03:07:54.160 --> 03:07:56.440
in order to allow New Day Academy

03:07:56.440 --> 03:07:58.680
to submit a determination of funding request

03:07:58.680 --> 03:08:00.560
after the regulatory deadline.

03:08:00.560 --> 03:08:03.400
Approval of this waiver request will allow the State Board

03:08:03.400 --> 03:08:05.640
to consider a retroactive determination

03:08:05.640 --> 03:08:07.440
of funding requests from the school,

03:08:07.440 --> 03:08:09.800
which is what you will hear next.

03:08:09.800 --> 03:08:11.000
Without an approved waiver,

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:13.840
the State Board may not be able to approve the waiver

03:08:14.640 --> 03:08:17.600
The State Board may not consider the retroactive request

03:08:17.600 --> 03:08:20.600
and the charter school's non-classroom-based ADA

03:08:20.600 --> 03:08:23.600
may not be funded for the affected fiscal years.

03:08:30.640 --> 03:08:32.880
So that's the waiver portion

03:08:32.880 --> 03:08:34.840
of this particular presentation.

03:08:43.840 --> 03:08:45.720
Is there anything else you wanted to know

03:08:45.720 --> 03:08:47.200
before we go to public comment?

03:08:47.200 --> 03:08:48.040
No.

03:08:48.040 --> 03:08:49.200
Okay, very good.

03:08:49.200 --> 03:08:52.200
Before we go to public comment, as people are queuing up,

03:08:52.200 --> 03:08:54.560
I want to ask Member Rucker as our waiver liaison

03:08:54.560 --> 03:08:56.760
if she has any initial comments.

03:08:59.280 --> 03:09:04.280
No, these types of waivers are usually something we've done

03:09:04.280 --> 03:09:06.520
in due course, as Stephanie has noted,

03:09:06.520 --> 03:09:10.480
this is not waiving the waiver request.

03:09:10.480 --> 03:09:11.480
Stephanie has noted,

03:09:11.480 --> 03:09:16.480
this is not waiving consideration of the request.

03:09:17.120 --> 03:09:19.560
This is simply creating the flexibility

03:09:19.560 --> 03:09:22.480
so that the application for the consideration

03:09:22.480 --> 03:09:24.280
of the request can go forward.

03:09:24.280 --> 03:09:28.600
And I know it's confusing to have both the waiver

03:09:28.600 --> 03:09:32.760
as well as the action on the same agenda.

03:09:32.760 --> 03:09:34.560
I have concerns about that as well

03:09:34.560 --> 03:09:36.900
because of the concern about allowing time

03:09:36.900 --> 03:09:38.360
for a public vetting,

03:09:38.360 --> 03:09:41.120
but there are some timeline concerns

03:09:41.120 --> 03:09:46.120
and that to support the request itself that were important

03:09:46.120 --> 03:09:48.720
and that's why the staff had recommended putting

03:09:48.720 --> 03:09:51.520
both this waiver and the action that's separate

03:09:51.520 --> 03:09:52.600
on the same agenda.

03:09:52.600 --> 03:09:55.240
And Judy can cover any of those concerns

03:09:55.240 --> 03:09:57.200
if you all have questions about that

03:09:57.200 --> 03:10:00.160
that you want to discuss after the public comment.

03:10:00.160 --> 03:10:01.480
Great.

03:10:01.480 --> 03:10:04.400
Are there any clarifying questions

03:10:04.400 --> 03:10:06.080
before we go to public comment?

03:10:08.640 --> 03:10:11.600
All right, let's see if there's any public comment.

03:10:11.600 --> 03:10:13.640
Okay, I think we have one person signed up

03:10:13.640 --> 03:10:14.480
for public comment.

03:10:14.480 --> 03:10:16.920
I will open the phone line or actually two people.

03:10:16.920 --> 03:10:18.520
I will open the phone line now.

03:10:20.640 --> 03:10:22.400
Good afternoon, State Board of Education.

03:10:22.400 --> 03:10:24.680
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:10:24.680 --> 03:10:25.520
You have one minute.

03:10:25.520 --> 03:10:26.620
Your time starts now.

03:10:34.440 --> 03:10:35.680
Good afternoon, caller.

03:10:35.680 --> 03:10:37.840
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:10:37.840 --> 03:10:39.160
Your time starts now.

03:10:48.680 --> 03:10:50.440
Hello, my name is Michael Jubba

03:10:50.440 --> 03:10:53.760
and I represent the California Teachers Association.

03:10:53.760 --> 03:10:56.160
CTA is concerned with procedural steps

03:10:56.160 --> 03:10:58.600
taken in regard to this waiver.

03:10:58.600 --> 03:11:02.000
As highlighted on page one of the item, and I quote,

03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:04.480
the CDE notes that typically

03:11:04.480 --> 03:11:07.480
retroactive funding determination requests

03:11:07.520 --> 03:11:11.960
are presented to the ACCS after an approved waiver

03:11:11.960 --> 03:11:13.960
from the SBE has been received.

03:11:15.040 --> 03:11:16.840
On page two of the attachment,

03:11:16.840 --> 03:11:19.880
CDE clearly states that the New Day Academy

03:11:19.880 --> 03:11:23.840
has submitted an SB 740 funding determination

03:11:23.840 --> 03:11:28.080
for the 2021 school year concurrently with this waiver,

03:11:28.080 --> 03:11:32.400
with the understanding that upon waiver approval,

03:11:32.400 --> 03:11:36.920
the funding request will be reviewed by the ACCS

03:11:36.920 --> 03:11:39.000
and required SBE approval.

03:11:39.920 --> 03:11:42.920
Based on the procedural issues outlined above,

03:11:42.920 --> 03:11:47.160
CTA questions why the CDE has allowed the process

03:11:47.160 --> 03:11:49.920
of the funding determination to move forward

03:11:49.920 --> 03:11:52.320
without the waiver being approved.

03:11:52.320 --> 03:11:53.560
Thank you.

03:11:53.560 --> 03:11:54.380
Thank you.

03:11:57.160 --> 03:11:58.000
All right.

03:11:58.000 --> 03:11:58.820
Good afternoon.

03:11:58.820 --> 03:12:00.520
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:12:00.520 --> 03:12:01.360
You have one minute.

03:12:01.360 --> 03:12:02.420
Your time starts now.

03:12:04.280 --> 03:12:05.240
Hello, it's Eric Premack

03:12:05.240 --> 03:12:06.640
with the Charter Schools Development Center

03:12:07.320 --> 03:12:10.760
speaking in favor of the staff recommendation on W01.

03:12:10.760 --> 03:12:13.280
It's a longstanding reputable school.

03:12:13.280 --> 03:12:17.360
The request here is in very much in alignment

03:12:17.360 --> 03:12:21.200
with very similar waivers you've granted in the past,

03:12:21.200 --> 03:12:24.800
and we support it and the related item seven.

03:12:24.800 --> 03:12:25.880
Thank you.

03:12:25.880 --> 03:12:26.720
Thank you.

03:12:30.120 --> 03:12:31.040
Good afternoon, caller.

03:12:31.040 --> 03:12:33.160
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:12:33.160 --> 03:12:34.000
You have one minute.

03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:35.000
Your time starts now.

03:12:37.640 --> 03:12:41.840
Okay, it looks like that concludes public comment

03:12:41.840 --> 03:12:42.680
for this item.

03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:48.600
Okay, with that, are there any comments

03:12:48.600 --> 03:12:52.800
from members of the board about this item?

03:12:55.320 --> 03:12:58.120
Trying to get my participant list to show up here.

03:12:59.480 --> 03:13:01.120
It's not responding.

03:13:01.120 --> 03:13:05.560
So if you have a comment, please holler at me

03:13:05.560 --> 03:13:08.920
because I'm not getting a response from my computer.

03:13:11.080 --> 03:13:12.360
Okay, I don't see any.

03:13:12.360 --> 03:13:13.580
Do we have a motion?

03:13:14.920 --> 03:13:19.080
So I will move approval of what is recommended

03:13:19.080 --> 03:13:22.740
in this waiver concerning this charter school.

03:13:22.740 --> 03:13:25.380
And again, I wanna remind my colleagues on the board,

03:13:25.380 --> 03:13:29.240
this motion is separate from what you will be asked

03:13:29.240 --> 03:13:33.820
to consider on a separate action item on today's agenda.

03:13:34.820 --> 03:13:37.260
All right, is there a second?

03:13:37.260 --> 03:13:38.900
I'll second the motion.

03:13:38.900 --> 03:13:42.660
Okay, any further discussion?

03:13:42.660 --> 03:13:44.100
Can we have a roll call vote?

03:13:45.260 --> 03:13:47.060
Yes, member Sun?

03:13:47.060 --> 03:13:47.900
Aye.

03:13:48.860 --> 03:13:50.260
Vice President Strauss?

03:13:50.260 --> 03:13:51.100
Yes.

03:13:52.460 --> 03:13:53.460
Member Rucker?

03:13:53.460 --> 03:13:54.300
Yes.

03:13:55.580 --> 03:13:56.900
Member Rodriguez?

03:13:56.900 --> 03:13:57.740
Yes.

03:13:59.340 --> 03:14:00.980
Member Patil Bronson?

03:14:00.980 --> 03:14:01.820
Yes.

03:14:02.580 --> 03:14:04.100
Member Navo?

03:14:04.100 --> 03:14:04.940
Yes.

03:14:05.820 --> 03:14:07.500
Member McQuillan?

03:14:07.500 --> 03:14:09.060
Yes.

03:14:09.060 --> 03:14:10.820
Member Glover-Woods?

03:14:10.820 --> 03:14:11.660
Yes.

03:14:12.500 --> 03:14:13.740
Member Fatah?

03:14:13.740 --> 03:14:15.140
Yes.

03:14:15.140 --> 03:14:16.860
President Darling-Hammond?

03:14:16.860 --> 03:14:18.180
Yes.

03:14:18.180 --> 03:14:19.220
Member Burr?

03:14:19.220 --> 03:14:20.420
Aye.

03:14:20.420 --> 03:14:21.700
Okay, the motion carries.

03:14:23.260 --> 03:14:25.020
All right, thank you.

03:14:25.300 --> 03:14:30.300
So item seven is the consideration

03:14:32.380 --> 03:14:35.820
of a retroactive request for determination of funding

03:14:35.820 --> 03:14:38.020
as required for non-classroom-based charter schools

03:14:38.020 --> 03:14:39.900
pursuant to California Education Code,

03:14:39.900 --> 03:14:44.900
sections 47612.5 and 47634.2,

03:14:45.500 --> 03:14:48.820
and associated California Code of Regulations, Title V.

03:14:49.900 --> 03:14:53.060
And so the CDE recommends that the SBE approve

03:14:53.060 --> 03:14:56.020
the determination of funding request at the percentage

03:14:56.020 --> 03:14:58.300
and for the time period as specified

03:14:58.300 --> 03:15:00.700
for New Day Academy and Attachment One.

03:15:01.620 --> 03:15:05.260
And CDE notes that it's funding determination recommendation

03:15:06.260 --> 03:15:10.060
as well as the recommendation moved by ACCSR contingent

03:15:10.060 --> 03:15:15.060
upon approving waiver number 5-9-2020 at this meeting,

03:15:16.180 --> 03:15:17.740
which we just approved.

03:15:17.740 --> 03:15:21.260
This item will be presented by Stephanie Farland of the CDE.

03:15:21.260 --> 03:15:22.580
Stephanie, please begin.

03:15:23.100 --> 03:15:26.100
Hi, I'm actually gonna let McKenna Huey,

03:15:26.100 --> 03:15:28.620
who does all of our funding determinations,

03:15:28.620 --> 03:15:31.260
present this particular item.

03:15:31.260 --> 03:15:32.980
I will say before she starts

03:15:32.980 --> 03:15:37.180
that the determination did go to these last months,

03:15:37.180 --> 03:15:39.260
so we didn't skip any steps in terms of that.

03:15:39.260 --> 03:15:43.180
They heard the funding determination and they approved it,

03:15:43.180 --> 03:15:45.260
and they knew that was contingent

03:15:45.260 --> 03:15:47.700
upon this waiver being approved.

03:15:48.660 --> 03:15:49.500
So McKenna?

03:15:50.500 --> 03:15:54.660
All right, good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond

03:15:54.660 --> 03:15:56.140
and members of the State Board.

03:15:56.140 --> 03:15:57.260
My name is McKenna Huey,

03:15:57.260 --> 03:15:58.900
representing the Charter Schools Division,

03:15:58.900 --> 03:16:01.180
and I'll be presenting item seven.

03:16:04.820 --> 03:16:08.180
So item seven consists of a retroactive request

03:16:08.180 --> 03:16:09.580
for determination of funding

03:16:09.580 --> 03:16:12.500
for one renewing non-classroom-based charter school,

03:16:12.500 --> 03:16:14.260
and that's New Day Academy.

03:16:14.260 --> 03:16:16.740
So as has been previously mentioned,

03:16:16.740 --> 03:16:19.300
typically retroactive funding determination requests

03:16:20.100 --> 03:16:21.700
are presented to the State Board at a separate meeting

03:16:21.700 --> 03:16:24.180
after the school's waiver has already been heard

03:16:24.180 --> 03:16:25.340
and approved.

03:16:25.340 --> 03:16:27.420
However, in an effort just to minimize

03:16:27.420 --> 03:16:30.020
some of the negative fiscal impacts to the school

03:16:30.020 --> 03:16:33.620
as this request was submitted so late in the year,

03:16:33.620 --> 03:16:35.220
it was decided that both the waiver

03:16:35.220 --> 03:16:38.060
and the funding determination item would be heard

03:16:38.060 --> 03:16:39.780
by the State Board at one meeting.

03:16:41.540 --> 03:16:44.100
And as Stephanie just mentioned,

03:16:44.100 --> 03:16:46.060
this item was brought to the Advisory Commission

03:16:46.060 --> 03:16:48.340
on Charter Schools at its February meeting,

03:16:48.420 --> 03:16:52.300
and at that meeting, CDE staff did inform the ACCS

03:16:52.300 --> 03:16:54.180
that its recommendation was contingent

03:16:54.180 --> 03:16:57.820
upon the State Board approving the waiver for this school.

03:17:00.380 --> 03:17:05.380
So as this waiver request has now been approved,

03:17:06.460 --> 03:17:08.980
the State Board may act on the school's

03:17:08.980 --> 03:17:10.980
funding determination request.

03:17:10.980 --> 03:17:14.820
So the CDE staff reviewed the funding determination form

03:17:14.820 --> 03:17:16.580
submitted by New Day Academy,

03:17:16.620 --> 03:17:18.940
and upon its review, the CDE determined

03:17:18.940 --> 03:17:21.340
that New Day Academy meets the requirements

03:17:21.340 --> 03:17:24.660
for a recommendation of 100% funding.

03:17:24.660 --> 03:17:28.220
New Day Academy spent over 40% of its public revenues

03:17:28.220 --> 03:17:31.820
on salaries and benefits for all certificated employees.

03:17:31.820 --> 03:17:34.580
They also spent over 80% of its total revenues

03:17:34.580 --> 03:17:36.980
on instruction and related services.

03:17:36.980 --> 03:17:39.540
And finally, they maintained a people to teacher ratio

03:17:39.540 --> 03:17:42.020
less than 25 to one.

03:17:42.020 --> 03:17:44.340
So detailed information regarding the school's revenues

03:17:44.380 --> 03:17:45.940
and expenditures can be found

03:17:45.940 --> 03:17:47.860
in its funding determination form,

03:17:47.860 --> 03:17:50.380
which is provided on the ACCS meeting agenda,

03:17:50.380 --> 03:17:52.940
as well as which is linked in the item.

03:17:56.540 --> 03:17:59.780
So in conclusion, the CDE recommends that the State Board

03:17:59.780 --> 03:18:01.740
approve the determination of funding requests

03:18:01.740 --> 03:18:04.580
for New Day Academy Charter at 100%

03:18:04.580 --> 03:18:07.300
for a period of three fiscal years.

03:18:07.300 --> 03:18:09.860
And at its February ACCS meeting,

03:18:09.860 --> 03:18:13.420
the ACCS moved to approve the CDE recommendation

03:18:13.460 --> 03:18:15.740
that the State Board approve the determination

03:18:15.740 --> 03:18:17.660
of funding request at the percentage

03:18:17.660 --> 03:18:19.660
and for the time period specified,

03:18:19.660 --> 03:18:23.460
and that motion passed by a vote of eight to one.

03:18:24.500 --> 03:18:27.300
And that concludes this presentation.

03:18:27.300 --> 03:18:30.100
I'm happy to answer any questions that the board may have.

03:18:30.180 --> 03:18:31.020
Thank you.

03:18:40.420 --> 03:18:44.100
President Hammond, I believe you're on mute.

03:18:44.100 --> 03:18:44.940
I'm sorry.

03:18:46.100 --> 03:18:49.180
We need to put the public comment slide up again,

03:18:49.180 --> 03:18:51.540
because we're gonna queue up for public comment.

03:18:52.500 --> 03:18:55.460
And while we're doing that,

03:18:55.460 --> 03:18:58.420
and I will just point for those who are queuing up

03:18:58.420 --> 03:19:01.700
that those who wanna comment can call the telephone number.

03:19:01.700 --> 03:19:05.060
I've used the access code provided on the slide.

03:19:05.060 --> 03:19:07.420
And while we're waiting for people to queue up,

03:19:07.420 --> 03:19:10.580
I'm gonna ask Member Burr and Member Sun

03:19:10.580 --> 03:19:14.340
as our charter liaisons if they have any framing comments.

03:19:14.340 --> 03:19:15.180
Member Burr?

03:19:16.380 --> 03:19:17.300
I do not.

03:19:17.300 --> 03:19:21.460
Member Sun actually, I believe attended the ACCS.

03:19:21.460 --> 03:19:23.980
I think this is self-explanatory

03:19:23.980 --> 03:19:26.500
and McKenna did a great job.

03:19:26.500 --> 03:19:28.540
Yes, I would agree.

03:19:28.540 --> 03:19:31.540
CDE does a thorough job on these funding determinations

03:19:31.540 --> 03:19:34.060
and it was approved by the ACCS.

03:19:34.060 --> 03:19:34.900
Okay.

03:19:35.820 --> 03:19:37.260
Is there any public comment?

03:19:38.260 --> 03:19:40.660
I believe we have one person signed up for public comment.

03:19:40.660 --> 03:19:42.020
I will open the phone line.

03:19:43.660 --> 03:19:44.500
Good afternoon.

03:19:44.500 --> 03:19:46.380
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:19:46.380 --> 03:19:47.220
You have one minute.

03:19:47.220 --> 03:19:48.140
Your time starts now.

03:19:53.900 --> 03:19:54.780
Good afternoon, caller.

03:19:54.780 --> 03:19:55.620
Are you there?

03:19:57.500 --> 03:19:58.500
Okay.

03:19:58.500 --> 03:20:00.900
It appears that they are probably on the line

03:20:00.900 --> 03:20:02.580
for another item.

03:20:02.580 --> 03:20:05.380
That concludes public comment for this item.

03:20:06.340 --> 03:20:07.180
All right.

03:20:07.180 --> 03:20:08.820
So I'll open this up for board discussion.

03:20:08.820 --> 03:20:11.860
Is there any board discussion on this item?

03:20:16.500 --> 03:20:19.740
I am seeing no hands.

03:20:19.740 --> 03:20:20.860
Do I have a motion?

03:20:24.140 --> 03:20:25.900
I will move approval.

03:20:26.140 --> 03:20:26.980
Thank you.

03:20:26.980 --> 03:20:28.060
Do I have a second?

03:20:28.060 --> 03:20:29.100
Second.

03:20:29.100 --> 03:20:30.900
Thank you very much.

03:20:30.900 --> 03:20:32.020
We'll call the roll.

03:20:32.020 --> 03:20:34.380
Judy, will you call the roll for the vote?

03:20:36.380 --> 03:20:37.220
Yes.

03:20:37.220 --> 03:20:38.060
Member Sun?

03:20:39.140 --> 03:20:39.980
Aye.

03:20:41.140 --> 03:20:42.660
Vice President Strauss?

03:20:42.660 --> 03:20:44.140
Yes.

03:20:44.140 --> 03:20:45.260
Member Rucker?

03:20:45.260 --> 03:20:46.100
Not voting.

03:20:49.220 --> 03:20:50.780
Member Rodriguez?

03:20:50.780 --> 03:20:51.620
Yes.

03:20:52.460 --> 03:20:53.580
Member Patio-Bronson?

03:20:56.900 --> 03:20:58.460
I think you're on mute.

03:20:59.900 --> 03:21:00.860
Can you hear me?

03:21:00.860 --> 03:21:01.700
Yes.

03:21:01.700 --> 03:21:02.540
Okay, yes.

03:21:03.540 --> 03:21:04.500
Yes, thank you.

03:21:04.500 --> 03:21:05.940
Too many yeses there.

03:21:05.940 --> 03:21:07.180
Member Navo?

03:21:07.180 --> 03:21:08.580
Yes.

03:21:08.580 --> 03:21:09.980
Member McQuillan?

03:21:09.980 --> 03:21:11.380
Yes.

03:21:11.380 --> 03:21:13.100
Member Glover-Woods?

03:21:13.100 --> 03:21:14.500
Yes.

03:21:14.500 --> 03:21:15.780
Member Fatah?

03:21:15.780 --> 03:21:16.620
Yes.

03:21:18.380 --> 03:21:19.980
President Darling-Hammond?

03:21:19.980 --> 03:21:20.820
Yes.

03:21:21.740 --> 03:21:22.700
Member Burr?

03:21:22.700 --> 03:21:23.860
Aye.

03:21:23.860 --> 03:21:25.020
Okay, motion carries.

03:21:26.260 --> 03:21:27.980
Okay, thank you.

03:21:30.100 --> 03:21:31.420
You will be surprised to learn

03:21:31.420 --> 03:21:33.580
that you've earned another break,

03:21:33.580 --> 03:21:35.900
but we have to set up for a public hearing,

03:21:35.900 --> 03:21:39.100
and that public hearing may be a more extensive one.

03:21:39.100 --> 03:21:42.540
So this is your chance to go get that cup of coffee

03:21:42.540 --> 03:21:46.100
or matcha tea or whatever you're drinking this afternoon,

03:21:46.100 --> 03:21:48.100
and we will see you back in 10 minutes.

03:21:48.100 --> 03:21:50.820
Please don't turn off your, please don't leave,

03:21:50.820 --> 03:21:52.820
just turn off your camera and your mic.

03:21:56.420 --> 03:21:58.300
We are back from our break,

03:21:58.300 --> 03:22:02.300
and so Brooks, will you call roll to establish a quorum?

03:22:02.300 --> 03:22:03.140
Of course.

03:22:30.540 --> 03:22:31.380
Member Fatah?

03:22:32.500 --> 03:22:33.540
Here.

03:22:33.540 --> 03:22:34.900
President Darling-Hammond?

03:22:36.500 --> 03:22:38.020
Member Burr?

03:22:38.020 --> 03:22:39.020
Here.

03:22:39.020 --> 03:22:39.940
We have a quorum.

03:22:41.460 --> 03:22:46.460
Okay, so we are now going to take up agenda item eight,

03:22:47.340 --> 03:22:50.140
which is a public hearing regarding a petition

03:22:50.140 --> 03:22:52.540
for the renewal of a charter school

03:22:52.540 --> 03:22:55.660
under the oversight of a local education agency

03:22:55.660 --> 03:22:58.860
designated by the State Board of Education,

03:22:58.860 --> 03:23:03.860
pursuant to California Ed Code Section 47605K2E.

03:23:04.980 --> 03:23:07.820
This is the consideration of Ross Valley Charter,

03:23:07.820 --> 03:23:10.220
which was denied by the Ross Valley

03:23:10.220 --> 03:23:12.260
Elementary School District.

03:23:12.260 --> 03:23:14.740
The CD recommends that the State Board

03:23:14.740 --> 03:23:17.580
hold a public hearing to approve the request

03:23:17.580 --> 03:23:19.740
to renew Ross Valley Charter,

03:23:19.740 --> 03:23:23.420
a transitional kindergarten through grade five charter,

03:23:23.420 --> 03:23:25.540
based on the CD findings pursuant

03:23:25.540 --> 03:23:29.460
to California Ed Code Sections 47605

03:23:29.460 --> 03:23:32.340
and California Code of Regulations Title V

03:23:32.340 --> 03:23:36.180
Section 11967.5.

03:23:36.180 --> 03:23:40.220
The CD finds that the petitioner is able

03:23:40.220 --> 03:23:43.140
to successfully implement the attended program

03:23:43.140 --> 03:23:45.220
and that the Ross Valley Charter petition

03:23:45.220 --> 03:23:48.540
is consistent with sound educational practice

03:23:48.540 --> 03:23:50.660
and meets the renewal criteria.

03:23:50.660 --> 03:23:53.820
Although the CD finds that the Ross Valley Charter petition

03:23:53.820 --> 03:23:58.060
contains overall reasonably comprehensive descriptions

03:23:58.060 --> 03:23:59.660
of the required elements,

03:23:59.660 --> 03:24:01.740
the CD has identified areas

03:24:01.740 --> 03:24:04.100
where the petition could be strengthened.

03:24:04.100 --> 03:24:07.100
The CD notes these areas in this item,

03:24:07.100 --> 03:24:10.140
as well as in the analysis of the Ross Valley Petition

03:24:10.140 --> 03:24:11.300
in attachment one.

03:24:12.300 --> 03:24:14.300
ACCS recommendation,

03:24:14.300 --> 03:24:16.380
the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools

03:24:16.380 --> 03:24:20.860
considered this petition at the February 11th, 2021,

03:24:20.860 --> 03:24:22.420
ACCS meeting.

03:24:22.420 --> 03:24:25.820
The ACCS moved the CD staff recommendation

03:24:25.820 --> 03:24:28.060
to approve the Ross Valley Charter petition

03:24:28.060 --> 03:24:30.460
by a vote of eight to one.

03:24:30.460 --> 03:24:33.180
This item will now be presented by Stephanie Farland

03:24:33.180 --> 03:24:34.420
of the CDE.

03:24:34.420 --> 03:24:36.380
So Stephanie, you may begin.

03:24:42.060 --> 03:24:42.900
Unmute.

03:24:42.900 --> 03:24:44.300
Thank you very much.

03:24:45.820 --> 03:24:48.580
Good afternoon again, Vice President Strauss,

03:24:48.580 --> 03:24:51.620
President Darling-Hammond, Board, Chief Deputy Gregson.

03:24:52.660 --> 03:24:56.700
Today we, as mentioned, we are presenting the item

03:24:56.700 --> 03:24:58.820
for the appeal of the Ross Valley Charter School

03:24:58.820 --> 03:24:59.860
renewal petition.

03:25:03.020 --> 03:25:04.420
Let's go to the first slide.

03:25:04.460 --> 03:25:06.420
So this is the first appeal

03:25:06.420 --> 03:25:09.420
since Assembly Bill 18, or 18,

03:25:09.420 --> 03:25:14.420
Assembly Bill 1505 has been implemented.

03:25:14.420 --> 03:25:18.420
However, this is not an abusive discretion appeal.

03:25:18.420 --> 03:25:23.420
So it is, while it is the first one post implementation

03:25:23.420 --> 03:25:26.420
of 1505, it is not an abusive discretion appeal.

03:25:26.420 --> 03:25:29.420
This appeal will look familiar to the State Board of Ed

03:25:29.420 --> 03:25:31.420
because it is the first one

03:25:31.540 --> 03:25:34.340
This appeal will look familiar to the State Board of Ed

03:25:34.340 --> 03:25:36.180
because the standard of review

03:25:36.180 --> 03:25:39.020
for State Board of Ed authorized charter schools

03:25:39.020 --> 03:25:41.420
requires a separate comprehensive review

03:25:44.620 --> 03:25:47.140
of the school's academic programs and fiscal health

03:25:47.140 --> 03:25:49.340
apart from the district's review and findings.

03:25:49.340 --> 03:25:53.300
So it's very similar to what we have done in the past

03:25:53.300 --> 03:25:57.100
in terms of the review that you're going to see today.

03:25:57.100 --> 03:26:00.500
That doesn't mean that there aren't any pieces of 1505

03:26:00.900 --> 03:26:03.260
that have gone into this review.

03:26:03.260 --> 03:26:07.700
For example, the school was placed

03:26:07.700 --> 03:26:09.300
in one of the performance categories

03:26:09.300 --> 03:26:10.820
that is new under 1505.

03:26:10.820 --> 03:26:13.260
They are a middle performing school.

03:26:13.260 --> 03:26:17.580
And we did use verified data for this review.

03:26:17.580 --> 03:26:19.700
So that's part of 1505 as well.

03:26:19.700 --> 03:26:22.500
So there are pieces that will look new,

03:26:22.500 --> 03:26:27.260
but for the most part, this is a comprehensive review

03:26:27.260 --> 03:26:29.660
that we call de novo that we have been doing

03:26:29.660 --> 03:26:33.180
for State Board authorized appeals for quite some time.

03:26:38.420 --> 03:26:40.980
So before we start, I wanted to,

03:26:40.980 --> 03:26:43.740
as I know there are a few new members of the board,

03:26:43.740 --> 03:26:45.700
I want to give a quick review,

03:26:45.700 --> 03:26:48.340
quick overview of the process and journey

03:26:48.340 --> 03:26:51.540
each appeal takes once it comes into our office.

03:26:51.540 --> 03:26:53.580
Once it is received, several members,

03:26:53.580 --> 03:26:55.620
once the appeal is received to the department,

03:26:55.620 --> 03:26:57.220
it is several members

03:26:57.260 --> 03:27:00.660
of the charter schools division staff review the petition

03:27:00.660 --> 03:27:04.700
and accompanying documents, including the fiscal documents

03:27:04.700 --> 03:27:08.220
and analyze to see if the school has met renewal criteria.

03:27:08.220 --> 03:27:12.260
The appeal then goes on to the CDE's legal division

03:27:12.260 --> 03:27:14.220
for a legal review.

03:27:14.220 --> 03:27:17.340
We also gather input from other divisions

03:27:17.340 --> 03:27:20.140
in the CDE as applicable.

03:27:20.140 --> 03:27:23.860
And then the final analysis of the recommendation

03:27:23.860 --> 03:27:26.780
for the board is approved by the division director,

03:27:26.780 --> 03:27:31.780
which is me, and also the branch deputy superintendent,

03:27:32.580 --> 03:27:34.820
which is currently Lisa Constancio.

03:27:34.820 --> 03:27:37.460
So it is a collaborative and group effort

03:27:37.460 --> 03:27:40.300
and ultimately a department decision

03:27:40.300 --> 03:27:43.020
when it comes to the recommendation for the State Board.

03:27:45.500 --> 03:27:46.340
Next slide.

03:27:48.020 --> 03:27:50.580
So as stated earlier, Ross Valley Charter School

03:27:50.580 --> 03:27:53.100
is seeking authorization from the SBE

03:27:53.100 --> 03:27:54.980
to renew their transitional kindergarten

03:27:54.980 --> 03:27:56.820
through grade five charter school

03:27:56.820 --> 03:27:58.620
within the boundaries of the Ross Valley

03:27:58.620 --> 03:28:00.500
Elementary School District.

03:28:00.500 --> 03:28:04.180
The petitioner saw authorization from the school district.

03:28:04.180 --> 03:28:06.340
On November 10th, the district board denied

03:28:06.340 --> 03:28:09.420
the petitioner request for renewal by a vote of five to zero.

03:28:09.420 --> 03:28:12.020
The CDE received the appeal on November 30th

03:28:12.020 --> 03:28:14.140
and the appeal went to the advisory commission

03:28:14.140 --> 03:28:16.780
on charter schools on February 11th, 2021.

03:28:20.180 --> 03:28:23.780
So the CDE recommendation is that the SBE

03:28:23.780 --> 03:28:25.860
hold a public hearing and approve the request

03:28:25.860 --> 03:28:28.380
to renew Ross Valley Charter School.

03:28:28.380 --> 03:28:31.420
And as stated earlier, the ACCS recommendation

03:28:31.420 --> 03:28:35.020
was also to recommend approval

03:28:35.020 --> 03:28:37.020
to the State Board of Education

03:28:37.020 --> 03:28:39.500
and that motion passed by a vote of eight to one.

03:28:47.820 --> 03:28:51.900
ACCS educational program is a public school option

03:28:51.900 --> 03:28:55.340
that provides a progressive education model,

03:28:55.340 --> 03:28:57.620
emphasizing deep inquiry and exploration,

03:28:57.620 --> 03:29:00.140
hands-on immersion-based experiences,

03:29:00.140 --> 03:29:02.980
active learning by doing approaches.

03:29:02.980 --> 03:29:04.900
Students collaborate effectively in teams,

03:29:04.900 --> 03:29:06.740
they think critically, they seek information

03:29:06.740 --> 03:29:09.020
to solve problems and be lifelong learners

03:29:09.020 --> 03:29:10.420
and culturally competent members

03:29:10.420 --> 03:29:12.660
of their diverse global community.

03:29:12.660 --> 03:29:17.660
So the CDE's analysis and findings and concern.

03:29:21.860 --> 03:29:24.180
We have, the Department of Ed has determined

03:29:24.180 --> 03:29:25.940
that the Ross Valley Charter School

03:29:25.940 --> 03:29:30.940
has met renewal criteria set out in Ed Code 47607C.

03:29:31.700 --> 03:29:35.220
Due to the delay in opening of the school in 2016,

03:29:35.220 --> 03:29:39.740
Ross Valley has CASP data for two years,

03:29:39.740 --> 03:29:42.660
2017-18 and 2018-19, and as you know,

03:29:42.660 --> 03:29:45.140
we don't have 19-20 data.

03:29:45.140 --> 03:29:48.820
So we did analyze the 17-18 through 18-19 data

03:29:48.820 --> 03:29:51.860
and it does show that the Ross Valley Charter School

03:29:51.860 --> 03:29:53.900
does perform sufficiently by state metrics

03:29:53.900 --> 03:29:58.900
in accordance with Ed Code 47607.2B3A.

03:30:04.500 --> 03:30:06.900
We have a few charts here,

03:30:07.700 --> 03:30:10.180
we have a few charts here

03:30:10.180 --> 03:30:14.300
that will sort of highlight the CASP data

03:30:14.300 --> 03:30:17.540
for the two years that I just mentioned,

03:30:17.540 --> 03:30:20.100
17-18 and 18-19.

03:30:20.100 --> 03:30:23.700
As you can see, they have made growth in ELA

03:30:25.020 --> 03:30:29.380
amongst all students and amongst their subgroups.

03:30:35.180 --> 03:30:36.020
Next slide.

03:30:37.540 --> 03:30:39.500
Oh, it is the next slide, sorry.

03:30:39.500 --> 03:30:42.420
And then this is also the CASP data for mathematics.

03:30:42.420 --> 03:30:46.820
And again, have made growth for all students

03:30:46.820 --> 03:30:49.940
and growth amongst all subgroups.

03:30:54.900 --> 03:30:56.980
We added some of the dashboard data,

03:30:56.980 --> 03:30:58.820
I do believe it was in the item as well,

03:30:58.820 --> 03:31:02.260
but just so you can see it up here on the screen.

03:31:02.260 --> 03:31:06.660
For 2018, they didn't have data yet.

03:31:08.140 --> 03:31:11.780
And then 2019, they were in the blue

03:31:11.780 --> 03:31:14.420
for both ELA and mathematics.

03:31:18.700 --> 03:31:20.980
Here are the suspension rates

03:31:20.980 --> 03:31:23.780
and chronic absenteeism for the school.

03:31:24.620 --> 03:31:27.740
Both of those are in the yellow

03:31:27.740 --> 03:31:29.900
and I believe in the school obviously

03:31:29.900 --> 03:31:31.820
will be on the line shortly

03:31:32.340 --> 03:31:33.700
and can answer any questions about this.

03:31:33.700 --> 03:31:36.220
But from what I understand, the suspension rate

03:31:36.220 --> 03:31:39.220
for a small school, it was one student

03:31:39.220 --> 03:31:41.340
that was suspended twice.

03:31:41.340 --> 03:31:44.340
And I'm sure they can talk to you about that

03:31:44.340 --> 03:31:46.060
if you have questions about that.

03:31:49.260 --> 03:31:50.100
Next slide.

03:31:52.220 --> 03:31:54.420
So the Ross Valley Charter School

03:31:54.420 --> 03:31:58.500
has been under SBE authorization for the last five years

03:31:58.500 --> 03:32:02.860
and CDE oversight for almost five years.

03:32:02.860 --> 03:32:04.780
In that time, they have always been

03:32:04.780 --> 03:32:08.060
in positive physical health

03:32:08.060 --> 03:32:10.300
and they do show a positive ending fund balance

03:32:10.300 --> 03:32:13.220
moving forward and a strong reserve.

03:32:13.220 --> 03:32:14.300
It should be noted that

03:32:14.300 --> 03:32:16.500
because they are under CDE oversight,

03:32:16.500 --> 03:32:21.540
we have been working with the school

03:32:21.540 --> 03:32:24.660
as their oversight agency

03:32:24.820 --> 03:32:29.460
and are fairly familiar with the last four years

03:32:29.460 --> 03:32:33.580
of their fiscal livelihood.

03:32:38.420 --> 03:32:40.260
They do have, as you can see here,

03:32:40.260 --> 03:32:42.060
a very strong fundraising history.

03:32:42.060 --> 03:32:45.260
So the projected donations that they have put

03:32:45.260 --> 03:32:46.740
into their projected budgets

03:32:46.740 --> 03:32:49.180
seemed in line with past efforts

03:32:50.780 --> 03:32:52.620
and appeared reasonable to us.

03:32:53.620 --> 03:32:58.620
Here is a slide that shows the existing debt

03:32:59.420 --> 03:33:03.380
the school had as of March 10th, 2021.

03:33:03.380 --> 03:33:06.100
Obviously this has changed over the course

03:33:06.100 --> 03:33:07.700
of the last several months.

03:33:07.700 --> 03:33:11.060
We tend to get updates on their budget history,

03:33:11.060 --> 03:33:13.300
number one, because we're the authorizer.

03:33:13.300 --> 03:33:16.860
And number two, most charters that come up

03:33:16.860 --> 03:33:17.940
to the State Board on appeal,

03:33:17.940 --> 03:33:19.740
it takes months for them to actually

03:33:19.740 --> 03:33:21.620
get to the board hearing.

03:33:22.140 --> 03:33:27.020
And so any updating of their budgets

03:33:27.020 --> 03:33:31.860
is expected and allowable.

03:33:31.860 --> 03:33:36.860
And so here we show that what their current debt is

03:33:37.860 --> 03:33:39.020
as of March 10th.

03:33:43.780 --> 03:33:44.620
Next slide.

03:33:46.020 --> 03:33:50.940
Also, the school obtained a federal PPP loan,

03:33:50.940 --> 03:33:52.580
which has been forgiven.

03:33:52.580 --> 03:33:55.820
And we do have a bank letter that states

03:33:55.820 --> 03:33:58.260
in clear language that it was first.

03:34:01.700 --> 03:34:04.220
This is something, because the school's debt

03:34:04.220 --> 03:34:07.180
has been the focus for so many,

03:34:07.180 --> 03:34:09.860
the department wanted to do its due diligence

03:34:09.860 --> 03:34:11.420
and took the step of requesting

03:34:11.420 --> 03:34:13.780
an independent third party, FICMAT,

03:34:13.780 --> 03:34:16.460
which is the Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team,

03:34:16.460 --> 03:34:18.300
to review the debt load of the school

03:34:18.340 --> 03:34:21.340
and provide their analysis and some context around the debt.

03:34:21.340 --> 03:34:23.660
FICMAT has provided the superintendent and the board

03:34:23.660 --> 03:34:28.660
with a report, which I believe you all have in your files.

03:34:29.460 --> 03:34:34.460
They found that there are no reasons connected

03:34:34.740 --> 03:34:38.380
to the level or purpose of the debt to deny the charter.

03:34:38.380 --> 03:34:41.140
Our analysis concludes that the projected financial plan

03:34:41.140 --> 03:34:43.220
set forth by Ross Valley Charter School

03:34:43.220 --> 03:34:45.180
is fiscally sustainable.

03:34:45.180 --> 03:34:48.980
And I believe that FICMAT's Chief Executive Officer,

03:34:48.980 --> 03:34:51.980
Mike Fine, will be available on this call

03:34:51.980 --> 03:34:54.340
to answer any questions the board may have

03:34:54.340 --> 03:34:57.700
about the report that they completed.

03:35:03.860 --> 03:35:07.700
So the CPE finds that the petition does provide

03:35:07.700 --> 03:35:09.260
a reasonably comprehensive description

03:35:09.260 --> 03:35:11.140
of all the required elements

03:35:11.140 --> 03:35:13.860
and provides a strong education program.

03:35:13.860 --> 03:35:15.140
However, there are a couple of areas

03:35:15.140 --> 03:35:18.340
we would like to see in the petition strengthened.

03:35:18.340 --> 03:35:22.940
Those have to do with an area in element A,

03:35:22.940 --> 03:35:25.340
which is the description of the educational program,

03:35:25.340 --> 03:35:26.860
and an area in element J,

03:35:26.860 --> 03:35:29.500
which are suspension and expulsion procedures.

03:35:33.060 --> 03:35:36.220
So element A, we believe that

03:35:36.220 --> 03:35:39.180
the English Language Development Program

03:35:39.180 --> 03:35:41.900
should be amended to include more detail

03:35:41.940 --> 03:35:44.420
regarding the following.

03:35:46.100 --> 03:35:46.940
Next slide.

03:35:51.860 --> 03:35:54.260
So to state that the home language survey is completed

03:35:54.260 --> 03:35:56.900
when a student first enrolls in a California public school,

03:35:56.900 --> 03:35:59.420
state that the requirement for proficiency

03:35:59.420 --> 03:36:02.340
on the English Language Proficiency Assessment

03:36:02.340 --> 03:36:04.380
for California is a score of four,

03:36:04.380 --> 03:36:06.660
and include more detailed descriptions

03:36:06.660 --> 03:36:09.140
of the integrated and designated ELD instruction,

03:36:09.140 --> 03:36:11.340
as well as identify the integrated ELD

03:36:11.780 --> 03:36:12.860
and people monitoring these to occur

03:36:12.860 --> 03:36:14.540
across all subject matters.

03:36:16.060 --> 03:36:18.860
And then for the next slide,

03:36:18.860 --> 03:36:22.300
for the suspension and expulsion procedures,

03:36:22.300 --> 03:36:26.620
we just need them to add the following to their,

03:36:26.620 --> 03:36:31.620
add some clarification around Senate Bill 419.

03:36:31.620 --> 03:36:32.460
Next slide.

03:36:40.220 --> 03:36:42.780
And then also some clarification

03:36:42.780 --> 03:36:44.740
around the placement of a pupil

03:36:45.780 --> 03:36:48.340
when it comes to the manifestation determinations.

03:36:48.340 --> 03:36:51.140
So they have the correct language in their petition,

03:36:51.140 --> 03:36:52.620
but then they had another section

03:36:52.620 --> 03:36:54.180
that seemed to contradict it,

03:36:54.180 --> 03:36:57.180
so we just need to have them clarify that in their petition.

03:36:58.660 --> 03:37:00.740
And I believe those are the only two areas

03:37:00.740 --> 03:37:02.860
that we have found where we feel

03:37:02.860 --> 03:37:04.660
they need a little more clarification.

03:37:07.540 --> 03:37:08.860
Next slide.

03:37:08.860 --> 03:37:11.500
So in summary, the CDE staff recommends approval

03:37:11.500 --> 03:37:14.260
of the Ross Valley Charter School renewal petition

03:37:14.260 --> 03:37:16.780
with those two clarification conditions

03:37:16.780 --> 03:37:19.020
listed in prior slides.

03:37:19.020 --> 03:37:23.660
Also, if you'll remember, under AB 1505,

03:37:23.660 --> 03:37:27.660
when a state board approves a school on appeal,

03:37:27.660 --> 03:37:32.380
it must assign that school to either the local district

03:37:32.380 --> 03:37:35.380
or local county in which that school resides.

03:37:35.380 --> 03:37:40.380
So in alignment with Ed code,

03:37:40.820 --> 03:37:44.060
this Department of Ed staff consulted

03:37:44.060 --> 03:37:45.740
with the charter school,

03:37:45.740 --> 03:37:49.380
and they had requested that the school be assigned

03:37:49.380 --> 03:37:52.740
to the Marin County Board of Education for oversight.

03:37:53.940 --> 03:37:57.140
And then we will include as a condition of approval

03:37:57.620 --> 03:38:00.460
that the Ross Valley Charter School negotiate an MOU

03:38:00.460 --> 03:38:03.780
in good faith with the Marin County Office of Education.

03:38:04.660 --> 03:38:07.180
So this is a new step for us,

03:38:07.180 --> 03:38:10.700
and so we're working through this and working it out,

03:38:10.700 --> 03:38:14.020
and that's it.

03:38:14.020 --> 03:38:16.780
That's it for this item.

03:38:16.780 --> 03:38:18.900
So thank you, Stephanie.

03:38:18.900 --> 03:38:22.780
So now we're gonna go to a public hearing.

03:38:22.780 --> 03:38:26.420
I'm gonna open the public hearing at 1.16 p.m.

03:38:26.460 --> 03:38:28.660
First, we're gonna hear from the petitioners

03:38:28.660 --> 03:38:30.340
representing the charter school,

03:38:30.340 --> 03:38:32.060
and then we'll hear from the representatives

03:38:32.060 --> 03:38:33.540
from the school district,

03:38:33.540 --> 03:38:36.460
and each side will have 12 minutes.

03:38:36.460 --> 03:38:40.460
So charter school representatives, you may begin now.

03:38:41.300 --> 03:38:43.940
So let's see where you are,

03:38:43.940 --> 03:38:47.180
and let's get your slides shared.

03:38:49.460 --> 03:38:52.620
So we will hear from the Ross Valley Charter Petitioners.

03:38:56.420 --> 03:39:01.260
Thank you.

03:39:01.260 --> 03:39:02.500
Good afternoon.

03:39:02.500 --> 03:39:03.620
My name is Luke Duchesne.

03:39:03.620 --> 03:39:05.860
I'm the school director for Ross Valley Charter

03:39:05.860 --> 03:39:08.900
and have been so for the past four years.

03:39:08.900 --> 03:39:11.820
I want to thank you and your staff

03:39:11.820 --> 03:39:14.740
for taking the time to consider this renewal appeal.

03:39:14.740 --> 03:39:16.780
I also want to thank the CBE staff

03:39:16.780 --> 03:39:18.500
for their positive recommendation,

03:39:18.500 --> 03:39:21.660
the ACCS for their positive recommendation,

03:39:21.660 --> 03:39:23.940
and FICMAT for their extra analysis

03:39:23.940 --> 03:39:26.340
of our financial standing prior to this meeting.

03:39:27.700 --> 03:39:30.380
I'm gonna start by providing a brief background.

03:39:31.860 --> 03:39:36.180
Five years ago, we came before the state board on appeal

03:39:36.180 --> 03:39:40.220
and promoted our three main goals.

03:39:40.220 --> 03:39:42.460
One, that we'd meet longstanding parent demand

03:39:42.460 --> 03:39:45.260
for choice in the Ross Valley.

03:39:45.260 --> 03:39:46.500
We'd be more diverse

03:39:46.500 --> 03:39:48.740
than the Ross Valley Elementary District.

03:39:48.740 --> 03:39:51.100
We deepen our culture of collaborative self-governance

03:39:51.100 --> 03:39:53.500
that empowers teachers, parents, and students.

03:39:53.500 --> 03:39:55.900
I'm proud to say that we've accomplished

03:39:55.900 --> 03:39:57.140
all three of these goals.

03:39:58.500 --> 03:40:00.820
We have expanded enrollment

03:40:00.820 --> 03:40:02.620
and plan to be at capacity in the fall.

03:40:03.940 --> 03:40:06.180
We have attracted a diverse student body

03:40:07.100 --> 03:40:09.300
and have created an inclusive, collaborative,

03:40:09.300 --> 03:40:13.380
and engaged community of staff, parents, and learners.

03:40:15.100 --> 03:40:18.420
I'm now going to introduce one of our fabulous

03:40:18.420 --> 03:40:21.020
multi-age teachers, Emily Bello,

03:40:21.020 --> 03:40:23.020
who will discuss our educational program.

03:40:24.500 --> 03:40:25.580
Thank you, Luke.

03:40:25.580 --> 03:40:27.420
Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond

03:40:27.420 --> 03:40:29.500
and the members of the state board.

03:40:29.500 --> 03:40:31.180
My name is Emily Bello-Corell,

03:40:31.180 --> 03:40:33.900
and I'd like to highlight some of the important features

03:40:33.900 --> 03:40:36.020
of our educational program.

03:40:36.020 --> 03:40:38.020
First being our student-centered,

03:40:38.020 --> 03:40:41.620
curiosity-driven, inquiry-based curriculum

03:40:41.620 --> 03:40:44.500
that actively engages all of our students,

03:40:44.500 --> 03:40:49.300
grade K through five, in deep, symptomatic inquiry units

03:40:49.300 --> 03:40:52.420
where their questions are encouraged and expected.

03:40:52.420 --> 03:40:54.420
Teachers help to guide the students

03:40:54.420 --> 03:40:57.180
in their research process to uncover answers

03:40:57.180 --> 03:41:00.340
to their questions in an authentic way,

03:41:00.340 --> 03:41:04.660
where student choice and collaboration is highly valued.

03:41:04.660 --> 03:41:07.580
I'd also like to highlight our multi-age classrooms.

03:41:08.460 --> 03:41:11.900
Students spend two years at a time with the teacher.

03:41:11.900 --> 03:41:14.220
They cycle through being the younger student

03:41:14.220 --> 03:41:15.940
and the older student in the classroom,

03:41:15.940 --> 03:41:18.300
so mentee, mentor.

03:41:18.300 --> 03:41:22.100
And this leads to a deep knowledge of student needs

03:41:22.100 --> 03:41:24.220
on the part of the teacher.

03:41:24.220 --> 03:41:28.220
It creates a rich, connected, joyful community

03:41:28.220 --> 03:41:31.780
where students are known and families are known,

03:41:31.780 --> 03:41:36.340
and it creates a very comfortable type community.

03:41:38.020 --> 03:41:39.060
Next page, please.

03:41:41.620 --> 03:41:44.540
We have a varied and experienced staff

03:41:44.540 --> 03:41:46.740
to meet the needs of our students,

03:41:46.740 --> 03:41:50.340
including an EL, an intervention teacher,

03:41:50.380 --> 03:41:52.420
a family outreach coordinator.

03:41:52.420 --> 03:41:55.860
We also have a community council of parents and teachers

03:41:55.860 --> 03:41:59.780
who help make decisions on a day-to-day basis.

03:41:59.780 --> 03:42:02.500
And we have nine classroom teachers

03:42:02.500 --> 03:42:03.980
that are highly experienced,

03:42:03.980 --> 03:42:08.980
and an additional number of teachers in our support staff.

03:42:11.300 --> 03:42:12.140
Next page.

03:42:13.740 --> 03:42:17.340
We're proud to be a more diverse school in Marin County,

03:42:17.340 --> 03:42:18.940
and this chart demonstrates

03:42:18.940 --> 03:42:21.700
that our school population aligns more closely

03:42:21.700 --> 03:42:23.340
with Marin's population,

03:42:23.340 --> 03:42:25.460
which has been an important goal for us.

03:42:25.460 --> 03:42:27.100
I'd just like to point out

03:42:27.100 --> 03:42:31.540
that our Hispanic or Latino population is 27.8%,

03:42:31.540 --> 03:42:35.420
our white population, 53.6%,

03:42:35.420 --> 03:42:39.300
and 20% of our students are English learners.

03:42:40.500 --> 03:42:41.340
Next page.

03:42:42.900 --> 03:42:43.940
All right.

03:42:43.940 --> 03:42:46.820
We're also happy to be a continually growing school

03:42:46.820 --> 03:42:50.620
as more families choose RVC each year.

03:42:50.620 --> 03:42:53.580
Presently, we're close to our maximum capacity.

03:42:53.580 --> 03:42:57.580
We have 90 new applicants for the 21, 22 school year.

03:42:59.340 --> 03:43:01.260
Over 20% of our students are eligible

03:43:01.260 --> 03:43:03.100
for free and reduced price lunch,

03:43:03.100 --> 03:43:05.700
which is three times the district's percentage.

03:43:05.700 --> 03:43:08.100
Our English learner percentage is 20%,

03:43:08.100 --> 03:43:10.580
which is five times the district's percentage.

03:43:11.500 --> 03:43:15.140
We have a high retention and satisfaction rate.

03:43:15.140 --> 03:43:17.660
We've worked hard to cultivate a warm

03:43:17.660 --> 03:43:20.020
and welcoming community for all families

03:43:20.020 --> 03:43:22.260
that values and promotes diversity,

03:43:22.260 --> 03:43:25.260
and we actively incorporate diverse perspectives

03:43:25.260 --> 03:43:27.180
into our school culture.

03:43:27.180 --> 03:43:28.020
Thank you.

03:43:30.180 --> 03:43:31.220
Thank you, Emily.

03:43:31.220 --> 03:43:34.380
And as she just described our program,

03:43:34.380 --> 03:43:35.860
we have seen great results

03:43:35.860 --> 03:43:38.580
as borne out by the state test scores.

03:43:38.580 --> 03:43:41.460
With our English language arts scores,

03:43:41.460 --> 03:43:44.580
having 82.98% of our students meeting

03:43:44.580 --> 03:43:45.820
or exceeding standard.

03:43:47.580 --> 03:43:51.380
For math, 73.4% of our students meet

03:43:51.380 --> 03:43:53.140
or exceed standard.

03:43:54.660 --> 03:43:58.700
For science, 78.05% meet or exceed standard.

03:44:00.140 --> 03:44:02.820
And then really looking at the year over year growth

03:44:02.820 --> 03:44:04.780
from our two years of test scores,

03:44:04.780 --> 03:44:07.940
you can see that overall for school-wide growth,

03:44:07.940 --> 03:44:10.460
we grew in both ELA and math.

03:44:11.300 --> 03:44:14.620
And then our white students,

03:44:14.620 --> 03:44:17.740
and then our other subgroups grew substantially

03:44:18.740 --> 03:44:21.500
year over year in ELA and math.

03:44:21.500 --> 03:44:23.740
It's our Hispanic and Latino student growth,

03:44:25.140 --> 03:44:27.740
our economically just advanced student growth,

03:44:29.460 --> 03:44:31.420
and our English learner student growth.

03:44:32.780 --> 03:44:35.620
And digging in further on our English learner student growth,

03:44:35.620 --> 03:44:38.420
just kind of seeing where the kids came

03:44:38.420 --> 03:44:40.540
when we first had them our first year,

03:44:40.540 --> 03:44:45.060
and then their progress on the LPAC the year after

03:44:45.060 --> 03:44:47.140
as measured by the California dashboard,

03:44:47.140 --> 03:44:49.780
you'll see that we attained a high progress level

03:44:50.980 --> 03:44:52.500
as compared to the state

03:44:52.500 --> 03:44:55.060
and the closest comparison school in the district.

03:44:59.020 --> 03:45:01.740
And then in March 13th when we found out

03:45:01.740 --> 03:45:03.780
that we had to pivot quickly

03:45:04.820 --> 03:45:06.340
to address the needs of our kids

03:45:06.340 --> 03:45:07.980
when schools closed down in Marin,

03:45:08.860 --> 03:45:11.060
we worked with our county health office

03:45:11.060 --> 03:45:15.900
to quickly reopen in distance learning.

03:45:15.900 --> 03:45:18.540
And we did that the first day after.

03:45:18.540 --> 03:45:22.180
And we've had a hybrid model this school year

03:45:22.180 --> 03:45:25.700
moving to in-person instruction in November.

03:45:25.700 --> 03:45:29.780
And we are moving to full-time in-person instruction

03:45:29.780 --> 03:45:31.500
after spring break.

03:45:31.500 --> 03:45:33.180
And we thought it was really important to focus

03:45:33.180 --> 03:45:34.540
on the social emotional wellbeing

03:45:34.540 --> 03:45:35.860
of our students during this time

03:45:35.860 --> 03:45:39.100
and ensure that we're continuing to provide support

03:45:39.100 --> 03:45:41.860
for English learners and our special education students

03:45:41.860 --> 03:45:44.540
with services for the duration,

03:45:44.540 --> 03:45:46.260
including during the summer,

03:45:47.940 --> 03:45:50.540
incorporating all of our key elements of who we are.

03:45:54.460 --> 03:45:55.380
I'm going to pass it over

03:45:55.380 --> 03:45:57.100
to our board chair, Sharon Sagar.

03:45:58.580 --> 03:45:59.700
Thank you.

03:45:59.700 --> 03:46:01.860
So we're really pleased to have moved

03:46:01.860 --> 03:46:04.220
to our own site two years ago

03:46:04.220 --> 03:46:05.940
with a long-term lease,

03:46:05.940 --> 03:46:08.700
which helped to remove much of the community conflict

03:46:08.700 --> 03:46:12.060
over having our school housed on a shared campus.

03:46:12.060 --> 03:46:14.780
We've made several upgrades to our new facility

03:46:14.780 --> 03:46:17.060
this past fall that have enabled us

03:46:17.060 --> 03:46:18.700
to better serve our students,

03:46:18.700 --> 03:46:23.580
including upgrades to our path of travel,

03:46:23.580 --> 03:46:26.620
accessibility and fire, life and safety systems.

03:46:27.900 --> 03:46:32.460
We're grateful to our excellent charter oversight officers

03:46:32.460 --> 03:46:34.900
that we've worked with during our first five years,

03:46:34.900 --> 03:46:37.620
Chad Owes and Matt Huggleston,

03:46:37.620 --> 03:46:39.300
and they've supported us in our efforts,

03:46:39.300 --> 03:46:40.980
as well as helping us to continue

03:46:40.980 --> 03:46:44.220
to improve our systems and practices.

03:46:44.220 --> 03:46:46.460
We've also developed working relationships

03:46:46.460 --> 03:46:47.980
with other school districts

03:46:49.100 --> 03:46:51.260
and have developed a good working relationship

03:46:51.260 --> 03:46:53.580
with the Marin County Office of Education.

03:46:54.500 --> 03:46:58.860
Recently, we were invited to present a workshop

03:46:58.860 --> 03:47:01.380
to other school districts about our diversity

03:47:01.380 --> 03:47:06.060
and inclusion committee's interactive newsletters.

03:47:06.060 --> 03:47:08.540
So our diversity inclusion committee

03:47:08.540 --> 03:47:10.580
presented to other districts,

03:47:10.580 --> 03:47:12.140
and those newsletters were shared

03:47:12.140 --> 03:47:14.140
to many other districts in the county.

03:47:18.100 --> 03:47:20.940
We've also shared with our parents

03:47:20.940 --> 03:47:25.180
and helped to build a more inclusive community.

03:47:25.180 --> 03:47:27.420
We're grateful for the positive recommendations

03:47:27.420 --> 03:47:28.980
for our renewal, and we accept

03:47:28.980 --> 03:47:30.860
all of the revision recommendations

03:47:30.860 --> 03:47:31.980
that have been given.

03:47:32.980 --> 03:47:35.180
We always continue to follow cycles

03:47:35.180 --> 03:47:36.660
of continuous improvement,

03:47:36.660 --> 03:47:39.300
and we're addressing any areas that kept us

03:47:39.300 --> 03:47:41.580
from meeting the high achieving designation.

03:47:42.620 --> 03:47:44.700
Our staff is always working to better meet the needs

03:47:44.700 --> 03:47:46.220
of our students and families.

03:47:47.620 --> 03:47:49.540
We look forward to answering any questions

03:47:49.540 --> 03:47:51.380
you have and hearing any feedback,

03:47:51.380 --> 03:47:53.580
and we thank you so much for your time today.

03:47:54.500 --> 03:47:59.500
Does that conclude the Ross Valley presentation?

03:48:04.420 --> 03:48:05.700
Yes, thank you, Member Strauss.

03:48:05.700 --> 03:48:07.180
Yes, that concludes our presentation.

03:48:07.180 --> 03:48:10.380
Okay, so now we're going to hear from the school district,

03:48:10.380 --> 03:48:14.020
and the school district will now have 12 minutes.

03:48:23.580 --> 03:48:26.580
I'll turn my screen sharing on just a minute here.

03:48:32.700 --> 03:48:34.860
All right, can everybody see the presentation

03:48:34.860 --> 03:48:35.700
up on the screen?

03:48:37.420 --> 03:48:42.420
So it's in presenter view, so we can't...

03:48:43.460 --> 03:48:44.300
Hold on a second.

03:48:44.300 --> 03:48:45.140
Okay.

03:48:45.140 --> 03:48:45.980
Okay.

03:48:45.980 --> 03:48:46.820
Okay.

03:48:46.820 --> 03:48:47.660
Okay.

03:48:47.660 --> 03:48:48.500
Okay.

03:48:48.500 --> 03:48:49.340
Okay.

03:48:49.340 --> 03:48:50.180
Okay.

03:48:50.180 --> 03:48:51.020
Okay.

03:48:51.020 --> 03:48:51.860
Okay.

03:48:52.300 --> 03:48:54.140
Hold on.

03:48:54.140 --> 03:48:54.980
Let me see if I can...

03:48:54.980 --> 03:48:57.020
I haven't started your 12 minutes yet, so.

03:48:58.220 --> 03:49:01.900
Let me go ahead and see if I can get this up.

03:49:03.340 --> 03:49:04.220
How's that?

03:49:04.220 --> 03:49:05.140
Still presenter view?

03:49:06.100 --> 03:49:07.500
We can't see it.

03:49:07.500 --> 03:49:08.580
Okay, just a minute.

03:49:12.860 --> 03:49:13.700
Share screen.

03:49:22.860 --> 03:49:24.460
Let me see if this one works.

03:49:24.460 --> 03:49:25.300
Just a minute.

03:49:27.180 --> 03:49:28.780
And...

03:49:28.780 --> 03:49:29.620
That's better.

03:49:29.620 --> 03:49:31.220
There, how about that?

03:49:31.220 --> 03:49:34.380
No, actually, you might go back to the other view

03:49:34.380 --> 03:49:37.700
because we could see the screen a little better, yeah.

03:49:37.700 --> 03:49:39.140
Can you see the screen now?

03:49:40.900 --> 03:49:43.540
Yeah, so that's better.

03:49:43.540 --> 03:49:44.580
Right now is good.

03:49:45.500 --> 03:49:47.380
Okay, we'll start your 12 minutes now.

03:49:47.380 --> 03:49:48.300
Can you hold on one second?

03:49:48.300 --> 03:49:49.820
Are you seeing it in presenter mode,

03:49:49.820 --> 03:49:54.500
or just in just the regular PowerPoint mode?

03:49:54.500 --> 03:49:56.580
No, we can see this full slide now.

03:49:56.580 --> 03:49:58.540
But it's just in regular PowerPoint mode,

03:49:58.540 --> 03:50:00.340
not in presenter mode at the moment.

03:50:00.340 --> 03:50:02.220
Okay, hold on a second.

03:50:02.220 --> 03:50:03.340
Just let me get this.

03:50:05.620 --> 03:50:06.460
How about that?

03:50:08.340 --> 03:50:09.180
It didn't make a change.

03:50:09.180 --> 03:50:10.020
Hold on.

03:50:12.140 --> 03:50:12.980
Sorry about that.

03:50:12.980 --> 03:50:13.820
Just a minute.

03:50:13.820 --> 03:50:14.660
Okay.

03:50:18.660 --> 03:50:20.780
The technical challenges of remote.

03:50:22.740 --> 03:50:23.980
Actually, hold on a second.

03:50:23.980 --> 03:50:24.820
Let me...

03:50:25.860 --> 03:50:27.260
It was working earlier.

03:50:27.260 --> 03:50:29.820
Let me get back to share screen here.

03:50:29.820 --> 03:50:30.660
Hold on.

03:50:30.660 --> 03:50:32.820
Let me know if you want me to try, Shelley.

03:50:32.820 --> 03:50:33.660
Okay.

03:50:37.700 --> 03:50:39.180
One more time here.

03:50:40.180 --> 03:50:45.020
And you need to uncheck the presenter view.

03:50:45.020 --> 03:50:49.300
Yeah, like, let me look and see here.

03:50:49.300 --> 03:50:51.340
Okay, I'm taking it off that.

03:50:51.340 --> 03:50:54.140
And how about that?

03:50:55.220 --> 03:50:56.700
It's showing.

03:50:56.700 --> 03:50:58.500
Is it showing your presenter view,

03:50:58.500 --> 03:51:00.940
or just on the screen?

03:51:03.020 --> 03:51:04.460
It looks like your screen.

03:51:05.380 --> 03:51:06.220
Okay.

03:51:06.220 --> 03:51:08.060
Hit from beginning now and see.

03:51:10.060 --> 03:51:10.900
Resume slideshow.

03:51:10.900 --> 03:51:12.540
Let's see what that looks like.

03:51:12.540 --> 03:51:13.380
How about that?

03:51:13.380 --> 03:51:14.220
Still?

03:51:15.900 --> 03:51:17.140
Still...

03:51:17.140 --> 03:51:18.140
We need to...

03:51:18.140 --> 03:51:18.980
Okay.

03:51:18.980 --> 03:51:20.180
All right, well...

03:51:20.180 --> 03:51:21.020
I think you're okay.

03:51:21.020 --> 03:51:22.100
We can see it.

03:51:22.100 --> 03:51:22.940
Do you...

03:51:22.940 --> 03:51:25.140
The question is moving to the next slides,

03:51:25.140 --> 03:51:25.980
but we'll...

03:51:27.180 --> 03:51:28.100
There we go.

03:51:28.100 --> 03:51:29.020
Okay.

03:51:29.020 --> 03:51:29.860
Okay.

03:51:29.860 --> 03:51:30.700
All right.

03:51:30.700 --> 03:51:31.540
We may begin.

03:51:33.380 --> 03:51:34.220
Okay.

03:51:34.220 --> 03:51:35.060
Hello.

03:51:35.060 --> 03:51:37.020
I'm Superintendent Marcie Trahan.

03:51:37.020 --> 03:51:38.740
I'd like to thank you for considering

03:51:39.300 --> 03:51:41.620
the comprehensive analysis we've provided

03:51:41.620 --> 03:51:43.940
as you make this very important decision.

03:51:50.140 --> 03:51:51.460
No, hold on a second.

03:51:56.860 --> 03:51:58.100
Unlike charter schools,

03:51:58.100 --> 03:52:00.300
our student demographics are limited

03:52:00.300 --> 03:52:02.020
by our district boundaries.

03:52:02.020 --> 03:52:05.500
Comparing RVC to the district creates a misperception

03:52:05.500 --> 03:52:08.260
that certain students are leaving

03:52:08.780 --> 03:52:10.380
a district to attend RVC.

03:52:10.380 --> 03:52:13.300
This is not the case, as you can see from this slide.

03:52:13.300 --> 03:52:15.940
Unfortunately, neither CDE nor RVC

03:52:15.940 --> 03:52:19.740
have provided the detailed enrollment data we've requested.

03:52:19.740 --> 03:52:22.460
We welcome all students from all over the region

03:52:22.460 --> 03:52:26.100
and embrace all families who want to come to our schools.

03:52:26.100 --> 03:52:27.220
Now I'd like to hand it over

03:52:27.220 --> 03:52:30.220
to our board president, Shelly Hamilton.

03:52:30.220 --> 03:52:31.060
Thank you.

03:52:33.780 --> 03:52:34.940
Hi.

03:52:34.940 --> 03:52:36.300
Recently, a few people have asked me

03:52:36.300 --> 03:52:38.940
why I care about this particular issue,

03:52:38.940 --> 03:52:40.940
and it's actually a pretty simple answer.

03:52:40.940 --> 03:52:42.500
It's because of the kids.

03:52:42.500 --> 03:52:44.580
At the end of the day, the reason for our denial

03:52:44.580 --> 03:52:47.580
is about what's best for kids, all kids.

03:52:47.580 --> 03:52:49.740
Now, more than ever, they need a future

03:52:49.740 --> 03:52:52.540
that they can count on and equitable outcomes

03:52:52.540 --> 03:52:54.260
that support all learners.

03:52:54.260 --> 03:52:55.980
Students going on to middle school,

03:52:55.980 --> 03:52:57.420
academically unprepared,

03:52:57.420 --> 03:52:59.300
and thousands of families across the state

03:52:59.300 --> 03:53:00.700
whose lives have been disrupted

03:53:00.700 --> 03:53:02.460
when their schools ran out of money

03:53:02.460 --> 03:53:04.580
and abruptly closed their doors,

03:53:04.580 --> 03:53:06.180
and many more in districts

03:53:06.180 --> 03:53:08.420
that have had to suddenly adjust their classrooms

03:53:08.420 --> 03:53:10.820
and budgets to welcome those kids back.

03:53:10.820 --> 03:53:12.620
It's just not good for the kids,

03:53:12.620 --> 03:53:14.580
and we shouldn't be playing high stakes monopoly

03:53:14.580 --> 03:53:16.220
with our children's future.

03:53:16.220 --> 03:53:20.380
And that's exactly why this new AB 1505 review process exists,

03:53:20.380 --> 03:53:22.540
to proactively do what's best

03:53:22.540 --> 03:53:24.900
for both charter and district families,

03:53:24.900 --> 03:53:27.700
rather than have to reactively pick up the pieces

03:53:27.700 --> 03:53:30.460
after the fact or make up for educational gaps

03:53:30.460 --> 03:53:31.300
down the line.

03:53:32.140 --> 03:53:34.100
As stewards of a greater good,

03:53:34.100 --> 03:53:36.660
you are publicly entrusted to make this decision

03:53:36.660 --> 03:53:38.820
for the educational future of our children,

03:53:38.820 --> 03:53:41.820
not just on behalf of the families that attend any one school

03:53:41.820 --> 03:53:43.540
or in any one district like ours,

03:53:43.540 --> 03:53:47.540
but on behalf of all 6.1 million students in our state.

03:53:47.540 --> 03:53:50.340
Today, you will make a precedent setting decision

03:53:50.340 --> 03:53:52.380
under AB 1505.

03:53:52.380 --> 03:53:55.100
Today, you will consider how the legislative intent

03:53:55.100 --> 03:53:57.780
of accountability is to be interpreted.

03:53:57.780 --> 03:54:00.100
You will decide how high of a bar you are

03:54:00.140 --> 03:54:03.500
and how high of a bar you want to set in overturning

03:54:04.740 --> 03:54:06.780
or in honoring the decisions

03:54:06.780 --> 03:54:09.780
of locally elected school boards, like the one I sit on.

03:54:09.780 --> 03:54:12.980
And having been thrust into this precedent setting spotlight

03:54:12.980 --> 03:54:16.140
here in Marin, we feel the responsibility to be allies

03:54:16.140 --> 03:54:18.220
with our school board colleagues across the state,

03:54:18.220 --> 03:54:20.580
from LA Unified up the Central Valley

03:54:20.580 --> 03:54:22.540
and on over to the East Bay.

03:54:22.540 --> 03:54:24.140
And instead of speaking for them,

03:54:24.140 --> 03:54:26.380
we've dedicated some time for you to hear directly

03:54:26.380 --> 03:54:28.420
from them, from Mike Hutchison,

03:54:28.420 --> 03:54:31.140
a trustee at Oakland Unified School District.

03:54:31.140 --> 03:54:31.980
Mike?

03:54:37.700 --> 03:54:38.700
Mike, are you there?

03:54:39.740 --> 03:54:40.700
Yes, thank you.

03:54:40.700 --> 03:54:44.900
Sorry, it's a quick small technical difficulty there.

03:54:44.900 --> 03:54:47.340
So, hi, my name is Mike Hutchison

03:54:47.340 --> 03:54:50.940
and I'm a school board director here in Oakland, California.

03:54:50.940 --> 03:54:53.460
And I'm very happy today to be here to support our neighbors

03:54:53.460 --> 03:54:56.300
across the Bay and Ross Valley.

03:54:56.300 --> 03:54:58.980
The intent of Assembly Bill 1505

03:54:58.980 --> 03:55:02.100
was really to strengthen local control

03:55:02.100 --> 03:55:06.260
over decisions of granting charters and charter renewals.

03:55:06.260 --> 03:55:09.140
And your decision today is going to have implications

03:55:09.140 --> 03:55:11.820
for a lot of us across the state.

03:55:11.820 --> 03:55:14.420
In Oakland, we have the highest rate of charter schools

03:55:14.420 --> 03:55:16.380
in the state of California.

03:55:16.380 --> 03:55:19.500
Many of those came when we were taken over by the state

03:55:19.500 --> 03:55:22.700
and they were imposed on us by a state administrator.

03:55:22.700 --> 03:55:25.620
Since then, the number of charter schools in Oakland

03:55:25.620 --> 03:55:26.980
has only grown.

03:55:26.980 --> 03:55:29.900
Where today we have roughly one third of our schools

03:55:29.900 --> 03:55:31.380
are charter schools.

03:55:31.380 --> 03:55:33.860
And of those 43 charter schools,

03:55:33.860 --> 03:55:36.020
seven were approved by the county

03:55:36.020 --> 03:55:38.180
and one was approved by the state,

03:55:38.180 --> 03:55:41.100
effectively disenfranchising our community

03:55:41.100 --> 03:55:44.060
and taking away our ability to control

03:55:44.060 --> 03:55:46.900
who we pay to educate our students.

03:55:46.900 --> 03:55:49.180
I'm really encouraging you today

03:55:49.180 --> 03:55:51.740
to stand up with our statewide network

03:55:51.740 --> 03:55:54.220
that fought to get this bill passed

03:55:54.220 --> 03:55:59.220
and to back local decision-makers in these decisions.

03:55:59.500 --> 03:56:02.500
It's very important for all of us going forward

03:56:02.500 --> 03:56:05.140
and I cannot stress enough

03:56:05.140 --> 03:56:07.940
that I'll probably be in Sacramento soon myself

03:56:07.940 --> 03:56:10.940
defending our school district against

03:56:10.940 --> 03:56:15.940
the charter renewal or application

03:56:17.580 --> 03:56:19.620
of this charter school.

03:56:19.620 --> 03:56:22.220
Please defend our local democratically elected

03:56:22.220 --> 03:56:23.660
decision-makers, thank you.

03:56:25.180 --> 03:56:28.740
Thanks Mike, we really appreciate you being with us today.

03:56:28.740 --> 03:56:30.860
Thank you so much, sorry for that technical difficulty.

03:56:30.860 --> 03:56:34.460
So now you'll are gonna hear from a local community member

03:56:34.460 --> 03:56:37.180
who also just happens to be a national expert

03:56:37.180 --> 03:56:38.820
on public finance.

03:56:38.820 --> 03:56:40.340
Patrick, are you there?

03:56:40.340 --> 03:56:41.700
Yes, I'm here, thanks.

03:56:42.740 --> 03:56:46.060
Good afternoon to the board and thank you.

03:56:46.060 --> 03:56:47.980
As was mentioned, my name is Patrick Murphy

03:56:47.980 --> 03:56:49.980
and I live in the Ross Valley community.

03:56:49.980 --> 03:56:52.620
I also have about three decades of experience

03:56:52.620 --> 03:56:54.820
on public finance issues.

03:56:54.820 --> 03:56:56.500
And I guess in the current environment,

03:56:56.500 --> 03:56:58.660
I feel the need to state that I don't consider myself

03:56:58.660 --> 03:57:02.060
anti-charter and in fact, I think just about anyone

03:57:02.060 --> 03:57:04.340
who would look at my resume would pretty much decide

03:57:04.340 --> 03:57:05.540
almost the opposite.

03:57:07.100 --> 03:57:10.780
Saying that though, I am here to say that my review

03:57:10.780 --> 03:57:13.220
suggests that Ross Valley Charter

03:57:13.220 --> 03:57:16.460
is not a fiscally sustainable entity.

03:57:16.460 --> 03:57:19.020
I come to that conclusion after reviewing the materials

03:57:19.020 --> 03:57:21.660
that were presented as part of this appeal

03:57:21.660 --> 03:57:23.980
but actually went back to look at the documents

03:57:23.980 --> 03:57:26.180
that were publicly made available

03:57:26.180 --> 03:57:28.020
in conjunction with board meetings,

03:57:28.020 --> 03:57:33.020
going back each month to the 2017, 2018 school year.

03:57:34.380 --> 03:57:37.420
From that review, the thing that stuck out the most

03:57:37.420 --> 03:57:42.220
was the fact that RBC has been relying very much

03:57:42.220 --> 03:57:44.860
on either one time money or borrowing

03:57:44.860 --> 03:57:48.180
to meet their regular expenses,

03:57:48.180 --> 03:57:49.700
make ends meet if you will.

03:57:50.060 --> 03:57:55.060
I liken this to the individual who essentially lives

03:57:55.900 --> 03:57:59.300
from credit card to credit card paying for daily expenses

03:58:00.300 --> 03:58:02.140
and that gets them to the end of the month.

03:58:02.140 --> 03:58:05.740
At any one time, the picture might be okay

03:58:05.740 --> 03:58:08.060
but overall, it usually ends badly.

03:58:08.060 --> 03:58:11.300
And for a public school, this is not a great idea.

03:58:12.580 --> 03:58:14.220
If we go to the next slide,

03:58:15.380 --> 03:58:19.100
you've heard up to now that the financial picture

03:58:19.180 --> 03:58:24.060
at least as determined by staff is okay for RBC.

03:58:24.060 --> 03:58:26.340
I obviously disagree with that

03:58:26.340 --> 03:58:29.700
and I think part of the disagreement comes from the fact

03:58:29.700 --> 03:58:34.180
that the reviews have been done based on a curated set

03:58:34.180 --> 03:58:37.420
of snapshots of the financial picture of RBC

03:58:37.420 --> 03:58:40.580
and doesn't have the complete picture.

03:58:40.580 --> 03:58:42.900
I don't think there's been the context or history

03:58:42.900 --> 03:58:46.620
to make an evaluation of that experience

03:58:46.620 --> 03:58:49.180
and perhaps more importantly,

03:58:49.180 --> 03:58:52.820
there aren't regulations to accompany AB 1505 yet

03:58:52.820 --> 03:58:55.300
in terms of what the standard is.

03:58:55.300 --> 03:58:58.660
For example, we had in the FICMAT letter using

03:58:58.660 --> 03:59:02.460
or at least referencing a private entity standard

03:59:02.460 --> 03:59:04.580
to make a determination, which again,

03:59:04.580 --> 03:59:07.580
doesn't strike me as a great way to make this assessment.

03:59:08.540 --> 03:59:10.900
Perhaps my biggest concern, however,

03:59:10.900 --> 03:59:13.420
comes from the documents themselves.

03:59:13.420 --> 03:59:16.300
Those that were publicly available that I reviewed

03:59:17.180 --> 03:59:20.220
have been at best problematic and opaque.

03:59:20.220 --> 03:59:24.380
They were inconsistent in both their content, their timing.

03:59:24.380 --> 03:59:26.540
There's no way to reconcile numbers

03:59:27.580 --> 03:59:30.980
and in fact, at one point there was a very odd situation

03:59:30.980 --> 03:59:34.580
where RBC had submitted to the CDE

03:59:34.580 --> 03:59:37.260
for two different purposes, one for this appeal

03:59:37.260 --> 03:59:39.540
and another to try to get deferrals,

03:59:39.540 --> 03:59:42.700
be exempt from deferrals, which had cash flows,

03:59:42.700 --> 03:59:45.340
which said different things

03:59:46.380 --> 03:59:48.540
for obviously different purposes,

03:59:48.540 --> 03:59:51.140
but again, quite troubling.

03:59:51.140 --> 03:59:54.500
So from where I sit, I don't see RBC

03:59:54.500 --> 03:59:56.460
as a sustainable entity.

03:59:56.460 --> 04:00:00.700
I would respectfully suggest that you haven't been provided

04:00:00.700 --> 04:00:03.980
with a complete assessment of its fiscal health.

04:00:03.980 --> 04:00:07.140
I would note that the FICMAT letter itself

04:00:07.140 --> 04:00:10.860
is simply a snapshot of one point in time.

04:00:10.860 --> 04:00:13.460
And so absent those things and absent a standard

04:00:13.460 --> 04:00:15.700
at which you can compare them,

04:00:15.700 --> 04:00:18.020
I would respectfully suggest that you don't approve

04:00:18.020 --> 04:00:22.340
this appeal, particularly for the precedent it'll set.

04:00:22.340 --> 04:00:23.180
Thank you.

04:00:25.860 --> 04:00:29.820
So similarly opaque is the academic performance analysis

04:00:29.820 --> 04:00:32.700
that you were provided by RBC and CDE.

04:00:32.700 --> 04:00:34.780
The numbers in the table that you see here on the left

04:00:34.780 --> 04:00:37.460
were taken directly from the CDE report.

04:00:37.460 --> 04:00:39.980
However, the CDE analysis does not represent

04:00:39.980 --> 04:00:44.980
what was intended under section 47607.2B1.

04:00:45.380 --> 04:00:47.860
This section in fact makes no mention of improvement

04:00:47.860 --> 04:00:51.540
and instead it focuses on comparative annual performance.

04:00:51.540 --> 04:00:54.140
All the green areas that you see on the tables

04:00:54.140 --> 04:00:57.220
show that when you break down the data into the subgroups,

04:00:57.220 --> 04:01:01.220
RBC underperforms the district at least 80% of the time

04:01:01.220 --> 04:01:02.500
for both years.

04:01:02.500 --> 04:01:04.300
And on the right side is an example

04:01:04.300 --> 04:01:06.700
of the equity gap charts that we've provided to you.

04:01:06.700 --> 04:01:09.100
Again, from a comparative analysis,

04:01:09.100 --> 04:01:12.220
RBC's equity gaps are much larger than the districts,

04:01:12.220 --> 04:01:16.860
100% of the time for both ELA and math and for both years.

04:01:16.860 --> 04:01:20.140
And that's even with their second year improvement.

04:01:20.140 --> 04:01:21.820
So about that improvement,

04:01:21.820 --> 04:01:26.820
that actually is what's under section 47607.2B3.

04:01:26.940 --> 04:01:30.100
And while RBC has been in operation for four years,

04:01:30.100 --> 04:01:32.060
the only improvement data you have

04:01:32.060 --> 04:01:35.300
is one single data point from one single source.

04:01:35.300 --> 04:01:37.500
And you don't have any analysis to explain

04:01:37.500 --> 04:01:40.500
why that data point is so inexplicably out of sync

04:01:40.500 --> 04:01:42.580
with averages from other schools and districts

04:01:42.580 --> 04:01:43.900
across the state.

04:01:43.900 --> 04:01:46.220
One oddball data point from one source

04:01:46.220 --> 04:01:49.100
is definitely not clear or compelling.

04:01:50.540 --> 04:01:53.100
And since you can't get a full picture for all years

04:01:53.100 --> 04:01:55.420
and all grades just from CASP scores,

04:01:55.420 --> 04:02:00.420
section 47607.2B3 as envisioned under AB 1505

04:02:01.180 --> 04:02:04.780
clearly requires other verified academic assessment data

04:02:04.780 --> 04:02:07.660
in addition to state indicators or CASP

04:02:07.660 --> 04:02:09.060
so that decisions can be made

04:02:09.060 --> 04:02:11.100
on clear and convincing evidence.

04:02:11.100 --> 04:02:13.180
Despite RBC's minimal CASP data,

04:02:13.180 --> 04:02:16.900
RBC did not provide and CDE did not require

04:02:16.900 --> 04:02:19.420
any additional academic assessment data

04:02:19.420 --> 04:02:21.420
with which to substantiate your approval.

04:02:21.420 --> 04:02:23.140
None, there's nothing.

04:02:23.140 --> 04:02:26.420
So if you approve this appeal without this data,

04:02:26.420 --> 04:02:27.940
you're setting a dangerous precedent

04:02:27.940 --> 04:02:29.500
that doesn't follow the law.

04:02:31.060 --> 04:02:34.460
And academic accountability seems to be one thing

04:02:34.460 --> 04:02:36.420
that we can all agree on.

04:02:36.420 --> 04:02:39.620
Without that and demonstrated financial sustainability,

04:02:39.620 --> 04:02:41.860
you simply don't have what you need to justify

04:02:41.860 --> 04:02:45.700
going against the legislative intent of AB 1505

04:02:45.700 --> 04:02:49.100
in overturning our locally elected school board's decision

04:02:49.100 --> 04:02:51.140
to deny this renewal.

04:02:51.140 --> 04:02:54.260
And in closing, I wanna turn to Sue Ann Evans.

04:02:56.060 --> 04:02:56.900
Thank you.

04:03:00.580 --> 04:03:02.580
I'm not sure if it's switched on.

04:03:02.580 --> 04:03:03.420
Yep, go ahead.

04:03:03.660 --> 04:03:04.500
Thank you.

04:03:06.500 --> 04:03:07.900
You've seen me here before.

04:03:07.900 --> 04:03:09.460
I've been doing this for a long time

04:03:09.460 --> 04:03:11.300
working in the charter world.

04:03:11.300 --> 04:03:13.980
And I have actually been pretty struck

04:03:13.980 --> 04:03:17.660
by how this process has unfolded.

04:03:17.660 --> 04:03:21.140
You've certainly seen our materials.

04:03:21.140 --> 04:03:23.340
There's been a lack of transparency.

04:03:23.340 --> 04:03:25.420
There's been a lack of communication.

04:03:25.420 --> 04:03:28.380
I've heard a lot today in the general agenda

04:03:28.380 --> 04:03:31.780
about collaboration that has been entirely absent

04:03:32.740 --> 04:03:34.660
from CDE and-

04:03:34.660 --> 04:03:38.820
Excuse me, your time is now up.

04:03:38.820 --> 04:03:40.140
I'm sorry.

04:03:40.140 --> 04:03:41.620
Thank you.

04:03:41.620 --> 04:03:43.780
If you could look at the screen,

04:03:43.780 --> 04:03:47.220
that's my timer, just that we're out of time.

04:03:47.220 --> 04:03:48.540
But these are the options

04:03:48.540 --> 04:03:50.060
that we're asking the board to consider.

04:03:50.060 --> 04:03:51.180
Thank you.

04:03:51.180 --> 04:03:52.300
Thank you very much.

04:03:53.180 --> 04:03:56.140
So I appreciate both Ross Valley Charter

04:03:56.140 --> 04:03:59.540
and the district for your presentation.

04:03:59.540 --> 04:04:01.340
We're gonna open up the phone line

04:04:01.900 --> 04:04:03.500
for public comment.

04:04:03.500 --> 04:04:06.100
Members of the public wishing to provide comment

04:04:06.100 --> 04:04:09.740
on this item may do so by calling the telephone number

04:04:09.740 --> 04:04:12.740
and using the access code provided on the slide.

04:04:12.740 --> 04:04:16.220
So let's see if we can get the slide up right now.

04:04:19.540 --> 04:04:20.540
I need the previous presenter

04:04:20.540 --> 04:04:21.700
to stop sharing their screen.

04:04:21.700 --> 04:04:22.540
Thank you.

04:04:22.540 --> 04:04:27.540
All right, so you're gonna call 712-770-5316.

04:04:34.820 --> 04:04:39.820
Your access code is 433-7117.

04:04:39.940 --> 04:04:41.580
So I just wanna remind you

04:04:41.580 --> 04:04:43.980
to turn down the speaker volume of your computer

04:04:43.980 --> 04:04:46.060
if you're following the live feed.

04:04:46.060 --> 04:04:48.300
You will be limited to one minute.

04:04:48.300 --> 04:04:51.060
And also I'm gonna remind all callers

04:04:51.060 --> 04:04:53.180
that you need to be very respectful

04:04:53.180 --> 04:04:56.100
when you make your public comments

04:04:56.100 --> 04:04:58.260
to the board regarding this item.

04:04:58.260 --> 04:05:03.260
So are there any public comments on this item eight?

04:05:04.340 --> 04:05:07.300
Yes, we have 25 at the moment.

04:05:10.100 --> 04:05:10.940
Please begin.

04:05:13.420 --> 04:05:14.260
Hello, caller.

04:05:14.260 --> 04:05:17.060
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:05:17.060 --> 04:05:18.020
You have one minute.

04:05:18.020 --> 04:05:19.420
Your time begins now.

04:05:22.020 --> 04:05:23.220
Is it me?

04:05:23.220 --> 04:05:24.500
My name is Heather Bennett

04:05:24.500 --> 04:05:26.180
and I'm a parent of two children

04:05:26.180 --> 04:05:28.300
here in the Ross Valley School District.

04:05:28.300 --> 04:05:31.500
I have been in front of this board several times now,

04:05:31.500 --> 04:05:33.620
once bringing you a hard copy, I believe,

04:05:33.620 --> 04:05:35.940
of what was over 2,000 signatures

04:05:35.940 --> 04:05:38.500
of Ross Valley citizens and parents

04:05:38.500 --> 04:05:42.140
asking you to please rescind this charter.

04:05:42.140 --> 04:05:44.340
Please know that no matter how many people

04:05:44.340 --> 04:05:48.060
may show up today to support our public school district,

04:05:48.060 --> 04:05:50.580
know that it is not all of us.

04:05:50.620 --> 04:05:52.340
We are the majority,

04:05:52.340 --> 04:05:56.020
but this community is exhausted by this ongoing battle.

04:05:56.020 --> 04:05:57.940
We need this to end.

04:05:57.940 --> 04:06:01.460
Years ago, when I was president of the PTA

04:06:01.460 --> 04:06:03.580
and as a parent at Manor School,

04:06:03.580 --> 04:06:07.580
I saw with my own eyes how these very same teachers

04:06:07.580 --> 04:06:11.260
of the charter turned away students with special needs

04:06:11.260 --> 04:06:14.780
or who were brown or black or spoke a different language.

04:06:14.780 --> 04:06:18.300
These same teachers are now exploiting these students

04:06:18.300 --> 04:06:20.820
to try and boost their lagging enrollment.

04:06:20.820 --> 04:06:24.260
And now, as so many of us fully expected,

04:06:24.260 --> 04:06:26.380
when you disaggregate the-

04:06:26.380 --> 04:06:27.220
Thank you, caller.

04:06:27.220 --> 04:06:28.260
Your time is up.

04:06:35.100 --> 04:06:36.460
Hello, caller.

04:06:36.460 --> 04:06:38.980
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:06:38.980 --> 04:06:39.980
You have one minute.

04:06:39.980 --> 04:06:41.260
Your time begins now.

04:06:42.820 --> 04:06:44.300
My name is Erin Heath.

04:06:44.300 --> 04:06:46.620
I'm a resident of Ross Valley.

04:06:47.580 --> 04:06:49.740
This is a precedent-setting decision.

04:06:49.740 --> 04:06:52.780
The findings by the district's third-party financial expert

04:06:52.780 --> 04:06:55.620
indicate this charter will be insolvent

04:06:55.620 --> 04:06:57.340
before the end of the year.

04:06:57.340 --> 04:06:59.820
More concerning, the analysis of their test scores

04:06:59.820 --> 04:07:02.660
using disaggregated data shows a significant equity

04:07:02.660 --> 04:07:05.340
gap between native English speakers

04:07:05.340 --> 04:07:06.900
and English learners.

04:07:06.900 --> 04:07:10.020
Their own director expressed concerns about his teachers'

04:07:10.020 --> 04:07:12.700
ability to effectively serve their EL students.

04:07:13.420 --> 04:07:15.220
This is a very real issue.

04:07:15.220 --> 04:07:18.140
I urge you not to dismiss the district's thorough analysis,

04:07:18.140 --> 04:07:21.660
which followed all AB 1505 guidelines.

04:07:21.660 --> 04:07:24.620
The CDEs did not, and the individual who oversaw

04:07:24.620 --> 04:07:27.260
the analysis for the CDE has been discredited.

04:07:27.820 --> 04:07:29.660
The children of our state deserve better.

04:07:29.660 --> 04:07:32.820
As AB 1505 intended, please rely on the exhaustive

04:07:32.820 --> 04:07:36.660
analysis of the district and their third-party experts

04:07:36.660 --> 04:07:39.060
and deny Ross Valley Charter's petition for renewal.

04:07:39.060 --> 04:07:40.060
Thank you.

04:07:46.220 --> 04:07:48.220
Hello, caller.

04:07:48.220 --> 04:07:50.820
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:07:50.820 --> 04:07:52.820
Your time begins now.

04:08:04.820 --> 04:08:06.820
Caller, are you there?

04:08:15.220 --> 04:08:20.220
Hello, my name is Paula Connolly and I am an RVSD parent

04:08:24.700 --> 04:08:27.020
as well as president of our local high school's

04:08:27.020 --> 04:08:28.260
parent club.

04:08:28.260 --> 04:08:31.100
On November 10th, my community school board voted

04:08:31.100 --> 04:08:35.180
unanimously to deny RVS RVC's renewal petition.

04:08:35.740 --> 04:08:38.380
Prior to this meeting, you received close to 100

04:08:38.380 --> 04:08:40.900
letters from members of our local community

04:08:40.900 --> 04:08:43.580
who oppose this renewal, including one

04:08:43.580 --> 04:08:46.340
from the California Teachers Association.

04:08:46.340 --> 04:08:49.060
This is nearly double the numbers of letters you've

04:08:49.060 --> 04:08:51.420
received in support of the renewal.

04:08:51.420 --> 04:08:55.380
Please honor AB 1505 as you make this precedent

04:08:55.380 --> 04:08:56.780
setting decision.

04:08:56.780 --> 04:08:59.820
Please honor our local school board and our local

04:08:59.820 --> 04:09:02.860
communities who are intimately familiar with the operations

04:09:02.860 --> 04:09:06.060
of RVC and have the best interest of the students

04:09:06.060 --> 04:09:07.260
at heart. Thank you.

04:09:11.060 --> 04:09:11.780
Hello, caller.

04:09:11.820 --> 04:09:14.340
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:09:14.340 --> 04:09:16.500
You have one minute. Your time begins now.

04:09:19.060 --> 04:09:20.940
Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond

04:09:20.940 --> 04:09:21.780
and board members.

04:09:21.780 --> 04:09:24.220
My name is Gina Plait from the California Charter

04:09:24.220 --> 04:09:26.780
Schools Association speaking in strong support

04:09:26.780 --> 04:09:28.620
of Ross Valley Charter School.

04:09:28.620 --> 04:09:32.220
CCSA has worked with Ross Valley, the team for the last

04:09:32.220 --> 04:09:36.500
five years, initially on their original submission.

04:09:36.500 --> 04:09:38.900
We supported them through their approval.

04:09:38.900 --> 04:09:41.460
We worked as thought partners throughout their term

04:09:41.460 --> 04:09:44.140
and we're now advocating for their renewal.

04:09:44.140 --> 04:09:47.420
Five years ago, Ross Valley made a commitment to this board,

04:09:47.420 --> 04:09:49.460
their community, and most importantly,

04:09:49.460 --> 04:09:52.100
their students to serve them with excellence.

04:09:52.100 --> 04:09:54.180
And they've made good on that promise.

04:09:54.180 --> 04:09:57.620
They meet all renewal criteria under the applicable renewal

04:09:57.620 --> 04:10:01.340
standard and their data and outcomes demonstrate increases

04:10:01.340 --> 04:10:05.500
in academic achievement for all students and all subgroups,

04:10:05.500 --> 04:10:08.220
which clearly grants them renewal for a five-year

04:10:08.220 --> 04:10:10.660
term under AB 1505.

04:10:10.700 --> 04:10:13.060
We kindly request your approval for the renewal

04:10:13.060 --> 04:10:14.940
of Ross Valley Charter. Thank you.

04:10:25.180 --> 04:10:27.460
Hello, caller. Please state your name and affiliation

04:10:27.460 --> 04:10:29.180
for the record. You have one minute.

04:10:29.180 --> 04:10:30.300
Your time begins now.

04:10:33.300 --> 04:10:35.460
Good afternoon. This is Sarah Kaminsky on behalf

04:10:35.460 --> 04:10:37.300
of the California County Superintendent's

04:10:37.300 --> 04:10:40.060
Educational Services Association representing

04:10:40.060 --> 04:10:41.980
the 58 county superintendents and schools.

04:10:42.700 --> 04:10:44.820
This designation by the board, in this case,

04:10:44.820 --> 04:10:48.300
to a county office, is the first of its kind under AB 1505.

04:10:48.820 --> 04:10:51.020
There are two more renewal appeals coming to the board

04:10:51.020 --> 04:10:53.460
in May and potentially more than 30 to follow.

04:10:54.020 --> 04:10:56.460
We want these designations to be successful both

04:10:56.460 --> 04:10:58.540
for the students and for the new authorizer.

04:10:59.060 --> 04:11:01.740
This means being able to participate in the consultation

04:11:01.740 --> 04:11:03.900
and lead up to the board's designation.

04:11:03.900 --> 04:11:05.900
It means having time to operationalize

04:11:05.900 --> 04:11:08.380
these new responsibilities and it means having process.

04:11:09.020 --> 04:11:11.420
Not every designation will go to a county office

04:11:11.420 --> 04:11:13.300
but we hope to be your partner in building out

04:11:13.300 --> 04:11:14.580
this new process.

04:11:14.580 --> 04:11:16.340
We look forward to working with the board to ensure

04:11:16.340 --> 04:11:20.260
future authorizer transfers will be successful under AB 1505.

04:11:20.260 --> 04:11:21.460
Thank you for your time.

04:11:27.180 --> 04:11:28.740
Hello, caller. Please state your name

04:11:28.740 --> 04:11:31.420
and affiliation for the record. You have one minute.

04:11:31.420 --> 04:11:32.620
Your time begins now.

04:11:32.620 --> 04:11:37.540
Good afternoon, members of the board.

04:11:37.540 --> 04:11:38.580
My name is Edward Yates.

04:11:38.580 --> 04:11:41.020
I'm a government transparency attorney

04:11:41.020 --> 04:11:42.980
in San Francisco, California.

04:11:42.980 --> 04:11:45.900
I represent Robin Goldman in regard to RBC's petition.

04:11:46.420 --> 04:11:50.020
I requested the board provide me an extra 30 seconds or so

04:11:50.020 --> 04:11:53.780
given the time and trouble Ms. Goldman has taken in this case

04:11:53.780 --> 04:11:56.060
and that she's retained me.

04:11:56.700 --> 04:11:58.700
This board should deny RBC's petition

04:11:58.700 --> 04:12:00.700
because of the disturbing pattern of incompetence

04:12:00.700 --> 04:12:03.620
by CDE staff and oversight of RBC.

04:12:04.300 --> 04:12:07.780
Not Mr. Thurman but the civil service staff in the CSD.

04:12:08.420 --> 04:12:12.420
CD staff appear to deliberately violate the public record draft

04:12:12.420 --> 04:12:14.420
several times in the last three years

04:12:14.420 --> 04:12:16.900
by withholding records that were only released

04:12:16.900 --> 04:12:18.700
when I had to make a demand

04:12:18.700 --> 04:12:21.780
and your general counsel prudently released the records.

04:12:21.780 --> 04:12:25.100
Other incompetence, CDE staff possibly violated FERPA

04:12:25.100 --> 04:12:27.780
and civil rights of all RBC children

04:12:27.780 --> 04:12:29.380
by sending my client.

04:12:36.580 --> 04:12:38.180
No, you said to cut them off.

04:12:45.140 --> 04:12:46.140
Do we have another caller?

04:12:46.140 --> 04:12:50.140
The last caller, you were accidentally cut off by me.

04:12:50.140 --> 04:12:52.020
My apologies. Please call back in.

04:12:52.020 --> 04:12:58.900
Hello caller. Please state your name and affiliation

04:12:58.900 --> 04:13:00.700
for the record. You have one minute.

04:13:00.700 --> 04:13:01.780
Your time begins now.

04:13:09.460 --> 04:13:12.340
Hi. My name is Kim Lewis and I'm a parent

04:13:12.340 --> 04:13:13.460
in the school district.

04:13:14.340 --> 04:13:16.980
As a parent within the school district and an accountant

04:13:16.980 --> 04:13:19.220
I'd like to point out that RBC's presentation

04:13:19.220 --> 04:13:21.700
of their financial position is vastly different

04:13:22.020 --> 04:13:24.140
than what's being presented here.

04:13:24.140 --> 04:13:26.620
What was presented at school board meetings

04:13:26.620 --> 04:13:30.300
was almost a million dollars in debt versus the 400,000

04:13:30.300 --> 04:13:34.740
shown here in analysis of the in here of the analysis

04:13:34.740 --> 04:13:38.140
of the independent accountant of their information

04:13:38.140 --> 04:13:40.380
shows they are not economically viable.

04:13:40.380 --> 04:13:42.780
Please listen to the consultant and our local board

04:13:42.780 --> 04:13:45.180
as they have been monitoring you properly

04:13:45.180 --> 04:13:48.340
as the CDE has not done so.

04:13:48.340 --> 04:13:50.500
I encourage you to deny this charter.

04:13:51.700 --> 04:14:00.580
Hello caller. Please state your name

04:14:00.580 --> 04:14:02.220
and affiliation for the record.

04:14:02.220 --> 04:14:04.300
You have one minute. Your time begins now.

04:14:07.940 --> 04:14:09.700
Good afternoon. Carlos Machado with the

04:14:09.700 --> 04:14:12.060
California School Boards Association.

04:14:12.060 --> 04:14:14.660
CSBA supports the Ross Valley School District's

04:14:14.660 --> 04:14:17.740
denial of the renewal of the Ross Valley charter petition.

04:14:18.380 --> 04:14:21.300
The legislature clearly intended to return charter

04:14:21.300 --> 04:14:24.540
schools to local control through AB 1505.

04:14:25.380 --> 04:14:27.100
This is because local school districts

04:14:27.100 --> 04:14:29.500
and county offices of education are better suited

04:14:29.500 --> 04:14:31.620
to understand the educational needs of students

04:14:31.620 --> 04:14:34.940
in their area and the community impacts of charter schools.

04:14:35.660 --> 04:14:39.660
By approving a renewal that the district board voted down

04:14:39.660 --> 04:14:42.700
by a five to zero vote the state board will remove

04:14:42.700 --> 04:14:45.580
the important local control built into current law.

04:14:46.260 --> 04:14:49.620
The board of trustees vote was based on reasonable concerns

04:14:49.660 --> 04:14:52.060
including the debt held by the charter school.

04:14:52.580 --> 04:14:55.620
As a result the SBA urges the board to deny

04:14:55.620 --> 04:14:58.500
the renewal petition of Ross Valley Charter. Thank you.

04:15:03.980 --> 04:15:05.820
Hello caller. Please state your name

04:15:05.820 --> 04:15:07.260
and affiliation for the record.

04:15:07.260 --> 04:15:09.420
You have one minute. Your time begins now.

04:15:12.020 --> 04:15:14.700
Rob said excuse me Rob Sandusky a community member

04:15:14.700 --> 04:15:15.500
and parent.

04:15:15.500 --> 04:15:17.940
I ask the SBE to honor the decision of the Ross Valley

04:15:18.180 --> 04:15:20.260
school district in the intent of AB 1505

04:15:20.260 --> 04:15:22.180
and their denial of the Ross Valley Charter's

04:15:22.180 --> 04:15:23.460
renewal petition.

04:15:23.460 --> 04:15:26.180
To override the recommendation of local publicly elected

04:15:26.180 --> 04:15:28.780
officials announced a taxation without representation.

04:15:28.780 --> 04:15:31.020
The review of the Ross Valley charter schools program

04:15:31.020 --> 04:15:34.940
by RBSD was extensive thorough and based on expert testimony

04:15:34.940 --> 04:15:37.740
and years of experience with RBC and their leadership.

04:15:37.740 --> 04:15:40.380
Many red flags were raised in the RBSD report.

04:15:40.380 --> 04:15:43.300
Importantly the disaggregated information data showing

04:15:43.300 --> 04:15:45.740
an achievement gap and underserving of heavily

04:15:45.780 --> 04:15:49.060
recruited DLL students and across the program finance

04:15:49.060 --> 04:15:50.020
and governance.

04:15:50.020 --> 04:15:52.060
It should have triggered a complete and thorough

04:15:52.060 --> 04:15:54.860
independent audit of RBC's entire program.

04:15:54.860 --> 04:15:57.420
That this hasn't been done previously despite five

04:15:57.420 --> 04:15:59.740
years of complaints by the district and the local

04:15:59.740 --> 04:16:02.700
community to the CDE demonstrates insufficient

04:16:02.700 --> 04:16:05.220
oversight by RBC's authorizing agency.

04:16:05.220 --> 04:16:09.140
Again I ask the SBE honor AB 1505 and the findings

04:16:09.140 --> 04:16:11.860
of the locally elected RBSD officials or at least

04:16:11.860 --> 04:16:14.380
conduct a complete thorough and independent audit

04:16:14.420 --> 04:16:17.100
of the data related to the Ross Valley.

04:16:17.100 --> 04:16:18.860
Thank you caller, your time is up.

04:16:22.820 --> 04:16:24.940
Hello caller, please state your name and affiliation

04:16:24.940 --> 04:16:25.780
for the record.

04:16:25.780 --> 04:16:27.780
You have one minute, your time begins now.

04:16:30.660 --> 04:16:33.220
Good afternoon, my name is John Buettler

04:16:33.220 --> 04:16:35.300
and I'm a Ross Valley community member

04:16:35.300 --> 04:16:38.580
and I strongly support the Ross Valley Charter School

04:16:38.580 --> 04:16:42.380
and the tremendous benefits it has brought to our community.

04:16:42.420 --> 04:16:46.500
While our school district has engaged in incredibly

04:16:46.500 --> 04:16:48.780
dishonest and aggressive assault on the charter

04:16:48.780 --> 04:16:52.540
and singled out its most valuable and vulnerable families,

04:16:52.540 --> 04:16:56.580
RBC has instead focused on serving its diverse students,

04:16:56.580 --> 04:16:59.220
building community with their families while providing

04:16:59.220 --> 04:17:03.700
them an exemplary meaningful education.

04:17:03.700 --> 04:17:06.500
RBC has more than earned a five year renewal.

04:17:06.500 --> 04:17:07.700
Thank you for your time.

04:17:12.420 --> 04:17:14.780
Hello caller, please state your name and affiliation

04:17:14.780 --> 04:17:15.620
for the record.

04:17:15.620 --> 04:17:17.780
You have one minute, your time begins now.

04:17:21.380 --> 04:17:25.420
Hi, my name is Merrill Machino and I'm an RBC parent.

04:17:25.420 --> 04:17:27.540
I also have another caller on this line,

04:17:27.540 --> 04:17:30.340
so I'm asking for two minutes for two different,

04:17:30.340 --> 04:17:33.700
you know one minute each for two different callers.

04:17:33.700 --> 04:17:36.740
As an RBC parent it's really sad to hear the misinformation

04:17:36.740 --> 04:17:39.300
that our local school district has been spreading

04:17:39.300 --> 04:17:41.060
to its families about our school.

04:17:41.220 --> 04:17:42.620
And that's a lot of the calls that you're hearing,

04:17:42.620 --> 04:17:45.580
it's coming straight from the school district.

04:17:45.580 --> 04:17:48.460
For our family moving to RBC from the Ross Valley

04:17:48.460 --> 04:17:51.780
School District made a night and day difference

04:17:51.780 --> 04:17:55.420
in the engagement and academic success of our kids.

04:17:55.420 --> 04:17:57.580
Having classrooms where children are recognized,

04:17:57.580 --> 04:18:00.460
understood and having their curiosity

04:18:00.460 --> 04:18:03.620
channeled constructively makes kids feel valued.

04:18:03.620 --> 04:18:07.140
It was not how they felt in the school district.

04:18:07.140 --> 04:18:09.900
It's wonderful to see our kids actually engaged in school,

04:18:09.940 --> 04:18:14.860
want to go to school and be able to shine academically

04:18:14.860 --> 04:18:16.820
and have their test scores improve.

04:18:17.980 --> 04:18:20.300
RBC is a safe and welcoming school

04:18:20.300 --> 04:18:22.100
for all children and families.

04:18:23.140 --> 04:18:24.980
Thank you caller, your time is up.

04:18:31.900 --> 04:18:34.260
Hello caller, please state your name and affiliation

04:18:34.260 --> 04:18:36.300
for the record, your time begins now.

04:18:40.100 --> 04:18:47.260
Are you there caller?

04:18:56.140 --> 04:18:58.340
Hello caller, please state your name and affiliation

04:18:58.340 --> 04:19:00.180
for the record, your time begins now.

04:19:03.740 --> 04:19:05.940
State board members, my name is Lorraine Richards

04:19:05.940 --> 04:19:08.500
and I am representing the California Teacher's Association.

04:19:08.580 --> 04:19:10.860
CTA is concerned with the CBE's approach

04:19:10.860 --> 04:19:12.700
to Ross Valley charter appeal.

04:19:12.700 --> 04:19:14.980
It undermines the intent of the legislature

04:19:14.980 --> 04:19:16.580
regarding the renewal process

04:19:16.580 --> 04:19:21.580
with state board authorized charters under 47605.9.

04:19:22.620 --> 04:19:25.420
The district board voted unanimously

04:19:25.420 --> 04:19:26.980
to deny the renewal petition

04:19:26.980 --> 04:19:31.980
and issued notices of violation as outlined in 47607E.

04:19:32.580 --> 04:19:34.940
RBC has challenged the district's authority

04:19:34.940 --> 04:19:37.100
to issue notices of violation,

04:19:37.100 --> 04:19:39.300
but not to other aspects of their authority

04:19:39.300 --> 04:19:41.580
to consider its renewal petition.

04:19:41.580 --> 04:19:43.860
This position is untenable

04:19:43.860 --> 04:19:47.900
and it disregards the legislative intent of AB 1505

04:19:47.900 --> 04:19:50.980
to return chartering authority from the state board

04:19:50.980 --> 04:19:52.980
to local educational agencies.

04:19:52.980 --> 04:19:55.860
CTA requests that CBE and state board address

04:19:55.860 --> 04:19:58.140
these concerns so that the process moving forward

04:19:58.140 --> 04:19:59.980
for state board authorized charters

04:19:59.980 --> 04:20:02.300
respects the clear intent of the legislature.

04:20:02.300 --> 04:20:03.140
Thank you.

04:20:08.060 --> 04:20:08.900
Hello, caller.

04:20:08.900 --> 04:20:11.100
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:20:11.100 --> 04:20:12.180
You have one minute.

04:20:12.180 --> 04:20:13.540
Your time begins now.

04:20:19.300 --> 04:20:20.700
Hi.

04:20:20.700 --> 04:20:22.100
Hello, my name is Michael Miller

04:20:22.100 --> 04:20:25.900
and I'm a parent of a RBC nine-year-old.

04:20:25.900 --> 04:20:28.700
My daughter, she goes there in Fairfax

04:20:28.700 --> 04:20:31.380
and she had previously been in a private school in Marin

04:20:31.380 --> 04:20:34.020
and was having some difficulties with reading and math

04:20:34.020 --> 04:20:36.180
and that was before the pandemic.

04:20:36.220 --> 04:20:38.060
Her needs weren't being properly addressed

04:20:38.060 --> 04:20:41.300
and in fact, her progress reports were very negative

04:20:41.300 --> 04:20:45.500
and critical and not very empathetic with her situation.

04:20:45.500 --> 04:20:48.780
When the pandemic hit her prior school was ill-equipped

04:20:48.780 --> 04:20:50.620
to handle the online learning

04:20:50.620 --> 04:20:52.860
and I was expected to print out most of the assignments

04:20:52.860 --> 04:20:55.980
myself and it was very time consuming and difficult.

04:20:55.980 --> 04:20:58.620
My wife and I felt so lost with nowhere to turn.

04:20:58.620 --> 04:21:01.260
Then we were so fortunate to find RBC.

04:21:01.260 --> 04:21:03.580
From the beginning, we were warmly welcomed

04:21:03.580 --> 04:21:04.700
by the entire staff.

04:21:04.700 --> 04:21:06.380
They generally care about our daughter

04:21:06.380 --> 04:21:10.780
and put a solid plan together for her future development

04:21:10.780 --> 04:21:14.940
and she has been blossoming since she's been at RBC

04:21:14.940 --> 04:21:15.900
and I'm so happy.

04:21:15.900 --> 04:21:17.300
I don't know where we would be without them.

04:21:17.300 --> 04:21:19.020
We are so appreciative of their efforts.

04:21:19.020 --> 04:21:20.340
They truly care about us.

04:21:23.420 --> 04:21:24.660
Your time is up, caller.

04:21:28.340 --> 04:21:29.540
Caller, please state your name

04:21:29.540 --> 04:21:31.020
and affiliation for the record.

04:21:31.020 --> 04:21:32.020
You have one minute.

04:21:32.020 --> 04:21:33.380
Your time begins now.

04:21:35.700 --> 04:21:39.980
Hi, my name is Victoria Kambi and my son goes to RBC.

04:21:39.980 --> 04:21:43.100
He's a young third grade long haired American Indian boy

04:21:43.100 --> 04:21:45.220
and he he loves his school.

04:21:45.220 --> 04:21:50.020
A school creates a unique and inspiring academic place

04:21:50.020 --> 04:21:52.740
for him socially emotionally supportive creative

04:21:52.740 --> 04:21:54.820
and inspiring inclusive community.

04:21:54.820 --> 04:21:57.220
And I want my that I wanted for my child.

04:21:57.220 --> 04:21:58.580
I've worked at two different schools

04:21:58.580 --> 04:22:01.740
at Ross Valley School District and although they have

04:22:01.740 --> 04:22:03.700
a lot of strengths right now they were not a good

04:22:03.900 --> 04:22:05.140
fit for my family.

04:22:05.140 --> 04:22:07.140
If Ross Valley School District is concerned

04:22:07.140 --> 04:22:08.740
about the best interests of the children

04:22:08.740 --> 04:22:10.660
I would hope that they would be inclusive

04:22:10.660 --> 04:22:13.700
and support the thriving community of RBC

04:22:13.700 --> 04:22:15.540
which has been a gift for my family.

04:22:15.540 --> 04:22:16.380
Thank you.

04:22:22.740 --> 04:22:23.580
Hello, caller.

04:22:23.580 --> 04:22:25.820
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:22:25.820 --> 04:22:26.940
You have one minute.

04:22:26.940 --> 04:22:28.220
Your time begins now.

04:22:31.820 --> 04:22:33.100
My name is David Drury.

04:22:33.140 --> 04:22:35.420
I live in the Ross Valley District

04:22:35.420 --> 04:22:38.420
and I've been a parent and volunteer at RBC

04:22:38.420 --> 04:22:40.620
for the last three years.

04:22:40.620 --> 04:22:42.620
The one size fits all approach

04:22:42.620 --> 04:22:44.820
that traditional public schools offer

04:22:44.820 --> 04:22:46.860
does not work for all kids.

04:22:46.860 --> 04:22:48.940
It's great to see charts and graphs and theories

04:22:48.940 --> 04:22:52.500
and all that but as a volunteer I have seen firsthand

04:22:52.500 --> 04:22:56.060
the transformation of kids who have come to RBC.

04:22:56.060 --> 04:22:58.860
I'm talking about kids with severe learning disabilities

04:22:58.860 --> 04:23:01.580
English language challenges or sensitivities

04:23:01.940 --> 04:23:05.460
that don't find a place in traditional schools.

04:23:05.460 --> 04:23:06.860
There was this one kid,

04:23:06.860 --> 04:23:08.500
all the public school could do with him

04:23:08.500 --> 04:23:11.980
was lock him in a padded isolation room all day.

04:23:11.980 --> 04:23:15.460
When he came to RBC he was shown love and acceptance.

04:23:15.460 --> 04:23:17.780
It took months but he came around,

04:23:17.780 --> 04:23:20.180
learned to trust and found his place.

04:23:20.180 --> 04:23:22.420
Today he is a model student.

04:23:22.420 --> 04:23:24.380
That is just one extreme example

04:23:24.380 --> 04:23:26.980
but the same model of love, acceptance

04:23:26.980 --> 04:23:29.220
and individually paced learning

04:23:29.260 --> 04:23:31.820
is happening for a couple of hundred kids every.

04:23:32.820 --> 04:23:34.100
Your time is up caller.

04:23:37.860 --> 04:23:39.140
Caller please state your name

04:23:39.140 --> 04:23:40.660

04:23:40.660 --> 04:23:41.820
You have one minute.

04:23:41.820 --> 04:23:43.180
Your time begins now.

04:23:46.660 --> 04:23:48.460
Hello, my name is David Talamo

04:23:48.460 --> 04:23:51.140
and I'm a Ross Valley charter parent.

04:23:51.140 --> 04:23:54.540
This is the fourth year my daughter has been in the school

04:23:54.540 --> 04:23:58.620
and it's been a delight to see the diversity in the school,

04:23:58.620 --> 04:24:00.660
the strength of the school community,

04:24:00.660 --> 04:24:03.100
to have opportunities to participate

04:24:03.100 --> 04:24:05.820
in what is a really strong school community,

04:24:05.820 --> 04:24:08.420
to see the devotion of the teachers

04:24:08.420 --> 04:24:10.580
and the broad array of needs that are being met

04:24:10.580 --> 04:24:12.780
by students in the school.

04:24:12.780 --> 04:24:15.380
As a result my daughter's a lifelong learner

04:24:15.380 --> 04:24:18.500
and has a lot of enthusiasm for school.

04:24:18.500 --> 04:24:19.940
As a marriage and family therapist

04:24:19.940 --> 04:24:22.740
working in the community I see all the time

04:24:22.740 --> 04:24:25.100
kids and teens who have struggled in school

04:24:25.100 --> 04:24:26.980
and been turned off by it.

04:24:26.980 --> 04:24:28.460
I'm delighted the school exists

04:24:28.460 --> 04:24:30.860
and I hope they will be allowed to continue to do so.

04:24:30.860 --> 04:24:31.700
Thank you.

04:24:35.260 --> 04:24:36.220
Thank you caller.

04:24:37.740 --> 04:24:39.420
Next caller please state your name

04:24:39.420 --> 04:24:40.980
and affiliation for the record.

04:24:40.980 --> 04:24:42.060
You have one minute.

04:24:42.060 --> 04:24:43.380
Your time begins now.

04:24:51.740 --> 04:24:52.780
Are you there caller?

04:24:54.460 --> 04:24:55.460
I just spoke.

04:24:56.980 --> 04:24:57.820
I just spoke.

04:24:59.820 --> 04:25:01.740
Caller please state your name

04:25:01.740 --> 04:25:03.260
and affiliation for the record.

04:25:03.260 --> 04:25:04.140
You have one minute.

04:25:04.140 --> 04:25:05.420
Your time begins now.

04:25:09.300 --> 04:25:11.860
My name is Zoe Soway and I'm a biracial

04:25:11.860 --> 04:25:14.580
former Ross Valley Charter School student.

04:25:14.580 --> 04:25:16.740
At RBC everything done in class

04:25:16.740 --> 04:25:19.260
was made for students to grow their minds.

04:25:19.260 --> 04:25:21.860
There were always ways to create challenges

04:25:21.860 --> 04:25:25.860
or remove obstacles depending on each student's work stamina.

04:25:25.860 --> 04:25:27.260
It wasn't names and dates.

04:25:27.260 --> 04:25:29.740
It was stories and times of change.

04:25:29.740 --> 04:25:32.100
When you walk onto the RBC campus

04:25:32.100 --> 04:25:33.780
the walls are colored by the brilliance

04:25:33.780 --> 04:25:36.700
of children's creations and all their stories to share.

04:25:37.620 --> 04:25:39.620
You aren't just asked to put pen to paper.

04:25:39.620 --> 04:25:41.580
You're invited to travel with the ink

04:25:41.580 --> 04:25:42.580
to share and to think.

04:25:43.380 --> 04:25:46.620
My best takeaway from the school was the connections I made.

04:25:46.620 --> 04:25:48.620
Even as a seventh grader as I explore

04:25:48.620 --> 04:25:52.060
and write about the suffragists in the early 1900s

04:25:52.060 --> 04:25:55.220
and even as I run my business as an artist on the daily

04:25:55.220 --> 04:25:58.220
I find myself turning to my teachers from RBC

04:25:58.220 --> 04:26:00.780
to seek advice edits and different perspectives.

04:26:01.780 --> 04:26:04.980
When you have a teacher at RBC you have a teacher for life

04:26:04.980 --> 04:26:06.580
because at the Ross Valley Charter School

04:26:06.580 --> 04:26:09.020
curiosity is empowered. Please keep this.

04:26:11.540 --> 04:26:13.060
Thank you caller your time is up.

04:26:18.300 --> 04:26:21.540
Caller please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:26:21.540 --> 04:26:24.580
You have one minute. Please begin now.

04:26:25.980 --> 04:26:27.980
Hi.

04:26:31.660 --> 04:26:33.940
Hi my name is Jennifer Frisch and I'm the parent

04:26:33.940 --> 04:26:36.860
of a child who's at Ross Valley Charter School.

04:26:37.700 --> 04:26:40.060
I wanted to express my support for the school.

04:26:40.780 --> 04:26:44.460
My family has been welcome at RBC since we started

04:26:44.460 --> 04:26:45.780
looking at it years ago.

04:26:46.580 --> 04:26:49.020
The inquiry based educational model has really worked

04:26:49.020 --> 04:26:51.740
for my child and allowed him to explore subjects

04:26:51.740 --> 04:26:53.580
on a deeper level that he might not have gotten

04:26:53.740 --> 04:26:55.420
in a different type of classroom.

04:26:56.380 --> 04:26:59.580
My son is from a multi-ethnic background.

04:27:00.180 --> 04:27:03.860
He's biracial and we have a very diverse family

04:27:04.420 --> 04:27:06.780
and that diversity has been welcomed and embraced

04:27:06.780 --> 04:27:09.140
at RBC in a way that they've never experienced

04:27:09.140 --> 04:27:11.300
at any other school with our children

04:27:11.300 --> 04:27:13.820
including with my older child who is now

04:27:13.820 --> 04:27:15.020
a freshman in college.

04:27:16.100 --> 04:27:19.460
The focus on social emotional skills has been key for my son.

04:27:19.980 --> 04:27:23.020
This was never something that I'd seen in either

04:27:23.020 --> 04:27:25.180
of my children's academic experience

04:27:25.180 --> 04:27:27.260
and it is very very important for him.

04:27:29.260 --> 04:27:30.780
Thank you caller. Your time is up.

04:27:36.580 --> 04:27:38.660
Caller please state your name and affiliation

04:27:38.660 --> 04:27:40.620
for the record. You have one minute.

04:27:40.620 --> 04:27:41.740
Your time begins now.

04:27:45.220 --> 04:27:47.220
Hi my name is Natalie Long.

04:27:47.220 --> 04:27:50.820
I'm a parent of two blossoming boys at RBC.

04:27:50.860 --> 04:27:53.940
I wholeheartedly believe in public schools

04:27:54.660 --> 04:27:57.820
and I believe that the traditional post-industrial

04:27:57.820 --> 04:28:00.180
era system needs some serious disruption.

04:28:00.180 --> 04:28:02.780
Kids are being forced to perform for the test.

04:28:02.780 --> 04:28:04.820
They're stressed out anxious and depressed

04:28:05.380 --> 04:28:07.660
and many neurodiverse students are shamed

04:28:07.660 --> 04:28:09.740
for being different instead of celebrated

04:28:09.740 --> 04:28:11.020
for their unique strengths.

04:28:11.580 --> 04:28:14.420
I chose RBC for its inquiry based approach

04:28:14.420 --> 04:28:16.540
and for being the only public elementary school

04:28:16.540 --> 04:28:19.180
that had this child led approach inclusive

04:28:19.180 --> 04:28:22.740
special ed and diverse lived lived experiences.

04:28:23.260 --> 04:28:25.300
When I met with my local elementary school

04:28:25.300 --> 04:28:28.420
principal she said I wish we could do that.

04:28:28.420 --> 04:28:30.020
My hands are so tied.

04:28:30.860 --> 04:28:33.260
I believe to create lifelong learners in a world

04:28:33.260 --> 04:28:35.220
where we have no idea what the future holds

04:28:35.220 --> 04:28:37.140
we need to move the public system to more

04:28:37.140 --> 04:28:38.620
of an inquiry based approach.

04:28:38.620 --> 04:28:41.500
I wish the Ross Valley School District would take more

04:28:41.500 --> 04:28:44.180
of a partnership approach with us and use us

04:28:44.180 --> 04:28:46.660
as an experiment to bring more child led

04:28:46.660 --> 04:28:47.860
and curiosity fueled.

04:28:48.660 --> 04:28:50.380
Thank you caller. Your time is up.

04:28:53.420 --> 04:28:55.500
Caller please state your name and affiliation

04:28:55.500 --> 04:28:57.860
for the record. You have one minute.

04:28:57.860 --> 04:29:02.620
Your time begins now. My name is Julie Quater.

04:29:02.620 --> 04:29:05.460
I'm a Ross Valley area resident

04:29:05.460 --> 04:29:07.780
who strongly supports the charter.

04:29:07.780 --> 04:29:09.940
RBC is a school that provides effective

04:29:09.940 --> 04:29:12.460
and innovative education to a wide diversity

04:29:12.460 --> 04:29:15.460
of students that your own state expert

04:29:15.500 --> 04:29:19.060
confirmed is operating with fiscal health and stability.

04:29:19.660 --> 04:29:23.140
I hope you will allow them to continue their important work

04:29:23.140 --> 04:29:25.620
in educating those wide range of students

04:29:25.620 --> 04:29:28.420
as they also serve their families. Thank you so much.

04:29:36.140 --> 04:29:37.380
Caller please state your name

You have one minute. Your time begins now.

04:29:42.220 --> 04:29:45.540
My name is Justin Taplin.

04:29:45.540 --> 04:29:47.660
I'm a local community resident.

04:29:48.420 --> 04:29:51.180
I'm phoning to ask that the SBE uphold the decision

04:29:51.180 --> 04:29:52.620
by the Ross Valley School District

04:29:53.540 --> 04:29:56.860
and the intent of AB 1505 and deny the renewal

04:29:56.860 --> 04:29:58.460
of this charter.

04:29:58.460 --> 04:30:00.100
I'd ask you to base that decision

04:30:00.100 --> 04:30:02.900
on the overwhelming evidence and data

04:30:02.900 --> 04:30:04.580
that's been presented by the district

04:30:04.580 --> 04:30:06.460
as well as other outside experts

04:30:06.460 --> 04:30:09.660
and not on emotional appeals and anecdotes

04:30:09.660 --> 04:30:10.900
that you're hearing.

04:30:10.900 --> 04:30:12.420
This is an important decision

04:30:12.420 --> 04:30:14.260
and it has to be based on evidence

04:30:14.260 --> 04:30:18.580
especially evidence showing that when you disaggregate

04:30:18.580 --> 04:30:22.740
the data for academic performance RBC

04:30:22.740 --> 04:30:25.700
is not meeting the needs of its most at risk students.

04:30:27.180 --> 04:30:28.940
The district has spent years trying to work

04:30:28.940 --> 04:30:32.220
with RBC leadership who have proven that they're

04:30:32.220 --> 04:30:36.140
that they have severe financial and government issues.

04:30:37.140 --> 04:30:40.260
Many of which have been outlined in detail

04:30:40.260 --> 04:30:42.780
with supporting evidence here today.

04:30:42.780 --> 04:30:45.180
Please uphold the intent of AB.

04:30:45.180 --> 04:30:46.940
Thank you caller. Your time is up.

04:30:49.740 --> 04:30:51.020
Caller please state your name

04:30:51.020 --> 04:30:52.620
and affiliation for the record.

04:30:52.620 --> 04:30:55.060
You have one minute. Your time begins now.

04:31:01.660 --> 04:31:02.500
Oh, hello. I'm sorry.

04:31:02.500 --> 04:31:04.060
My name is Kimberly Hicks.

04:31:04.060 --> 04:31:06.180
I'm a parent at RBC.

04:31:06.180 --> 04:31:08.500
We chose RBC because of its emphasis

04:31:08.500 --> 04:31:10.380
on inclusion in schools.

04:31:10.380 --> 04:31:13.300
Specifically RBC passed a policy two years ago

04:31:13.300 --> 04:31:15.220
to better support transgender

04:31:15.220 --> 04:31:17.340
and gender nonconforming students.

04:31:17.340 --> 04:31:19.620
The policy allows for students and their families

04:31:19.620 --> 04:31:21.980
to develop a personalized support plan

04:31:21.980 --> 04:31:24.580
rather than relying on generalized protection.

04:31:24.580 --> 04:31:27.220
I can say that this policy has made a world of difference

04:31:27.220 --> 04:31:30.020
for our child who feels supported and protected

04:31:30.020 --> 04:31:31.460
by staff and the community

04:31:31.500 --> 04:31:34.900
to express herself authentically.

04:31:34.900 --> 04:31:37.020
We have been able to advocate for her further

04:31:37.020 --> 04:31:38.740
through Ross Valley Charter's Diversity

04:31:38.740 --> 04:31:39.820
and Inclusion Committee,

04:31:39.820 --> 04:31:41.740
which is an active school community

04:31:41.740 --> 04:31:43.740
of caregivers and educators.

04:31:43.740 --> 04:31:45.780
And we're dedicated to amplifying the voices

04:31:45.780 --> 04:31:48.300
of those who are traditionally underserved.

04:31:48.300 --> 04:31:50.420
I strongly support this school.

04:31:50.420 --> 04:31:51.260
Thank you.

04:31:57.780 --> 04:31:59.100
Caller please state your name

04:31:59.100 --> 04:32:00.740

04:32:00.740 --> 04:32:02.460
You have one moment.

04:32:02.460 --> 04:32:03.700
Your time begins now.

04:32:07.420 --> 04:32:08.260
Hi there.

04:32:08.260 --> 04:32:09.420
My name is Steven Ledine.

04:32:09.420 --> 04:32:12.420
I strongly support the state approving

04:32:12.420 --> 04:32:15.100
the renewal of Ross Valley Charter.

04:32:15.100 --> 04:32:16.500
I had two children attend

04:32:16.500 --> 04:32:18.940
and they really benefited from the program.

04:32:18.940 --> 04:32:22.780
My oldest joined with significant reading challenges.

04:32:22.780 --> 04:32:24.980
And when she graduated, she excelled

04:32:24.980 --> 04:32:26.740
in this unique learning environment

04:32:26.740 --> 04:32:28.180
and the multi-age approach.

04:32:28.180 --> 04:32:30.220
I found the teachers and staff to be excellent

04:32:30.220 --> 04:32:31.540
and well organized.

04:32:31.540 --> 04:32:33.580
I'm a bit stumped by the small

04:32:33.580 --> 04:32:35.020
and well-funded opposition.

04:32:35.020 --> 04:32:37.460
It seems like an emotional struggle for control

04:32:37.460 --> 04:32:39.580
rather than a sincere concern for students

04:32:39.580 --> 04:32:42.340
and improvement in learning as they state.

04:32:42.340 --> 04:32:44.420
RBC is under great scrutiny

04:32:44.420 --> 04:32:46.300
and I've always seen they've kept excellent records

04:32:46.300 --> 04:32:48.540
and reports as a result.

04:32:48.540 --> 04:32:50.820
The CDE's website encourages charters

04:32:50.820 --> 04:32:52.820
to provide vigorous competition

04:32:52.820 --> 04:32:54.780
and develop better learning.

04:32:54.780 --> 04:32:57.060
And I think RBC achieves this very well.

04:32:57.060 --> 04:32:59.660
I hope you'll make your determination based on facts.

04:32:59.660 --> 04:33:00.660
Thank you so much.

04:33:05.340 --> 04:33:06.180
Hello, caller.

04:33:06.180 --> 04:33:08.580
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:33:08.580 --> 04:33:09.540
You have one minute.

04:33:09.540 --> 04:33:10.900
Your time begins now.

04:33:17.180 --> 04:33:18.780
Hello, I am Cheryl Flick,

04:33:18.780 --> 04:33:21.140
parent of two at Ross Valley Charter School

04:33:21.140 --> 04:33:24.100
and I wholeheartedly support the renewal.

04:33:24.100 --> 04:33:25.340
I happen to be an accountant

04:33:25.340 --> 04:33:28.460
and I can attest to there being a conservative approach

04:33:28.460 --> 04:33:30.580
to budgeting and decision-making.

04:33:30.580 --> 04:33:33.260
From startup mode four years ago

04:33:33.260 --> 04:33:35.660
through and including this pandemic,

04:33:35.660 --> 04:33:39.820
the district allegations to the contrary are simply false.

04:33:39.820 --> 04:33:41.740
As a parent, I most love the integration

04:33:41.740 --> 04:33:43.620
of social emotional learning,

04:33:43.620 --> 04:33:48.260
benefiting all kids' engagement with school, including mine.

04:33:48.260 --> 04:33:52.540
And I celebrate the school's radically inclusive focus

04:33:52.540 --> 04:33:56.380
on serving students facing socioeconomic disadvantages,

04:33:56.380 --> 04:33:58.380
students with learning differences,

04:33:59.300 --> 04:34:01.420
and all the various differences of the rainbow.

04:34:01.420 --> 04:34:02.580
Please renew our charter.

04:34:02.580 --> 04:34:03.780
Thank you for your time.

04:34:08.740 --> 04:34:09.860
Hello, caller.

04:34:09.860 --> 04:34:12.420
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:34:12.420 --> 04:34:13.460
You have one minute.

04:34:13.460 --> 04:34:14.700
Your time begins now.

04:34:18.340 --> 04:34:19.500
Hello, this is Eric Premack

04:34:19.500 --> 04:34:21.180
with the Charter Schools Development Center.

04:34:21.180 --> 04:34:23.180
We've worked with the Ross Valley folks

04:34:23.180 --> 04:34:24.540
since the school's inception

04:34:24.580 --> 04:34:27.940
and always found them to be very resourceful,

04:34:27.940 --> 04:34:31.500
competent, and focused on sound financial management.

04:34:31.500 --> 04:34:33.940
We regret the very emotional opposition

04:34:33.940 --> 04:34:35.380
by some at the local level

04:34:35.380 --> 04:34:37.460
and believe it demonstrates the importance

04:34:37.460 --> 04:34:41.100
of having the county and state appeal processes.

04:34:41.100 --> 04:34:44.060
Based on my 30 plus years of in-depth experience

04:34:44.060 --> 04:34:46.300
on school finance at the school district

04:34:46.300 --> 04:34:47.380
and charter school level,

04:34:47.380 --> 04:34:49.980
it's very clear that they're financially well-managed

04:34:49.980 --> 04:34:51.420
and sustainable.

04:34:51.420 --> 04:34:56.420
The debt ratios are normal for schools of this sort

04:34:56.620 --> 04:34:59.740
and we support the CDE staff and its hard work

04:34:59.740 --> 04:35:02.500
and the ACCS recommendation to grant the appeal

04:35:02.500 --> 04:35:04.500
and hope that the board will vote to do so.

04:35:04.500 --> 04:35:05.340
Thank you.

04:35:10.180 --> 04:35:11.060
Hello, caller.

04:35:11.060 --> 04:35:13.540
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:35:13.540 --> 04:35:14.620
You have one minute.

04:35:14.620 --> 04:35:15.980
Your time begins now.

04:35:15.980 --> 04:35:17.460
Hello, my name is Lisa Cana

04:35:17.460 --> 04:35:19.420
and I'm an active public education volunteer

04:35:19.420 --> 04:35:20.820
across multiple school districts

04:35:20.820 --> 04:35:23.260
and I'm a resident in the Ross Valley School District

04:35:23.260 --> 04:35:25.460
with no personal connection to RBC.

04:35:25.460 --> 04:35:26.940
Marin County with fewer students

04:35:26.940 --> 04:35:28.860
than neighboring counties consolidated districts

04:35:28.860 --> 04:35:31.620
has 17 distinct school districts,

04:35:31.620 --> 04:35:34.020
most of which have extremely regressive restrictions

04:35:34.020 --> 04:35:35.620
on inter-district transfers.

04:35:35.620 --> 04:35:37.420
We have segregation by zip code.

04:35:37.420 --> 04:35:39.860
MCOE provides local control authority

04:35:39.860 --> 04:35:41.380
with locally elected officials

04:35:41.380 --> 04:35:42.980
and local government officials

04:35:42.980 --> 04:35:44.300
to help with the process.

04:35:44.540 --> 04:35:47.140
We have a special authority with locally elected officials

04:35:47.140 --> 04:35:48.580
who can enable students to break through

04:35:48.580 --> 04:35:50.340
these artificial obstacles.

04:35:50.340 --> 04:35:52.740
RBC is one of the very few local public options.

04:35:52.740 --> 04:35:54.540
Families with English language learners

04:35:54.540 --> 04:35:56.260
and those lacking financial freedom

04:35:56.260 --> 04:35:58.980
to defy geographic barriers and exert choice

04:35:58.980 --> 04:36:01.460
to break down the artificial barriers to integration

04:36:01.460 --> 04:36:02.940
presented by zip code.

04:36:02.940 --> 04:36:05.140
Standardized assessments don't measure belonging

04:36:05.140 --> 04:36:06.540
and inclusion, they should.

04:36:06.540 --> 04:36:08.380
When families opt in, they vote with their feet

04:36:08.380 --> 04:36:10.020
to demonstrate where they feel their children

04:36:10.020 --> 04:36:10.860
are best served.

04:36:10.860 --> 04:36:13.060
This program, having grown out of a district program

04:36:13.060 --> 04:36:16.980
of diversity and hostility by its prior oversight body

04:36:16.980 --> 04:36:18.340
and device of attacks,

04:36:18.340 --> 04:36:20.220
hopefully once out from under these challenges

04:36:20.220 --> 04:36:22.220
they can return to focusing on what they.

04:36:23.660 --> 04:36:24.500
Thank you, caller.

04:36:24.500 --> 04:36:25.460
Your time is over.

04:36:27.580 --> 04:36:28.860
Caller, please state your name

04:36:28.860 --> 04:36:30.380
and affiliation for the record.

04:36:30.380 --> 04:36:31.620
You have one minute.

04:36:31.620 --> 04:36:32.860
Your time begins now.

04:36:37.140 --> 04:36:38.860
Hello, my name is Sam Lueck.

04:36:38.860 --> 04:36:41.940
I am a father of two with RBC

04:36:41.940 --> 04:36:45.020
and I appreciate the need for local control

04:36:45.020 --> 04:36:46.380
as been discussed here,

04:36:46.380 --> 04:36:48.500
but I think this is really important.

04:36:48.500 --> 04:36:50.740
This process shows how important it is,

04:36:50.740 --> 04:36:54.460
how vital it is to protect the interests of a local school

04:36:54.460 --> 04:36:59.100
from a hostile school district and a vocal faction.

04:36:59.100 --> 04:37:02.420
The facts and evidence in the CDE process

04:37:02.420 --> 04:37:04.460
recommended approval,

04:37:04.460 --> 04:37:08.020
yet the district and its supporters

04:37:08.020 --> 04:37:10.100
are now attacking the process.

04:37:10.100 --> 04:37:12.420
I think that's representative of their approach

04:37:12.420 --> 04:37:13.420
for the last several years

04:37:13.420 --> 04:37:16.380
and I'm really sorry it's gone this way.

04:37:16.380 --> 04:37:17.580
Thank you for your time.

04:37:23.180 --> 04:37:24.020
Hello, caller.

04:37:24.020 --> 04:37:26.260
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:37:26.260 --> 04:37:27.180
You have one minute.

04:37:27.180 --> 04:37:28.460
Your time begins now.

04:37:37.220 --> 04:37:38.300
Are you there, caller?

04:37:40.340 --> 04:37:42.660
Are you there, caller?

04:37:42.660 --> 04:37:43.660
I'm sorry.

04:37:43.660 --> 04:37:44.980
This is Amy Flynn.

04:37:44.980 --> 04:37:46.020
I'm a Raspberry Valley resident

04:37:46.020 --> 04:37:47.700
who committed physical crime

04:37:47.700 --> 04:37:48.940
in a attempt to rob the painting

04:37:48.940 --> 04:37:50.420
at ER play center.

04:37:51.940 --> 04:37:53.260
I have no hearing.

04:38:01.940 --> 04:38:03.180
No, not at the theater arena.

04:38:03.180 --> 04:38:04.020
At the library.

04:38:04.020 --> 04:38:05.460
Are you there, caller?

04:38:05.460 --> 04:38:06.300
Are you there, caller?

04:38:06.300 --> 04:38:07.460
Are you there, caller?

04:38:07.460 --> 04:38:08.300
Sorry.

04:38:08.300 --> 04:38:09.540
This is Amy Flynn.

04:38:09.540 --> 04:38:11.500
President, good afternoon board.

04:38:11.500 --> 04:38:14.340
I'd like to urge you to deny the renewal of this charter,

04:38:14.340 --> 04:38:15.860
which has never come close to meeting

04:38:15.860 --> 04:38:17.540
their stated enrollment numbers,

04:38:17.540 --> 04:38:19.420
which has had shady financial dealings

04:38:19.420 --> 04:38:23.020
and has admired in debt since its inception,

04:38:23.020 --> 04:38:24.940
which has had very questionable governance

04:38:24.940 --> 04:38:27.820
since its inception, and which was denied not once,

04:38:27.820 --> 04:38:31.100
but twice by our locally elected school board

04:38:31.100 --> 04:38:33.820
and our locally elected county officials.

04:38:33.820 --> 04:38:37.180
Please return the decision-making back to the local level.

04:38:37.180 --> 04:38:38.000
Thank you.

04:38:39.540 --> 04:38:44.540
Hello, caller.

04:38:44.540 --> 04:38:46.980
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:38:46.980 --> 04:38:48.020
You have one minute.

04:38:48.020 --> 04:38:49.320
Your time begins now.

04:38:55.900 --> 04:38:57.940
Hi, my name is Zach Cortez and I'm a parent.

04:38:57.940 --> 04:39:00.660
I'm an emerging learner here at RBC.

04:39:00.660 --> 04:39:02.060
I spent the first half of my career

04:39:02.060 --> 04:39:04.100
as an educator and advocate for children,

04:39:04.100 --> 04:39:05.780
serving as a California credential teacher

04:39:05.780 --> 04:39:09.060
and administrator with a master's in educational leadership.

04:39:09.060 --> 04:39:11.380
Previously, I'd been skeptical of charter schools'

04:39:11.380 --> 04:39:13.860
true impact, and then I had children.

04:39:13.860 --> 04:39:15.920
Understanding the special needs of my child,

04:39:15.920 --> 04:39:18.760
I knew the widely adopted approaches of public education

04:39:18.760 --> 04:39:21.820
would not support my child's unique learning needs.

04:39:21.820 --> 04:39:25.120
I was thrilled when we learned about the RBC community

04:39:25.120 --> 04:39:28.140
and ecstatic when I actually learned,

04:39:28.140 --> 04:39:31.620
was able to see the education in practice.

04:39:31.620 --> 04:39:34.220
I am asking you to please renew the charter.

04:39:35.940 --> 04:39:36.780
Thank you.

04:39:39.740 --> 04:39:40.940
Hello, caller.

04:39:40.940 --> 04:39:43.540
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:39:43.540 --> 04:39:44.660
You have one minute.

04:39:44.660 --> 04:39:45.860
Your time begins now.

04:39:53.200 --> 04:39:54.440
Good afternoon.

04:39:54.440 --> 04:39:56.260
My name is Vladimir Ivanovich,

04:39:56.260 --> 04:39:58.780
and I'm a trustee of the Los Altos School District.

04:39:58.780 --> 04:40:01.820
And I'm also pursuing a doctorate in education leadership

04:40:01.820 --> 04:40:03.720
at San Jose State University.

04:40:03.720 --> 04:40:07.040
My dissertation topic is equity and charter schools.

04:40:08.040 --> 04:40:10.440
I urge you to, this board,

04:40:10.440 --> 04:40:13.600
to deny Ross Valley Charter School's appeal of a decision

04:40:13.600 --> 04:40:18.360
by the local LEA to deny their renewal petition.

04:40:18.360 --> 04:40:20.560
I think there are procedural, financial,

04:40:20.560 --> 04:40:24.720
and analysis issues should be taken into consideration.

04:40:24.720 --> 04:40:28.280
But for me, there are sufficient and necessary grounds

04:40:28.280 --> 04:40:30.920
for denial of RBC's appeal,

04:40:30.920 --> 04:40:33.680
because of the abysmal performance of RBC

04:40:33.720 --> 04:40:37.200
in closing educational gaps of our most vulnerable groups,

04:40:37.200 --> 04:40:38.560
English language learners,

04:40:38.560 --> 04:40:41.760
low SES, and Latino-Hispanic subgroups.

04:40:41.760 --> 04:40:44.400
RBC does far worse than the district,

04:40:44.400 --> 04:40:47.600
the county, and the state in closing equity gaps,

04:40:47.600 --> 04:40:50.280
and arguably makes the problem worse.

04:40:50.280 --> 04:40:54.960
I direct you to pages 43 to 50 of exhibit E of-

04:40:54.960 --> 04:40:55.800
Thank you, caller.

04:40:55.800 --> 04:40:56.640
Your time is up.

04:40:58.860 --> 04:40:59.700
Hello, caller.

04:40:59.700 --> 04:41:01.920
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:41:01.920 --> 04:41:03.080
You have one minute.

04:41:03.080 --> 04:41:04.340
Your time begins now.

04:41:08.800 --> 04:41:09.640
Good afternoon.

04:41:09.640 --> 04:41:11.680
My name is Maria Quintana Pilling,

04:41:11.680 --> 04:41:13.320
and I am a resident of Ross Valley

04:41:13.320 --> 04:41:15.760
and a parent at Ross Valley Charter.

04:41:15.760 --> 04:41:19.040
I strongly support the renewal of RBC's charter.

04:41:19.040 --> 04:41:22.640
Thank you for taking the time to listen to our community.

04:41:22.640 --> 04:41:24.280
My son is currently in fifth grade

04:41:24.280 --> 04:41:27.280
and has been at RBC since its start,

04:41:27.280 --> 04:41:30.920
and I have watched him blossom into an independent learner.

04:41:30.920 --> 04:41:33.520
One of the reasons I was so interested in the program

04:41:33.520 --> 04:41:36.920
is because the kids remained with the teacher for two years.

04:41:36.920 --> 04:41:38.640
This has been tremendously helpful

04:41:38.640 --> 04:41:41.600
as my son is initially very introverted.

04:41:41.600 --> 04:41:42.920
He is in fifth grade now,

04:41:42.920 --> 04:41:46.080
and I would say that his first, third, and fifth year

04:41:46.080 --> 04:41:47.400
have been his best

04:41:47.400 --> 04:41:49.560
because he was comfortable with the teacher,

04:41:49.560 --> 04:41:53.200
and the teacher understood his strengths and supported him.

04:41:53.200 --> 04:41:55.080
He has embraced taking the leadership role

04:41:55.080 --> 04:41:57.000
in his second year with each teacher,

04:41:57.000 --> 04:41:59.460
and this has done so much to boost his confidence

04:41:59.500 --> 04:42:01.380
and independent thinking.

04:42:01.380 --> 04:42:04.380
Again, I strongly support the renewal of RBC's charter.

04:42:04.380 --> 04:42:05.220
Thank you.

04:42:07.940 --> 04:42:08.940
Thank you, Caller.

04:42:10.460 --> 04:42:11.740
Caller, please state your name

04:42:11.740 --> 04:42:13.460
and affiliation for the record.

04:42:13.460 --> 04:42:14.540
You have one minute.

04:42:14.540 --> 04:42:15.820
Your time begins now.

04:42:21.460 --> 04:42:22.660
Hi, my name is Tanya.

04:42:22.660 --> 04:42:26.420
I'm a parent of a child at Ross Valley Charter,

04:42:26.420 --> 04:42:30.220
and I just want to point out the number of families

04:42:30.220 --> 04:42:33.660
that are calling in and remind everyone

04:42:33.660 --> 04:42:36.540
that while there's politics around all of this,

04:42:36.540 --> 04:42:38.220
there's also a large number of families

04:42:38.220 --> 04:42:41.180
who are very happy there and thriving,

04:42:41.180 --> 04:42:46.140
and to not renew would displace so many children

04:42:46.140 --> 04:42:51.140
and families in a time when the world is already upside down.

04:42:52.460 --> 04:42:55.060
It's been the most diverse school

04:42:55.060 --> 04:42:59.580
and social-emotional, and it's really a great place,

04:42:59.580 --> 04:43:01.580
and I think you should renew.

04:43:01.580 --> 04:43:02.420
Thank you.

04:43:05.860 --> 04:43:06.780
Thank you, Caller.

04:43:08.820 --> 04:43:10.020
Caller, please state your name

04:43:10.020 --> 04:43:11.580
and affiliation for the record.

04:43:11.580 --> 04:43:12.660
You have one minute.

04:43:12.660 --> 04:43:13.980
Your time begins now.

04:43:19.420 --> 04:43:23.260
Hello, my name is Emma Riggs, and I'm a parent to RBC,

04:43:23.260 --> 04:43:25.220
and I strongly support the renewal

04:43:25.220 --> 04:43:27.340
of this phenomenal school.

04:43:27.340 --> 04:43:30.140
I have spent a lot of time in the classroom volunteering

04:43:30.140 --> 04:43:33.260
since my daughter began three and a half years ago,

04:43:33.260 --> 04:43:37.060
and I am continually amazed by the level of dedication,

04:43:37.060 --> 04:43:41.180
passion, and positivity of all the teachers and staff.

04:43:41.180 --> 04:43:44.100
My child is thriving here in academic

04:43:44.100 --> 04:43:45.980
and social-emotional development

04:43:45.980 --> 04:43:48.700
because of the level of care and excellence

04:43:48.700 --> 04:43:51.180
that is given to every child.

04:43:51.180 --> 04:43:52.020
Thank you.

04:43:54.260 --> 04:43:55.100
Thank you, Caller.

04:43:56.620 --> 04:43:57.780
Caller, please state your name

04:43:57.780 --> 04:43:59.420
and affiliation for the record.

04:43:59.420 --> 04:44:00.460
You have one minute.

04:44:00.460 --> 04:44:01.780
Your time begins now.

04:44:06.540 --> 04:44:07.860
Hi, my name is Hugh Roberts,

04:44:07.860 --> 04:44:10.940
and I live within the Ross Valley School District boundaries.

04:44:10.940 --> 04:44:12.900
I have two kids.

04:44:12.900 --> 04:44:14.900
Both went to Ross Valley Charter

04:44:14.900 --> 04:44:16.740
for at least part of their school,

04:44:16.740 --> 04:44:19.700
and they benefited greatly from being there.

04:44:19.700 --> 04:44:20.900
The teachers are excellent,

04:44:21.460 --> 04:44:24.420
and the school is a real asset to our community.

04:44:24.420 --> 04:44:26.420
The reasons that the district gave

04:44:26.420 --> 04:44:29.220
for the denial of the charter are not fair,

04:44:29.220 --> 04:44:32.500
do not represent an honest statement of the facts

04:44:32.500 --> 04:44:35.980
as is required by their duty under the law.

04:44:35.980 --> 04:44:37.380
But the district opposes the charter

04:44:37.380 --> 04:44:39.860
not because it is concerned about the RBC students

04:44:39.860 --> 04:44:41.660
or the RBC finances,

04:44:41.660 --> 04:44:44.100
but because it doesn't want parents to have a choice

04:44:44.100 --> 04:44:47.980
on where their kids go or what kind of school they attend.

04:44:47.980 --> 04:44:49.700
Everyone in this district will be better off

04:44:49.740 --> 04:44:52.980
if the district spent our shared resources

04:44:52.980 --> 04:44:54.780
on supporting the students

04:44:54.780 --> 04:44:56.500
instead of trying to shut down a school

04:44:56.500 --> 04:44:59.260
or move a valuable choice to parents in our community.

04:45:00.460 --> 04:45:02.580
These are for the renewal of the charter.

04:45:02.580 --> 04:45:03.420
Thank you.

04:45:04.540 --> 04:45:05.500
Thank you, Caller.

04:45:07.300 --> 04:45:08.540
Caller, please state your name

04:45:08.540 --> 04:45:10.340
and affiliation for the record.

04:45:10.340 --> 04:45:11.380
You have one minute.

04:45:11.380 --> 04:45:12.620
Your time begins now.

04:45:16.660 --> 04:45:18.340
Hi, this is Edward Yates again.

04:45:18.340 --> 04:45:20.900
I appreciate you allowing me to call back in.

04:45:20.900 --> 04:45:24.580
I'll continue my presentation on behalf of Ms. Goldman.

04:45:24.580 --> 04:45:29.580
Other problems that CDE staff has caused in this process

04:45:30.380 --> 04:45:32.340
is that they have possibly violated FERPA

04:45:32.340 --> 04:45:35.060
and civil rights of all the RBC children

04:45:35.060 --> 04:45:38.940
by sending my client unredacted attendance records.

04:45:38.940 --> 04:45:40.900
Those records later conflicted

04:45:40.900 --> 04:45:44.660
with what your CDE, CSD staff relied on

04:45:44.660 --> 04:45:46.060
to make this decision.

04:45:46.060 --> 04:45:48.420
CDE staff has apparently allowed RBC

04:45:48.420 --> 04:45:49.580
and at least one other facility

04:45:49.580 --> 04:45:52.980
to operate in a non-ADA compliant facility

04:45:52.980 --> 04:45:54.500
for at least a year.

04:45:54.500 --> 04:45:57.740
And notably, nobody's brought up the elephant in the room.

04:45:57.740 --> 04:46:00.220
CDE staff failed to do any due diligence

04:46:00.220 --> 04:46:01.700
in the hiring process

04:46:01.700 --> 04:46:04.940
by hiring a failed former charter school CEO

04:46:04.940 --> 04:46:06.420
who is reported in newspapers

04:46:06.420 --> 04:46:09.020
who allegedly have made white supremacist statements.

04:46:09.020 --> 04:46:13.620
This is the expert that CDE, CSD staff relied upon.

04:46:14.620 --> 04:46:16.860
Given this disturbing lack of due care

04:46:16.860 --> 04:46:18.700
and competence by CDE staff.

04:46:20.820 --> 04:46:21.660
Thank you, caller.

04:46:21.660 --> 04:46:22.580
Your time is up.

04:46:26.140 --> 04:46:27.460
Caller, please state your name

04:46:27.460 --> 04:46:29.020
and affiliation for the record.

04:46:29.020 --> 04:46:30.220
You have one minute.

04:46:30.220 --> 04:46:31.460
Your time begins now.

04:46:37.060 --> 04:46:38.580
Hi, my name is Paige Hersey

04:46:38.580 --> 04:46:40.180
and I'm a parent of a kindergartner

04:46:40.180 --> 04:46:41.260
at Mass Valley Charter

04:46:41.300 --> 04:46:44.020
and I've been an educator for over 20 years.

04:46:44.020 --> 04:46:45.500
My comment is simple.

04:46:45.500 --> 04:46:47.980
Not renewing the charter for Ross Valley Charter School

04:46:47.980 --> 04:46:50.020
would have a significant negative impact

04:46:50.020 --> 04:46:52.700
on children, families and our community.

04:46:52.700 --> 04:46:54.580
Ross Valley Charter is a thriving,

04:46:54.580 --> 04:46:56.700
progressive learning environment.

04:46:56.700 --> 04:46:58.060
Even amidst the pandemic,

04:46:58.060 --> 04:47:00.460
my child and our family have found a welcoming

04:47:00.460 --> 04:47:03.460
and innovative school community at RBC.

04:47:03.460 --> 04:47:05.580
The school successfully serves the children

04:47:05.580 --> 04:47:09.060
in our community as evidenced by a number of measures.

04:47:09.060 --> 04:47:12.060
Ross Valley Charter prioritizes equitably serving

04:47:12.060 --> 04:47:13.940
a diverse student population.

04:47:14.940 --> 04:47:17.980
I urge the commission to renew Ross Valley Charter

04:47:17.980 --> 04:47:20.980
school charter to preserve a valuable option

04:47:20.980 --> 04:47:23.580
that positively impacts children, families

04:47:23.580 --> 04:47:25.740
and our community every day.

04:47:25.740 --> 04:47:26.580
Thank you.

04:47:28.220 --> 04:47:29.140
Thank you, caller.

04:47:31.380 --> 04:47:32.740
Caller, please state your name

04:47:32.740 --> 04:47:34.620
and affiliation for the record.

04:47:34.620 --> 04:47:35.860
You have one minute.

04:47:35.860 --> 04:47:37.180
Your time begins now.

04:47:39.060 --> 04:47:39.900
Hello.

04:47:45.820 --> 04:47:48.860
My name is Griff Roberts and I am an RBC graduate.

04:47:49.940 --> 04:47:52.820
I would like to say that at RBC,

04:47:52.820 --> 04:47:54.100
I feel like I learned more

04:47:54.100 --> 04:47:55.900
in a more inclusive environment.

04:47:56.940 --> 04:47:58.700
With the multi-age program,

04:47:58.700 --> 04:48:02.900
I felt like I was more included with the higher age groups,

04:48:04.020 --> 04:48:06.060
even though I only spent two years there.

04:48:07.380 --> 04:48:08.820
During my year in the fourth grader,

04:48:09.540 --> 04:48:12.340
I met many friends in many other grades.

04:48:12.340 --> 04:48:13.580
And in my fifth year,

04:48:14.860 --> 04:48:18.580
I could help fourth graders and I made friends in all grades.

04:48:19.460 --> 04:48:22.740
I talked to people who I may have never talked to

04:48:22.740 --> 04:48:25.540
and learned about one of my favorite hobbies there.

04:48:25.540 --> 04:48:28.900
In those two years, I was mainly taught by one teacher,

04:48:28.900 --> 04:48:32.780
Ms. Nina, who was understanding and knew how to help

04:48:32.780 --> 04:48:36.180
the fourth graders feel at the same level as the fifth graders.

04:48:36.220 --> 04:48:39.300
I still have most of the friends I met at RBC.

04:48:39.300 --> 04:48:42.700
I feel like in RBC's inclusive environment,

04:48:44.060 --> 04:48:48.340
people can help others and it helps stop age barriers.

04:48:49.220 --> 04:48:50.660
I would like...

04:48:50.660 --> 04:48:51.500
Thank you, caller.

04:48:51.500 --> 04:48:52.340
Your time is up.

04:48:56.980 --> 04:48:58.180

Your time begins now.

04:49:07.180 --> 04:49:08.260
Are you there, caller?

04:49:15.260 --> 04:49:16.700
Hello, caller, are you there?

04:49:24.500 --> 04:49:25.700
Caller, please state your name

04:49:25.700 --> 04:49:27.380

04:49:27.380 --> 04:49:28.540

04:49:28.540 --> 04:49:29.900
Your time begins now.

04:49:36.580 --> 04:49:38.940
Yes, hi, this is Peter Karnakin.

04:49:38.940 --> 04:49:41.860
I'm a parent at RBC Charter

04:49:41.860 --> 04:49:44.860
and I grew up going to progressive schools

04:49:44.860 --> 04:49:48.260
and it was very important for me to send my son

04:49:48.260 --> 04:49:50.940
to a place where he could really love learning.

04:49:53.980 --> 04:49:57.340
I think that the attacks on RBC demonstrate

04:49:57.340 --> 04:49:59.460
the amount of hatred and distortion,

04:49:59.460 --> 04:50:03.340
the idea that there would be white supremacists at RBC

04:50:03.340 --> 04:50:06.220
is a radical distortion.

04:50:06.220 --> 04:50:09.860
It is, one could argue about the merits of charter schools

04:50:09.860 --> 04:50:12.140
but to go to such a screen shows

04:50:12.140 --> 04:50:14.260
that the opponents are not thinking clearly.

04:50:14.260 --> 04:50:18.300
I hope you will approve the petition

04:50:18.300 --> 04:50:21.860
and reinstate or keep RBC's charter intact.

04:50:21.860 --> 04:50:22.700
Thank you.

04:50:26.580 --> 04:50:28.220

04:50:33.340 --> 04:50:34.180
Hello.

04:50:39.300 --> 04:50:40.140
Hello.

04:50:44.020 --> 04:50:44.860
Hello.

04:50:56.060 --> 04:50:57.620
Hello, caller, please state your name

04:51:00.300 --> 04:51:01.660
Your time begins now.

04:51:03.340 --> 04:51:13.040
Hello. My name is Susan Lund a Ross Valley resident for over 25 years. RVSD's denial

04:51:13.040 --> 04:51:20.040
is well within the parameters of denial based on AB 1505. After listening to the ACCS meeting

04:51:20.040 --> 04:51:27.800
last month I find it very concerning that the CD CDE is completely ignoring AB 1505

04:51:27.800 --> 04:51:33.360
by overriding the decision of our locally elected school board members to deny RVC's

04:51:33.360 --> 04:51:40.200
renewal. AB 1505 was passed to expand local control by giving increased deference to school

04:51:40.200 --> 04:51:45.080
districts our Ross Valley school district board to determine whether or not to approve

04:51:45.080 --> 04:51:51.380
charter petitions and renewals. Please don't disregard our community or our board by overriding

04:51:51.380 --> 04:51:56.240
our school district. Affirm local control as communities know best how to use their

04:51:56.240 --> 04:52:04.720
public education funds. I urge you to deny RVC's petitions. Thank you for your time.

04:52:04.720 --> 04:52:10.280
Thank you caller. This is a reminder to all callers that there is only one minute per

04:52:10.280 --> 04:52:17.720
caller allowed for this item. Thank you. Caller please state your name and affiliation for

04:52:18.720 --> 04:52:29.720
the record. You have one minute. Your time begins now. Are you there? Hi, good afternoon.

04:52:29.720 --> 04:52:35.720
Hi, good afternoon. My name is Haddad. I'm a parent to a kindergartner. Being first time

04:52:35.720 --> 04:52:40.720
parent it was not easy to find the right school but the multi-age inquiry based curriculum

04:52:40.720 --> 04:52:46.720
of the RVC has made it easier for our family. Having a different background and me not having

04:52:46.720 --> 04:52:52.720
attended school in the U.S. it can be a little confusing what to expect from a school but

04:52:52.720 --> 04:52:58.720
the teacher is very knowledgeable. She is very understanding of different backgrounds

04:52:58.720 --> 04:53:04.720
of the kids. RVC has given my kid different ways to express himself and bring his unique

04:53:04.720 --> 04:53:08.720
creativity into the classroom. Our family has benefited not only from the school but

04:53:08.720 --> 04:53:13.720
from the community of the parents. Not only the staff and teachers which is inclusive

04:53:13.720 --> 04:53:20.720
but also the parent community has been able to, you know, add great value where we felt

04:53:20.720 --> 04:53:26.720
supported and welcomed. I urge that the RVC continues and please approve the renewal.

04:53:26.720 --> 04:53:33.720
Thank you so much. Thank you, caller. Hello, caller. Please state your name and affiliation

04:53:33.720 --> 04:53:42.720
for the record. You have one minute. Your time begins now. Hi, this is Christy Kimball.

04:53:42.720 --> 04:53:47.720
I am a former board member of RVC and a parent of two children who attended RVC. You can tell

04:53:47.720 --> 04:53:52.720
I'm a little emotional about this but I wanted to strongly urge you to approve RVC's

04:53:52.720 --> 04:53:59.720
charter petition. This school is an absolute lifesaver as a much needed free public option

04:53:59.720 --> 04:54:03.720
that allows families whose children are not thriving in the local district schools to find a

04:54:03.720 --> 04:54:08.720
better educational environment for their children. All families deserve choices for their

04:54:08.720 --> 04:54:13.720
children's education, not just wealthy families who can afford private schools. I want to

04:54:13.720 --> 04:54:18.720
emphasize that RVC has a strong track record in delivering strong learning outcomes for its

04:54:18.720 --> 04:54:23.720
students. RVC students have consistently exceeded the performance of the local school district,

04:54:23.720 --> 04:54:28.720
meaning they achieved a higher percentage of students who are proficient and or exceeding

04:54:28.720 --> 04:54:34.720
standards than the district overall as measured by the annual state test in every tested grade

04:54:34.720 --> 04:54:41.720
and subject since the school opened consistently. That's math, ELA, and science.

04:54:41.720 --> 04:54:48.720
Thank you, caller. Your time is up. Caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:54:48.720 --> 04:55:03.720
You have one minute. Your time begins now. Are you there, caller? Yes. This is Christopher

04:55:03.720 --> 04:55:08.720
Walgren, and I just want to say that Ross Valley Charter School has been a fantastic school,

04:55:08.720 --> 04:55:14.720
strongly in favor of renewing the petition. Our daughter is thriving there. I'm somebody that

04:55:14.720 --> 04:55:20.720
grew up in Marin and went to public school on a whole childhood in Marin, and I can say I did not

04:55:20.720 --> 04:55:26.720
necessarily thrive in public school in Marin County, but at this Ross Valley Charter, I'm seeing

04:55:26.720 --> 04:55:35.720
my daughter just blossom. Highly in favor of Ross Valley Charter School. Thank you. Thank you,

04:55:35.720 --> 04:55:43.720
caller. Caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your

04:55:43.720 --> 04:55:52.720
time begins now. Hi, this is Sarah Tewksbury. I live in Ross Valley, and I want to say that I

04:55:52.720 --> 04:55:58.720
watched the ACCS meeting on this topic on February 11th and was extremely disappointed. The behavior

04:55:58.720 --> 04:56:03.720
of the commissioners and the staff was completely unprofessional, and ACCS did not do a thorough

04:56:03.720 --> 04:56:09.720
review by any metric, and FIPMAT is not impartial, and to call it a third party is simply not

04:56:09.720 --> 04:56:14.720
truthful. I urge your organization to not tolerate such blatant incompetence, and please don't

04:56:14.720 --> 04:56:21.720
rubber stamp this. Do a real review on this and all future appeals. Thank you. Thank you, caller.

04:56:21.720 --> 04:56:29.720
Thank you, caller. Caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one

04:56:29.720 --> 04:56:48.720
minute. Your time begins now. Are you there, caller? Caller, please state your name and

04:56:48.720 --> 04:57:07.720
affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time begins now. Hello, caller. Please state

04:57:07.720 --> 04:57:17.720
your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time begins now.

04:57:17.720 --> 04:57:25.720
Hi, my name is Andrea Summits, and I'm a parent of former students who attended RVC. I really,

04:57:25.720 --> 04:57:32.720
really urge and support the renewal of RVC. My children are now, I have three kids who went through

04:57:32.720 --> 04:57:40.720
the multi-age program when it was at Manor School and then RVC, and now my high schooler and also my

04:57:40.720 --> 04:57:48.720
two middle schoolers are, they reflect back on their time in this program, and they wish that something

04:57:48.720 --> 04:57:55.720
was available like this for the middle schoolers in particular. They really felt like it was a nurturing

04:57:55.720 --> 04:58:02.720
environment. It was a family and not just a school. And it really, I saw over and over again how many

04:58:02.720 --> 04:58:09.720
children were, their needs were met in a way in this school because of the way this program is

04:58:09.720 --> 04:58:15.720
designed and because of the multi-age classrooms and the intentional effort to focus on that

04:58:15.720 --> 04:58:24.720
multi-age aspect of this program and the project base. Thank you, caller. Your time is up.

04:58:24.720 --> 04:58:39.720
Caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time begins now.

04:58:39.720 --> 04:58:50.720
Are you there, caller?

04:58:50.720 --> 04:58:57.720
All callers who have called in once appear to have been given the opportunity to speak.

04:58:57.720 --> 04:59:06.720
Thank you. So since there is no other public comment, I'm here by closing the public hearing at

04:59:06.720 --> 04:59:16.720
2.37 p.m. And now we will begin board discussion. First, we're going to ask our liaison,

04:59:16.720 --> 04:59:21.720
Suber and Ting Sung if they would like to make some comments. And then when we move to board discussion,

04:59:21.720 --> 04:59:29.720
just remember to use the raised hand in the participant panel. So I'll start with our liaisons.

04:59:29.720 --> 04:59:36.720
Thank you, Vice President Stroud. So I really want to thank the members of the public who came and

04:59:36.720 --> 04:59:43.720
provided their testimony and public comments today and taking the time to do that. I know that there's

04:59:43.720 --> 04:59:50.720
strong feelings on both sides. But as we consider the appeal, there may be a number of issues that have been

04:59:50.720 --> 04:59:56.720
raised that might have the potential of distracting us from the decision that we need to make regarding the

04:59:56.720 --> 05:00:02.720
future of Ross Valley Charter School. It's extremely important that we focus on the merits of the

05:00:02.720 --> 05:00:08.720
petition and whether the school has met the required renewal criteria. I also want to point out that

05:00:08.720 --> 05:00:17.720
despite claims otherwise, Ross Valley Charter is an SBE authorized charter school and as such must be reviewed

05:00:17.720 --> 05:00:23.720
under a de novo standard, not under an abuse of discretion standard.

05:00:23.720 --> 05:00:35.720
So I just want to associate myself with Ting's remarks as well and just ask board members to focus on the merits

05:00:35.720 --> 05:00:41.720
of the petition and particularly on the findings, I think, of our own staff, the Department of Education staff

05:00:41.720 --> 05:00:49.720
on which we rely, as well as the thoughtful deliberations of our advisory committee on charter schools.

05:00:49.720 --> 05:00:58.720
Because this is our first appeal that we've heard under AB 1505 and to Ting's point about the fact that this was a

05:00:58.720 --> 05:01:06.720
charter authorized by the state board, not by the local board. I was going to ask Judy if she could just say a word

05:01:06.720 --> 05:01:15.720
about the distinction between those two renewal standards and what's really before us. And also just to let people

05:01:15.720 --> 05:01:25.720
know that with respect to the fiscal issues that have been raised, we did ask Mike Fine from the fiscal crisis

05:01:25.720 --> 05:01:33.720
management assistance team on which we rely for all school districts and LEAs throughout the state to take a look at

05:01:33.720 --> 05:01:40.720
some of the issues. And I just wanted to call your attention to the fact that we do have a thoughtful letter from Mike

05:01:40.720 --> 05:01:49.720
about the issue of the debt. And Mike is available if we have any questions. So if I could, Vice President Strauss,

05:01:49.720 --> 05:01:56.720
I see that President Darling-Hammond is back as well, asked Judy just to talk to us a little bit about the distinction

05:01:56.720 --> 05:02:02.720
between the two kinds of reviews under AB 1505. Thank you.

05:02:02.720 --> 05:02:10.720
Yes, Stephanie, this is Judy Sias. As Stephanie said in her presentation and members Sun and Burr have said,

05:02:10.720 --> 05:02:18.720
this is an SB authorized charter school. Ross Valley has been a SB authorized charter school for the last four and a half years.

05:02:18.720 --> 05:02:26.720
As such, the state board is the chartering authority and we have delegated oversight to the CDE as we do for all state board

05:02:26.720 --> 05:02:37.720
authorized charter schools. AB 1505 did change the standard of review for new charter schools and also for renewal of charter

05:02:37.720 --> 05:02:47.720
schools for most to an abusive discretion standard, as member Burr and member Sun said. That means there is a reliance on the

05:02:47.720 --> 05:02:56.720
findings of the district and those findings can only be overturned if the board makes a finding that they had the lower board

05:02:56.720 --> 05:03:04.720
had somehow abused their discretion. However, there is the carve out specifically for state board authorized charter schools

05:03:04.720 --> 05:03:12.720
that before those charter schools that are coming on renewal, the law is the same as it was pre AB 1505.

05:03:12.720 --> 05:03:22.720
And education code 47605.9 states that in those cases for SB authorized charter schools for their first renewal, like this one,

05:03:22.720 --> 05:03:30.720
the board shall apply the law as it read prior to AB 1505 when making their findings. That means that today,

05:03:30.720 --> 05:03:38.720
that means that's a de novo standard of review, as Stephanie and member Sun member Burr have said. Now, there were some elements of 1505

05:03:38.720 --> 05:03:46.720
that were brought into CDE's review, the renewal criteria, for example, the look at verified data, the CAS data, which is on the verified data

05:03:46.720 --> 05:03:54.720
list that the board adopted back in November. However, the standard of review is de novo. That means it's an independent judgment and

05:03:54.720 --> 05:04:02.720
it's not going to be the same findings just like the renewals that you had seen in the past. This is not this is the first first one under AB 1505

05:04:02.720 --> 05:04:12.720
but it is not going to be the views of discretion appeal. You likely won't have one of those until July. Thank you.

05:04:12.720 --> 05:04:21.720
Thank you, Judy. I really appreciate the clarification. So we're going to go to board member discussion now and I'll ask you to raise your hand

05:04:21.720 --> 05:04:31.720
and I see several. So I'm going to call on member Rucker, please. It's your turn and you can start the discussion.

05:04:31.720 --> 05:04:41.720
Thank you very much, board member Strass. I have three questions, but I'll ask them one at a time so that I can leave room for others to ask their questions.

05:04:42.720 --> 05:04:52.720
And you can come back to me for a second and then the third round. The three questions I have are about the finances because I am confused about the two different numbers.

05:04:52.720 --> 05:05:04.720
The second question is about the enrollment and my final question is about the English learner and the English learner information and the condition that was added to the renewal.

05:05:04.720 --> 05:05:14.720
So I will start with the English learner question. We are spending a lot of time not only talking about English learners and the performance gap, but also in a separate item.

05:05:14.720 --> 05:05:24.720
We talked about the state literacy plan and the consideration about the development of supports and important support within the programs for English learners.

05:05:24.720 --> 05:05:40.720
So I'm not really clear how the condition alone actually will correct or address what was identified as an actual weakness with the English learner program description that the CDE actually called out.

05:05:40.720 --> 05:05:50.720
So Stephanie, my questions related to this are what exactly, I understand the county office is going to be responsible for doing the monitoring on this.

05:05:50.720 --> 05:06:06.720
The only thing you have asked them for is to add some simple statements to the plan, but this does not actually clarify the protections that need to be addressed in their instructional program and how that will shore up the required supports for English learners.

05:06:06.720 --> 05:06:10.720
Could you clarify that for me?

05:06:10.720 --> 05:06:18.720
Yes, you are kind of cutting out a little bit, so I'm hoping that I got the gist of your question.

05:06:18.720 --> 05:06:26.720
So we have had oversight of this school for five years. They are making tremendous progress with their English learners.

05:06:26.720 --> 05:06:39.720
We feel that their program is a strong program, even during the distance learning that most schools have been going through.

05:06:39.720 --> 05:06:47.720
They made extra efforts to meet one on one with their EL students, so they have a strong program.

05:06:47.720 --> 05:07:10.720
I would say that the conditions that we've asked for in terms of strengthening the language in their petition really are, so it's clear that those three areas that we had listed, clarification around the home language survey,

05:07:10.720 --> 05:07:30.720
the requirement for proficiency is a score of four, and the updated descriptions seem to be maybe just an oversight and not putting in what they probably should have in their petition, but doesn't really reflect the program they have.

05:07:30.720 --> 05:07:45.720
Because we've seen the work, and our oversight consultants have worked with them over the last four and a half years, so we've seen the work they've put in with their ELs, which I think is reflected in those huge growth rates for EL both in English language arts and math.

05:07:45.720 --> 05:08:04.720
And so we also, just so you know, and we do this for all of our appeals, we send the petition to our EL division and our special ed division within the department to look at their program and the language they have in the petition.

05:08:04.720 --> 05:08:22.720
So, you know, we do turn to our experts to make sure that if there's some sort of lack of clarity in the petition, it's not actually a lack of clarity in their actual program and what they're doing with students in schools.

05:08:22.720 --> 05:08:38.720
So I think, you know, we felt pretty comfortable having been the oversight agency and having worked with them, and our oversight consultants work with the schools pretty closely, that they do have a really strong program there.

05:08:38.720 --> 05:08:46.720
And as I said, our EL division also looked at it and felt that they had a strong program as well.

05:08:46.720 --> 05:08:56.720
Okay, and as I said, I have two more questions, but I will wait for a couple of other folks to ask questions and you can come back to me board members.

05:08:56.720 --> 05:09:08.720
So, Member Rucker, stay with us. I just want to make one comment because we don't have any other hands. This is a time for board member discussion and deliberation, so board members can raise their hands and we'll call on you.

05:09:08.720 --> 05:09:17.720
If we need clarification from district representatives or charter representatives, then we will call on you to clarify, but this is the time for board member discussion.

05:09:17.720 --> 05:09:21.720
So, Member Rucker, go ahead and continue with your other two questions.

05:09:21.720 --> 05:09:31.720
Okay, thank you. My second question is for the charter itself and it concerns the ethnic minority enrollment information.

05:09:31.720 --> 05:09:44.720
I am always sensitive to the way information is presented about percentages and enrollment and actual numbers of students, particularly when it comes to students of color.

05:09:44.720 --> 05:09:56.720
And when this charter was created, the promise was that it was being created to create choice and to create diversity in a very broadly diverse student population.

05:09:56.720 --> 05:10:03.720
So, in seeing your numbers, you presented a lot of information about the percentages and you said that 1% of your students are African-American.

05:10:03.720 --> 05:10:17.720
So, I'd like you to tell me what the actual numbers are. How many students are enrolled in your school? How many are Hispanic? How many are African-American and what the other ethnic demographics of your school site are?

05:10:18.720 --> 05:10:30.720
Hi, this is Luke DeShane, Director of Ross Valley Charter. If you can give me a moment to get those exact numbers for you, I can come back with those. I just have the percentages in front of me right now.

05:10:30.720 --> 05:10:42.720
That's fine. And when you do that, because this was something that was a part of the foundational goals, I'm sorry if you're hearing pounding in the background. I have repairmen at my house.

05:10:42.720 --> 05:10:48.720
I've been trying to keep that quiet and ask my questions when they're not in the house. So, I apologize for that.

05:10:48.720 --> 05:11:01.720
The second question I have related to that is what were your enrollment numbers in your first year and what is the difference between the enrollment numbers you have right now and the enrollment in your first year?

05:11:01.720 --> 05:11:13.720
So, I can say just overall, our enrollment at the beginning of our first year was 122 kids total and we're at 204 kids total now.

05:11:13.720 --> 05:11:18.720
And what was the ethnic distribution of that in your first year?

05:11:18.720 --> 05:11:27.720
It was slightly less than it is now. It has improved over time. Again, I don't have those numbers exactly right in front of me, but I will work on pulling those up for you.

05:11:27.720 --> 05:11:40.720
Okay, you can come back to me on that and I can go. I'll ask my third question. That's for our FICMAP person and I can come back to you if you don't mind that Board Member Strauss to give them enough time to get that data together.

05:11:40.720 --> 05:11:46.720
That was in the, I believe that was in the slide, Member Rucker, as well.

05:11:46.720 --> 05:11:51.720
Yeah, I'm having a hard time pulling it up, so that's why I decided to ask for that assist study information.

05:11:52.720 --> 05:12:09.720
So, my third question was about the discrepancy or the difference between the numbers reported by the Board about what the obligations are of the charter and the numbers that were reported by the charter.

05:12:09.720 --> 05:12:30.720
And so, Michael, I'd like to ask you to explain to me, are the reasons why they're reporting such a broad difference in what the obligations are is because they didn't look at the same things or the Board considered other things as obligations that the charter did not have to report as an obligation.

05:12:30.720 --> 05:12:40.720
I'm not understanding million dollars in obligation versus a six-figure sum of obligations. I don't understand how that big difference could be.

05:12:43.720 --> 05:12:51.720
Thank you for your question, Member Rucker, and good afternoon, President Linda Darling-Hammond and members of the Board. My pleasure to be with you today.

05:12:52.720 --> 05:13:14.720
Most of you are familiar with FICMAT and our work, but let me provide some clarity first before I answer this specific question. First, we are an independent state agency. We aren't part of CDE, so some concern about our independence. We don't report to the CDE or the state superintendent.

05:13:15.720 --> 05:13:42.720
That's not the structure of our organization. We were asked a specific question about the debt levels here, and that's the only piece of the finances that we looked at. And, Member Rucker, to your point, what we started with was their last published independent audit as our starting point because that audit was accepted by the controller's office and believed it had every reason to believe that it's accurate and complete.

05:13:42.720 --> 05:14:02.720
And then we worked through the course of this current fiscal year. So that last audit was as of June 30th of 2020. We started with those numbers, what was identified both as current liabilities and long-term liabilities, and that's a distinction that's probably not important to you, but is a distinction that's important in the reporting.

05:14:02.720 --> 05:14:24.720
And then we ascertained the status of each of those and asked the charter school to disclose to us any new debt or anticipated debt that may be incurred in the near term. And we have validated each of those pieces, including with the third-party creditors in most cases.

05:14:24.720 --> 05:14:51.720
So I can't explain to you how somebody got to a million dollars. I could look at the data and disregard those portions that have been paid off or forgiven. And if I disregarded that, I could get you into the $800,000 range, but I can't get you to somebody what I think has happened to somebody rounding off to a million dollars, and that's not the case.

05:14:51.720 --> 05:15:11.720
Their debt on July 1st, the beginning of the fiscal year, was $432,000. All of that debt that is represented in that $432,000 has either been forgiven, paid off, or will be paid off by June 30th of 2021.

05:15:11.720 --> 05:15:25.720
They've incurred additional debt during the year, one for construction loan of $355,000, which has monthly payments. So while it may have started at one level, it has gone both up and down based on additional draws of the debt.

05:15:25.720 --> 05:15:47.720
So as construction proceeded, they drew additional funding out against their total approved funding. And then there is anticipated debt in June that is directly related to the state-imposed apportionment deferrals on school districts and charters, of which they will be impacted.

05:15:47.720 --> 05:16:03.720
That anticipated debt, we've picked a number and just stuck with it, although I think you all appreciate this is a year full of change and daily revision, not only in our operations, but in school districts' finances.

05:16:03.720 --> 05:16:32.720
So what we would anticipate, they may draw down in June to deal with state apportionment deferrals today, will be altered based on ESSER II, the December federal pandemic relief aid, the ESSER III, the most recent Biden, President Biden initiative, stimulus and pandemic relief, and then AB 86, all of which have transpired.

05:16:32.720 --> 05:16:50.720
In the period of time in which we've kind of looked at the district. And so those have an influence on what their cash position would be in June and therefore how much short-term cash they need to borrow to mitigate the deferrals.

05:16:50.720 --> 05:16:58.720
All that said, what we're anticipating is they'll have debt at the end of the year of $613,000, all of which is new this year.

05:16:58.720 --> 05:17:07.720
So certainly if you added those two numbers together and they're not additive, you could get to a million. It would make no sense to add those two numbers together, ones at the beginning of the year, ones at the end of the year.

05:17:07.720 --> 05:17:19.720
So member Rucker, the chart that's in our letter, and I can review it verbally, is where we have assessed that they are on March 10th.

05:17:19.720 --> 05:17:44.720
We were asked to look at this on March 2nd. And so we took a look at as current data as we could. That is updated from first interim and should be reflected in their second interim data, which were, of course, due earlier this week to CDE as their oversight into the county superintendent.

05:17:44.720 --> 05:18:00.720
Thank you. Thank you very much for your explanation. I do appreciate that. And then I'll go back to RBC. Have you been able to give me, can you give me the answer to the ethnicity question that I asked you?

05:18:00.720 --> 05:18:29.720
Yes, I can. So in 2017, we had 26 Hispanic or Latino, which is about 20%, 20.6%. Two African, two American Indian or Alaska Native, 10 Asian, zero Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, three black or African American, 83 white, one who identified two or more races, and one unknown.

05:18:29.720 --> 05:18:44.720
One unknown or declined to state. As far as where we are currently, we're at 56 Hispanic or Latino, which is over, which is a 27.5%.

05:18:44.720 --> 05:19:09.720
Five American Indian or Alaska Native, five Asian, which is half of where we were four years ago, zero Native American or other Pacific Islander, six black or African American, which is double, and 18 two or more races, which is 19 more or 17 more students than before, and then six unknown or declined to state.

05:19:09.720 --> 05:19:12.720
Thank you. Thank you very much.

05:19:12.720 --> 05:19:14.720
You're welcome.

05:19:14.720 --> 05:19:30.720
So, thank you, Member Rucker for those clarifying questions. I'm looking to see if there are any other board. I don't see any more hands raised. I'm just double. Oh, I see one. Member Navo.

05:19:30.720 --> 05:19:55.720
I have a couple of questions. I'm really struggling with the perspective differences that CDE has with the district about how to look at the comparative data and fiscal implications. I think I'm starting to wrap my head around it a bit, so I appreciate the questions Board Member Rucker's asked, which gave me a belief that I do understand where these differences are coming from.

05:19:55.720 --> 05:20:09.720
For Stephanie, CDE, the middle track for this school, the only reason, if I understand what I'm reading correctly, the only reason it's in the middle track is because of one metric. Is that correct?

05:20:09.720 --> 05:20:11.720
It is.

05:20:11.720 --> 05:20:22.720
Okay, it is the suspension or the absenteeism. I can't remember which one right now, but yes, it's one of those metrics. Otherwise, they would have been placed in the high track.

05:20:22.720 --> 05:20:28.720
And it would have never been reviewed in the high track.

05:20:28.720 --> 05:20:39.720
Yeah, we would still do a full review, but there are different review criteria under each performance criteria.

05:20:39.720 --> 05:20:56.720
So the only thing that brings it really into the middle track is the one metric. Yes. And in the five years, have we done, has CDE done its due diligence and oversight visits, audits, feedback with the school around corrections?

05:20:56.720 --> 05:21:07.720
Absolutely. We do site visits every year. Obviously, this year we couldn't because we're all remote. So we did a desk audit, which was pretty thorough and comprehensive.

05:21:07.720 --> 05:21:23.720
And we meet with the school once a month through phone calls, and we have done our oversight. And every year, all the state board authorized schools, we put out a memo.

05:21:23.720 --> 05:21:32.720
I believe it's, and Judy might correct me, but I think it's in October where we have academic and fiscal memos for all of the SBE authorized schools.

05:21:32.720 --> 05:21:41.720
So every year the board has been able to see where the school is, along with all the other SBE authorized schools in terms of their academics and fiscal.

05:21:41.720 --> 05:21:46.720
We've never had any corrective actions with the school.

05:21:46.720 --> 05:21:51.720
Okay, thank you. I'll pause there, Board President Hammond.

05:21:51.720 --> 05:21:57.720
Member Darling Hammond?

05:21:57.720 --> 05:22:00.720
You're still muted.

05:22:00.720 --> 05:22:18.720
Thanks. Well, I appreciate the questions about the finances because that was one of the questions, but I think the other part of the conversation has been about the quality of the education and indicators there are generally positive.

05:22:18.720 --> 05:22:39.720
We heard a lot of parents and former parents and even students talk about the fact that it's an environment in which they feel there's a lot of inclusion, that diversity, racial, ethnic, gender orientation, learner diversity, and learning style diversity is supported.

05:22:39.720 --> 05:22:47.720
And so I think that that means a lot. That's the purpose, the primary purpose of choice in our system.

05:22:47.720 --> 05:22:55.720
I would note I was looking up the demographics for the district as we were looking at the demographics for the school.

05:22:55.720 --> 05:23:02.720
The school appears to be about maybe just a little under 50% students of color.

05:23:02.720 --> 05:23:05.720
The district is less than one fourth students of color.

05:23:05.720 --> 05:23:28.720
So the school has attracted a greater range of diversity, but also diversity of all kinds, I think, to its program, which is one that is all TH grouping is unusual in many places, and it's what families that are in this school are looking for.

05:23:28.720 --> 05:23:41.720
So on those grounds and on the grounds of the academic strengths that we've seen, I would be prepared to move acceptance of the CDE motion.

05:23:41.720 --> 05:23:44.720
Do we have a second?

05:23:44.720 --> 05:23:47.720
I will second.

05:23:47.720 --> 05:23:56.720
Okay, so Executive Director Brooks, Alan, will you please call the roll?

05:23:56.720 --> 05:24:02.720
Yes, Member Sun.

05:24:02.720 --> 05:24:06.720
Aye.

05:24:06.720 --> 05:24:08.720
Vice President Strauss.

05:24:08.720 --> 05:24:09.720
Yes.

05:24:09.720 --> 05:24:17.720
Member Rucker.

05:24:17.720 --> 05:24:19.720
No.

05:24:19.720 --> 05:24:22.720
Member Rodriguez.

05:24:22.720 --> 05:24:23.720
Yes.

05:24:23.720 --> 05:24:26.720
Member Petillo-Brownson.

05:24:26.720 --> 05:24:27.720
Yes.

05:24:27.720 --> 05:24:30.720
Member Navo.

05:24:30.720 --> 05:24:31.720
Yes.

05:24:31.720 --> 05:24:33.720
Member McQuillan.

05:24:33.720 --> 05:24:35.720
Yes.

05:24:35.720 --> 05:24:37.720
Member Glover-Woods.

05:24:37.720 --> 05:24:39.720
Yes.

05:24:39.720 --> 05:24:41.720
Member Fatah.

05:24:41.720 --> 05:24:42.720
Yes.

05:24:42.720 --> 05:24:44.720
President Darling-Hammond.

05:24:44.720 --> 05:24:46.720
Yes.

05:24:46.720 --> 05:24:47.720
Member Burr.

05:24:47.720 --> 05:24:49.720
Aye.

05:24:49.720 --> 05:24:52.720
The motion carries.

05:24:52.720 --> 05:24:55.720
So Stephanie, thank you very much.

05:24:55.720 --> 05:25:01.720
Thank you for all the callers and the testimony and for all the people who participated in this item.

05:25:01.720 --> 05:25:10.720
So I just want to announce that we are going to go into closed session this afternoon to hear the case of Kapin versus CDE versus State Board.

05:25:10.720 --> 05:25:15.720
We are going to continue the meeting tomorrow morning at 830.

05:25:15.720 --> 05:25:24.720
I want to thank the public and let the board know that you should disconnect and look for the link if you don't have it.

05:25:24.720 --> 05:25:27.720
There's a separate link for the closed session.

05:25:27.720 --> 05:25:35.720
We're going to take a 10 minute break and we'll come back at 315 in closed session.

05:25:35.720 --> 05:25:37.720
Thank you.

05:25:37.720 --> 05:25:39.720
Thank you and thanks for chairing.

05:25:45.720 --> 05:25:47.720
Thank you.
