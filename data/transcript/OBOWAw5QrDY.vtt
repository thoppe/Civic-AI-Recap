WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.760
Good morning.

00:08.760 --> 00:12.840
Seeing that the board members are now present, Brooks, will you please call the roll to establish

00:12.840 --> 00:13.840
a quorum?

00:13.840 --> 00:15.280
Good morning.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.280
President Darlin-Hammond.

00:16.280 --> 00:17.280

00:17.280 --> 00:18.280
Member Escobedo.

00:18.280 --> 00:19.280
Here.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.280
Vice President Glover-Woods.

00:20.280 --> 00:21.280
Here.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.280
Member Lewis.

00:22.280 --> 00:23.280
Here.

00:24.280 --> 00:25.280
Member McQuillan.

00:25.280 --> 00:26.280
Here.

00:26.280 --> 00:27.280
Member Olken.

00:27.280 --> 00:28.280
Here.

00:28.280 --> 00:29.280
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.280
Here.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.280
Member Petillo-Brownson.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.280
Here.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.280
Member Porter.

00:33.280 --> 00:34.280
Here.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.280
Member Rodriguez.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.280
Here.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.280
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

00:37.280 --> 00:38.280
Here.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.280
Everyone's present.

00:39.280 --> 00:40.280
All right.

00:40.280 --> 00:41.280
All right.

00:41.280 --> 00:57.760
I hereby call the November 2022 meeting of the State Board of Education to order at

00:57.760 --> 01:02.800
8.36 a.m., and I'd like to commence by saluting the flag.

01:02.800 --> 01:06.480
Member Orozco-Gonzalez, will you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?

01:07.480 --> 01:08.480
Sure.

01:08.480 --> 01:10.480
Please rise for the Pledge.

01:13.480 --> 01:15.480
Put your right hand over your heart.

01:15.480 --> 01:16.480
Ready, begin.

01:16.480 --> 01:22.480
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for

01:22.480 --> 01:28.480
which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.480
Thank you very much.

01:36.480 --> 01:40.480
I'm going to start with our general announcements.

01:40.480 --> 01:44.480
There are five items on the agenda that have addenda.

01:44.480 --> 01:51.480
Item 12, Attachment 5, which is the CASP and LPAC test results.

01:51.480 --> 01:57.480
Item 4, Attachment 3, which is the overview of the Children and Youth Behavioral Health

01:57.480 --> 01:58.480
Initiative.

01:58.480 --> 02:05.480
Item 2, the addendum is the 2023-24 State Board of Education Student Member, recommendation

02:05.480 --> 02:06.480
of three finalists.

02:06.480 --> 02:13.480
Item 3, the addendum is the reports from the 2022 Student Advisory Board on Education.

02:13.480 --> 02:19.480
And item 1, the addendum is the 2022 State Board of Education Screening Committee recommendations

02:19.480 --> 02:24.480
regarding appointments to the Advisory Commission on Charter School, California Practitioners

02:24.480 --> 02:28.480
Advisory Group, and the Instructional Quality Commission.

02:29.480 --> 02:37.480
The proposed waiver consent items today are W1 through W6.

02:37.480 --> 02:42.480
And the proposed regular consent items are items 5 through 9.

02:42.480 --> 02:45.480
There's one public hearing on the agenda.

02:45.480 --> 02:50.480
Item 10, which is the appeal from an action of the Orange County Committee on School District

02:50.480 --> 02:55.480
Organization to approve a petition to transfer territory from the Orange County Unified School

02:55.480 --> 02:59.480
District to the Tustin Unified School District.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.480
There are some changes in the agenda.

03:02.480 --> 03:08.480
We will reopen item 1, State Board Priorities, later this afternoon to take action on the

03:08.480 --> 03:14.480
preliminary report of actions and the draft September 2022 meeting minutes, the State

03:14.480 --> 03:19.480
Board of Education Screening Committee recommendations for appointments to various SBE advisory

03:19.480 --> 03:23.480
committees, and to report on our liaison assignments.

03:23.480 --> 03:27.480
In terms of public input, members of the public wishing to call in for public comment

03:27.480 --> 03:31.480
should view the live stream of the meeting to know at what time public comment will occur

03:31.480 --> 03:33.480
for each item.

03:33.480 --> 03:37.480
Public comment may be provided by dialing the phone number, entering a participant access

03:37.480 --> 03:41.480
code, and then following each of the operator's prompts.

03:41.480 --> 03:45.480
Upon dialing in, callers will be added to a caller queue.

03:45.480 --> 03:49.480
The operator will notify callers when it is their turn to provide public comment.

03:49.480 --> 03:54.480
We will also ask callers to please turn down the speaker volume of their computers if they

03:54.480 --> 03:58.480
are following the live webcast to avoid the echoing effect.

03:58.480 --> 04:02.480
Public comment is limited to one minute for each speaker.

04:02.480 --> 04:07.480
Item 11 is the general public comment item, during which members of the public may provide

04:07.480 --> 04:12.480
comment on matters that are not specifically listed in the Board's agenda.

04:12.480 --> 04:16.480
Board members, please mute your microphones when not speaking, keep your cameras on at

04:16.480 --> 04:20.480
all times except during the scheduled breaks to ensure that we maintain a quorum throughout

04:20.480 --> 04:22.480
today's virtual meeting.

04:22.480 --> 04:26.480
And for each item on the agenda, there will be an opportunity for the Board members to

04:26.480 --> 04:30.480
raise their Zoom hand if they would like to ask a question or make a comment.

04:30.480 --> 04:34.480
So item one is our State Board projects and priorities item.

04:34.480 --> 04:38.480
And I will now turn it over to the State Superintendent to provide his report.

04:38.480 --> 04:42.480
State Superintendent?

04:42.480 --> 04:46.480
We want to shift back to the boardroom.

04:52.480 --> 04:54.480
Is the State Superintendent there?

04:54.480 --> 04:56.480
He is.

04:56.480 --> 04:58.480
We're just repositioning the cameras.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.480
Okay.

05:00.480 --> 05:04.480
That was an interesting effect.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.480
Felt a little like Star Wars.

05:06.480 --> 05:10.480
Good morning, Madam President and members of the Board.

05:10.480 --> 05:14.480
And to staff and to all who are following today.

05:14.480 --> 05:20.480
I'd like to start by congratulating our 29 California Blue Ribbon schools who are being

05:20.480 --> 05:24.480
recognized in Washington, D.C. as we speak.

05:24.480 --> 05:30.480
These schools have been recognized for their efforts in the past.

05:30.480 --> 05:38.480
These schools have been recognized for their efforts in closing the achievement gap for

05:38.480 --> 05:42.480
historically underserved students.

05:42.480 --> 05:49.480
I'm pleased to share with you that California has more Blue Ribbon schools than any state

05:49.480 --> 05:51.480
in our nation.

05:51.480 --> 05:57.480
It was an honor to meet with many representatives from the Blue Ribbon schools this week to talk

05:57.480 --> 06:03.480
with them about the efforts that they have implemented to help achieve these great

06:03.480 --> 06:10.480
accomplishments and to partner with them on ways that they can help other schools in our

06:10.480 --> 06:12.480
state going forward.

06:12.480 --> 06:20.480
As you all know, in the month of October, we released the test scores for California

06:20.480 --> 06:28.480
students, and despite some bright spots, we saw that in California and in the nation,

06:28.480 --> 06:34.480
many students experienced declines in math and reading.

06:34.480 --> 06:39.480
I don't have to put it in context for you what our students have been through all across

06:39.480 --> 06:47.480
the country that has contributed to these declines, but we know that we can support our

06:47.480 --> 06:53.480
students in overcoming these opportunities, and I'm also pleased to share with you some

06:53.480 --> 06:58.480
important resources that have been provided to do so.

06:58.480 --> 07:08.480
As we speak, we are allocating some $7.9 billion to California schools in a discretionary block

07:08.480 --> 07:11.480
grant that is focused on learning recovery.

07:11.480 --> 07:18.480
This means that schools will have resources to promote learning acceleration, to provide

07:18.480 --> 07:22.480
counseling and other supports for our students.

07:22.480 --> 07:28.480
In addition to this block grant, California is providing our schools with more than $4

07:28.480 --> 07:35.480
billion to support expanded learning opportunities, to lengthen the school day, to lengthen the

07:35.480 --> 07:42.480
school year, to provide support to our students during all parts of the day to support their

07:42.480 --> 07:49.480
recovery, and I would also point to what's now $4 billion in community schools resources

07:49.480 --> 07:56.480
to support health, mental health, and other needs that our students have as they heal

07:56.480 --> 08:00.480
and recover and ultimately thrive going forward.

08:00.480 --> 08:05.480
You'll hear more about community schools today, and you'll hear about our technical

08:05.480 --> 08:06.480
assistance programs.

08:06.480 --> 08:12.480
You'll also hear from Dr. Galli from the Department of Health and Human Services who

08:12.480 --> 08:21.480
will talk about our partnership as it relates to the Children's Behavioral Health Initiative.

08:21.480 --> 08:28.480
We've started a learning acceleration webinar series to provide best practices and technical

08:28.480 --> 08:30.480
assistance to our schools.

08:30.480 --> 08:36.480
I want to thank Dr. Darling-Hammond for participating in that first webinar and our partners at

08:36.480 --> 08:43.480
CCEE who shared their learning acceleration blueprint and thank school leaders from Berkeley

08:43.480 --> 08:49.480
Unified School District and from Lodi Unified School District who shared the various programs

08:49.480 --> 08:53.480
that they are providing to support our students.

08:53.480 --> 08:58.480
As we think about learning recovery, I'd like to also remind you that California is

08:58.480 --> 09:05.480
making a historic investment to school districts for reading coaches and specialists who will

09:05.480 --> 09:11.480
help our educators to strengthen their ability to teach reading to our youngest children.

09:11.480 --> 09:17.480
This is an exciting investment of more than $250 million that is paired with an investment

09:18.480 --> 09:24.480
in funding for professional development to support educators as it relates to supporting

09:24.480 --> 09:25.480
reading.

09:25.480 --> 09:32.480
I'm also excited that this grant funding gives us a way to work with a cohort of 125

09:32.480 --> 09:38.480
school districts to support them in reading but also to engage them in math and other

09:38.480 --> 09:41.480
subjects where we can support students.

09:41.480 --> 09:46.480
And if we can help those 125 school districts imagine what we can do for helping to move

09:46.480 --> 09:49.480
things in the right direction for California.

09:49.480 --> 09:52.480
Our webinar series will continue in just a few weeks.

09:52.480 --> 09:57.480
We'll be providing school districts with direct information about how the learning recovery

09:57.480 --> 10:05.480
block grant will work and some of the intended allocations and how they can use those dollars.

10:05.480 --> 10:09.480
We're also going to be providing a webinar for school districts on dealing with the opioid

10:10.480 --> 10:11.480
crisis.

10:11.480 --> 10:19.480
Many of you have followed in the news that sadly we've seen a steep rise in incidents

10:19.480 --> 10:22.480
related to fentanyl.

10:22.480 --> 10:28.480
Many children ingesting fentanyl often not knowing that they are and that this has had

10:28.480 --> 10:30.480
deadly consequences.

10:30.480 --> 10:37.480
We've convened partners in health, in public health, in prevention, in education programs,

10:37.480 --> 10:43.480
in law enforcement and others to help translate for school districts what it is that they

10:43.480 --> 10:48.480
need to do to prevent loss of life due to fentanyl.

10:48.480 --> 10:54.480
We will be putting on a webinar for districts to help them leverage all the resources that

10:54.480 --> 11:01.480
exist for education, for prevention, for substance abuse, intervention and of course

11:01.480 --> 11:06.480
intervention for someone who is overdosing from fentanyl.

11:06.480 --> 11:13.480
California is making NARCAM available to California schools and just a few days ago

11:13.480 --> 11:18.480
I sent a letter to every single school district in our state imploring them to take up this

11:18.480 --> 11:23.480
very important cause, to work with us and the Department of Public Health in having

11:23.480 --> 11:30.480
available NARCAM and in utilizing every single resource for education, for prevention, for

11:30.480 --> 11:35.480
substance abuse, intervention and to use the federal dollars that are also provided that

11:35.480 --> 11:39.480
can be used for substance abuse, prevention and education.

11:39.480 --> 11:45.480
And finally I want to highlight a webinar that we will be putting on in just a few weeks

11:45.480 --> 11:47.480
that we call Educator Wellness.

11:47.480 --> 11:53.480
We recognize how difficult the work of our teachers and classified staff and administrators

11:53.480 --> 12:00.480
and school board members and others continues to be and we will be convening a conversation

12:00.480 --> 12:03.480
about wellness for educators throughout the state.

12:03.480 --> 12:07.480
We see this as a critical part of our work to help retain our workforce.

12:07.480 --> 12:15.480
I'm grateful to Dr. Darling-Hammond, to the governor, to the legislature, to the Commission

12:15.480 --> 12:20.480
on Teacher Credentialing for work that we did last year, to the state board and others

12:20.480 --> 12:26.480
on work that we did last year to find ways to retain teachers, many teachers who are

12:26.480 --> 12:31.480
new teachers, teachers who are completing some of their requirements, but we know that

12:31.480 --> 12:36.480
we have to take stock in the hard work that educators do every day and have been doing

12:36.480 --> 12:39.480
certainly during the pandemic and how we can support them.

12:39.480 --> 12:44.480
We look forward to being joined by our surgeon general who will help us to lift up the ways

12:44.480 --> 12:50.480
that school districts can help our educator workforce and support them.

12:50.480 --> 12:56.480
This builds on our work that we're doing to support recruitment and retention and so

12:56.480 --> 13:02.480
we hope that you will join us for these webinars and look forward to the publicity of these

13:02.480 --> 13:08.480
events announcing the dates and the content that will be provided.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.480
This concludes my formal remarks.

13:10.480 --> 13:19.480
I'd like to just take a few minutes to acknowledge some great staff who have provided incredible

13:19.480 --> 13:26.480
service to the students of California and who have announced their retirement.

13:26.480 --> 13:35.480
With your permission, Dr. Darling-Hammond, I'd like to recognize Judy Sias for her 11 years

13:35.480 --> 13:41.480
of incredible service to the state board of education, to the state of California.

13:41.480 --> 13:46.480
Yeah, that deserves a hand clap.

13:46.480 --> 13:54.480
Judy has demonstrated a kind of unwitting knowledge of everything that is EDCO,

13:54.480 --> 14:02.480
almost like an encyclopedic knowledge and has been an incredible leader in our work.

14:02.480 --> 14:11.480
I don't know if Judy's in the room, but the lawyers have just told me that Judy is in fact in the room.

14:11.480 --> 14:21.480
This just in and we'd like to have a moment to recognize Judy and thank you and embarrass you

14:21.480 --> 14:25.480
and appreciate you for your incredible service.

14:25.480 --> 14:31.480
We have some gifts for you and some certificates for you and I know you don't want to,

14:31.480 --> 14:36.480
but perhaps you'd like to have a few words while we do this.

14:36.480 --> 14:40.480
Let's please welcome Judy as she comes.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.480
Congratulations.

14:49.480 --> 14:51.480
Hello.

14:51.480 --> 14:55.480
I always said when you hear from a lawyer, there's probably not a good sign as to how the meeting is going,

14:55.480 --> 14:58.480
but maybe in this case it's okay.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.480
So I wrote down what I wanted to say.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.480
So I wanted to thank everyone for your kind wishes.

15:04.480 --> 15:08.480
It's been a real honor to be appointed to work for the state board

15:08.480 --> 15:15.480
and I've been very lucky to be part of a team that's been doing such amazing work over the years for the kids of California.

15:15.480 --> 15:22.480
I'd like to thank the SBE executive directors that I've worked with, Super, Karen Staff Walters, and Brooks Allen.

15:22.480 --> 15:26.480
They've all been very supportive and amazing colleagues.

15:26.480 --> 15:31.480
I'd also like to thank Superintendents Thurmond and Torlakson, each and every board member,

15:31.480 --> 15:36.480
and especially Presidents Linda Darling Hammond and Mike Curse for their leadership.

15:36.480 --> 15:41.480
It's been a real privilege to work with such titans in the field of education.

15:41.480 --> 15:50.480
I'd also like to recognize the small but mighty SBE team, my colleagues at CDE as well as the Department of Finance and the governor's office.

15:50.480 --> 15:53.480
I've learned a lot from everyone.

15:53.480 --> 15:59.480
And I want to say a special thank you to Amy Holloway, who is my partner over at CDE.

15:59.480 --> 16:04.480
I could not have done this job without her support and friendship.

16:04.480 --> 16:12.480
So those of you who work with us at the state board, you know that we spend an inordinate amount of time planning these meetings.

16:12.480 --> 16:18.480
We study the schedule and we study the agenda and estimate how long each item might take.

16:18.480 --> 16:24.480
So even though it's only nine o'clock, I'm sure we're behind schedule already or very close to it.

16:24.480 --> 16:30.480
So I'm going to and President Darling Hammond is looking at the clock worrying about keeping things on track.

16:30.480 --> 16:33.480
I will stop talking and spare you a long speech.

16:33.480 --> 16:36.480
And thank you very much for everything.

16:41.480 --> 16:46.480
I know that what you just shared was privileged, but we are privileged to have heard from you.

16:46.480 --> 16:52.480
And I know that board members will want to acknowledge you directly, Judy, for your incredible service.

16:52.480 --> 17:03.480
I'd like to also acknowledge another great attorney who's also retiring, Amy Holloway, our general counsel at the California Department of Education.

17:03.480 --> 17:14.480
After 26 amazing years to the state of California, beginning her legal journey and state service at the FPPC,

17:14.480 --> 17:24.480
defending and interpreting so many lawsuits that have come in and helping to guide our work across many issued areas,

17:24.480 --> 17:33.480
but also in partnership with many, many state agencies, the State Board of Education and of course, just every state agency that you can imagine.

17:33.480 --> 17:38.480
We will miss you and want to also congratulate for incredible service.

17:38.480 --> 17:41.480
Amy Holloway, please welcome her as she comes.

17:44.480 --> 18:01.480
Good morning.

18:01.480 --> 18:05.480
I don't know that I'm going to get through this without crying and the echo.

18:05.480 --> 18:12.480
Superintendent Thurman, chief deputy, Mary Nicely, board president, Linda Darling Hammond and board members.

18:12.480 --> 18:18.480
Maybe for the last time, I'm general counsel Amy Bisson Holloway with the Department of Education.

18:18.480 --> 18:24.480
Lisa, one of my colleagues here in the room has already started crying, so that's going to be hard.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.480
But I want to thank all of you for this opportunity.

18:26.480 --> 18:34.480
I especially want to thank the superintendent and the chief deputy for the opportunity to serve in this position in your administration.

18:34.480 --> 18:39.480
It's been very meaningful and a great way to end my career with the state.

18:39.480 --> 18:42.480
I also need to thank my family.

18:42.480 --> 18:45.480
They are just such an important part of my life.

18:45.480 --> 18:48.480
My mom and dad were both high school math teachers.

18:48.480 --> 18:57.480
And I realized in thinking about this this morning that they taught my sisters and I that math was about aptitude and hard work, not about gender.

18:57.480 --> 19:03.480
We didn't know we were learning that message as we did, but as we were being raised, but we did.

19:03.480 --> 19:13.480
All three of us have degrees in science based fields and have become good thinkers and I think good people because of their compassion and love our whole lives.

19:13.480 --> 19:24.480
I have two sisters, Ellen and Trish, who were role models to me my entire life, even when they were torturing me because I was the middle child and it was fun.

19:24.480 --> 19:30.480
My husband, John Holloway, who's a third grade teacher, and he may be watching this with his class.

19:30.480 --> 19:33.480
So Thomas Edison Elementary School Language Institute.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.480
Go Tigers.

19:36.480 --> 19:40.480
He's been my life partner and a support system.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.480
It was never my job to do the laundry or to pick up kids.

19:43.480 --> 19:48.480
We did that together and so that both of us could achieve our dreams and work hard.

19:48.480 --> 19:56.480
My daughters, Kylie and Emily, who think I'm a hero just because I have a passion for education and for public service.

19:56.480 --> 20:00.480
They are just wonderful people and I'm lucky to have them in my life.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.480
I have a family here at CDE.

20:02.480 --> 20:07.480
I've been here for 21 years and I'm grateful to all of you for giving me opportunities to lead.

20:07.480 --> 20:23.480
I've learned something from all of you every day and Judy said it much better than I about our relationships with outside folks from the legislature, Department of Finance, Governor's office, office.

20:23.480 --> 20:28.480
I want to thank those advocacy groups that we've worked with and professionals in the field.

20:28.480 --> 20:38.480
Even when we didn't agree, our commitment to the children of California brought us to good resolutions and disputes and regulations and guidance to the field.

20:38.480 --> 20:41.480
I want to especially thank my staff in the legal division.

20:41.480 --> 20:46.480
They are just wonderful, hardworking, smart, passionate folks.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.480
It's such a strong team.

20:48.480 --> 20:55.480
You will be fine without me and you probably won't even miss me in a couple months, but take a couple months to miss me.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.480
That would be good.

20:57.480 --> 21:06.480
I also want to recognize the legal and audits divisions and the charter schools divisions that are under my branch for their hard work and commitment to the children of California.

21:06.480 --> 21:11.480
They're just a wonderful staff and I've been very fortunate to lead and work with them.

21:11.480 --> 21:20.480
And lastly, I want to thank my mentors and personal support groups, Marsha Bedwell, Eileen Gray, Todd Smith and Judy Sias.

21:20.480 --> 21:31.480
I would not have made it at this job, been successful, would not have failed and been able to pick myself back up without their support and kindness and intelligence and good thinking.

21:31.480 --> 21:34.480
So I'm sure I've forgotten things, but thank you all very much.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.480
I have really enjoyed this opportunity.

21:41.480 --> 21:46.480
Thank you, Amy.

21:46.480 --> 21:59.480
And thank you for being a great leader for our department and for legal audits and the charter divisions and for the plug for mathematics.

21:59.480 --> 22:01.480
Thank you.

22:01.480 --> 22:27.480
I'd like to also recognize another attorney who's provided 20 years of service and has played a critical role on many matters related to charter schools, instructional materials, nutrition services and has developed expertise in these areas over many, many years.

22:27.480 --> 22:38.480
And that is Todd Smith, who is also retiring after 20 years of service and has served as our chief counsel to the department.

22:38.480 --> 22:43.480
Todd, thank you for your incredible leadership in the department.

22:43.480 --> 22:46.480
Thank you for your sense of humor and your thoughtfulness.

22:46.480 --> 22:50.480
And congratulations on your announced retirement and you will be remiss.

22:50.480 --> 23:01.480
And if you'd come forward, we'd like to also recognize you.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.480
Well, good morning.

23:03.480 --> 23:08.480
State Superintendent President Darlingham and board members.

23:08.480 --> 23:11.480
I've been practicing law for about 30 years.

23:11.480 --> 23:18.480
The first 10 years I was in the private sector and didn't find that all for all that fulfilling.

23:18.480 --> 23:32.480
So I looked around at the people in my life and the person who had the career that I admired most and the person who I admired most was my mom, who was a long time public teacher.

23:32.480 --> 23:39.480
30 years ended her career in FLAO City Unified after 30 years of teaching there.

23:39.480 --> 23:46.480
So, you know, I realized teaching wasn't really a rational decision at that point, watching how hard she worked.

23:46.480 --> 23:56.480
So I decided to come here to CDE and to hopefully help teachers like her and students in the state of California.

23:56.480 --> 23:59.480
That was a great decision.

23:59.480 --> 24:08.480
And working here has been just a wonderful experience, especially working with amazing attorneys like Amy and Judy and another attorney who's retiring.

24:08.480 --> 24:11.480
I'm sure we'll be mentioned soon, Liz Stein.

24:11.480 --> 24:14.480
Also, all the attorneys in the legal office.

24:14.480 --> 24:18.480
It's been just a great experience.

24:18.480 --> 24:24.480
It's been a pleasure representing the state superintendent, the board, the CDE.

24:24.480 --> 24:28.480
Thank you so much for acknowledging my service here today.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.480
I'm truly honored.

24:30.480 --> 24:36.480
Thank you.

24:36.480 --> 24:43.480
I thank you and congratulations to Liz who can't be here today.

24:43.480 --> 24:52.480
And I'm going to turn this over to you, Madam President, in case you and the board members want to have some remarks for those who are retiring.

24:52.480 --> 25:00.480
But if we could have one more round of applause for Judy and Amy and Todd.

25:00.480 --> 25:06.480
Congratulations.

25:06.480 --> 25:08.480
Thank you so much, Superintendent Thurman.

25:08.480 --> 25:16.480
And we would also like to thank Amy Holloway and Todd Smith for their service to the state, the department and the board.

25:16.480 --> 25:21.480
You know, we've gotten such wise counsel and deep expertise and institutional knowledge.

25:21.480 --> 25:24.480
It will be greatly missed.

25:24.480 --> 25:32.480
And Amy, it'll be more than a couple of months that we will be thinking about missing you and Todd as well.

25:32.480 --> 25:35.480
Brooks, I believe we have certificates of appreciation for Amy and Todd.

25:35.480 --> 25:47.480
Would you please present them now?

25:47.480 --> 25:51.480
Amy, on behalf of the board, thank you so much for everything you've done.

25:51.480 --> 25:54.480
Couldn't say more than what the superintendent and Linda have said.

25:54.480 --> 26:05.480
But your leadership and your camaraderie and your support both personally and professionally to all the board members and to us as board staff is incredibly important.

26:05.480 --> 26:09.480
And honestly, I don't know what it's going to be like without you, but I'm scared to find out.

26:09.480 --> 26:16.480
But anyway, thank you.

26:16.480 --> 26:20.480
And Todd, Todd and I know each other even before I was in this job.

26:20.480 --> 26:24.480
Anyway, Todd, likewise, I just echo everything that's been said.

26:24.480 --> 26:34.480
Incredibly thoughtful, a problem solver in every way, both making sure everything was legally accurate, but also really always looking out for the interest of students and teachers like your family.

26:34.480 --> 26:37.480
And that always came through in all the work you did.

26:37.480 --> 26:41.480
And I know the board has really appreciated all of your partnerships throughout the years.

26:41.480 --> 26:46.480
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.

26:46.480 --> 26:51.480
And we'll send this to you, Liz, wherever you see this recording.

26:51.480 --> 27:00.480
And of course, I'm not forgetting our wonderful departing chief counsel, Judy Sias, or that she's leaving us bereft, I might add.

27:00.480 --> 27:13.480
And I will come back for a proper celebration of Judy after I complete the president's report because we have a couple of additional things for her to experience.

27:13.480 --> 27:18.480
So I will focus on where California schools are in this moment.

27:18.480 --> 27:30.480
We're not quite post pandemic here where I guess we're in the endemic, as they say, but we are working hard not only to rebalance, but to accelerate learning at a time of great need.

27:30.480 --> 27:35.480
And many of us have heard talk about learning loss and learning recovery.

27:35.480 --> 27:45.480
I just want to clarify because I've heard some misunderstandings of the term that students individually have not gone backwards in their learning.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.480
They have not lost learning that they had.

27:47.480 --> 27:55.480
But the concern is that they have not been progressing over this period of the pandemic as quickly as they would have had.

27:55.480 --> 28:03.480
We not had all of the challenges and stress and trauma that children and families and schools have have experienced.

28:03.480 --> 28:12.480
So it's really about what might be called learning lag or a slower rate of progress that many people experience, many students have experienced.

28:12.480 --> 28:26.480
And the rate of gain is what we are really now trying to focus in on so that when we say that third graders did less well than last year, we're not talking about those third graders moving backwards,

28:26.480 --> 28:36.480
but that the cohort of third graders has not been gaining as rapidly as we might have seen for that group of students in the past.

28:36.480 --> 28:41.480
So last week, the National Assessment of Educational Progress results were released.

28:41.480 --> 28:51.480
This is the only measure that can look comparably at achievement across all the states, and it gives us a certain kind of barometer for understanding where we are.

28:51.480 --> 28:58.480
It's called the nation's report card, and it tests a sample of fourth and eighth grade students in every state in math and reading.

28:58.480 --> 29:07.480
And typically, NAEP, as it's called, is administered every odd numbered year, but there was no NAEP in 2020 or 2021 due to the pandemic.

29:07.480 --> 29:17.480
So the release marked the first national results since 2019 before the pandemic, and the results pointed both to our challenges and to our opportunities.

29:17.480 --> 29:37.480
So the scores, as Superintendent Thurman noted, went downward across the country between 2019 and 2022, again, meaning that fourth graders in this cohort were not achieving the same level as fourth graders in a previous cohort and similarly for eighth graders.

29:37.480 --> 29:44.480
But California students lost less ground than most states in every area and less ground than the national average.

29:44.480 --> 29:49.480
And in the key area of eighth grade reading, California students showed no learning loss at all.

29:49.480 --> 29:52.480
So we were comparable to where we were in 2019.

29:52.480 --> 29:58.480
As a result, California has moved up in the state by state rankings across the board.

29:58.480 --> 30:09.480
And in eighth grade reading, California has moved from 48th in the country in 2013, about a decade ago, at the very bottom, all the way up to the national average.

30:09.480 --> 30:19.480
So we're seeing that the results of the investments that we're making are making a difference and certainly doing so relative to other states.

30:19.480 --> 30:28.480
Among cities, there's a special city part of the NAEP where large cities are able to be tested and reported on.

30:28.480 --> 30:33.480
Both Los Angeles and San Diego were in the NAEP urban districts analysis.

30:34.480 --> 30:41.480
Not only did both do better than most other cities and the urban average, which dipped several points across the nation,

30:41.480 --> 30:47.480
but Los Angeles actually gained slightly in fourth grade reading and significantly in eighth grade reading,

30:47.480 --> 30:52.480
while San Diego remained the top scoring urban district in the nation in eighth grade reading,

30:52.480 --> 30:57.480
and it scores states stable and in the top group of cities in fourth grade.

30:57.480 --> 31:04.480
And I just want to note that we've been fortunate to have Alison Yoshimoto-Towry join the board,

31:04.480 --> 31:09.480
and she was the chief academic officer in Los Angeles during this period of time.

31:09.480 --> 31:16.480
So some part of this success is due to the work of her and her many colleagues there.

31:16.480 --> 31:23.480
This is not to minimize the extensive work that is still needed both to recover and to continue supporting our students to forge ahead.

31:23.480 --> 31:30.480
And while our decreases were less than those in most other states, our achievement levels have been and are much lower in math,

31:30.480 --> 31:32.480
a point to which we will return.

31:32.480 --> 31:39.480
And as you know, we will be hopefully not only adopting a mathematics framework early 2023,

31:39.480 --> 31:44.480
but also investing in its strong implementation.

31:44.480 --> 31:48.480
But I do think there are two important takeaways from the NAEP results.

31:48.480 --> 32:01.480
One is that California's swift and comprehensive actions almost from the very minute COVID was discovered in our state are probably the reason for these relatively better outcomes.

32:01.480 --> 32:13.480
Since the earliest days of the pandemic, California has invested nearly $24 billion to both assure the safety of students and teachers and provide intensive supports to keep students learning.

32:13.480 --> 32:18.480
And many of those dollars are allocated in ways that will continue into the future.

32:18.480 --> 32:24.480
They were not just one time moments for recovery.

32:24.480 --> 32:30.480
This all hands on deck effort has left no aspect of education untouched for bridging the digital divide,

32:30.480 --> 32:33.480
focusing in on learning support from the beginning.

32:33.480 --> 32:49.480
Superintendent Thurman and myself and the first partner and the governor all were rolling up our sleeves from the minute the schools physically closed to pull digital devices by the tens of thousands into our schools.

32:49.480 --> 32:53.480
And then the legislature added on enormous investments.

32:53.480 --> 33:01.480
And we're continuing to add on for connectivity, offering digital integration guidance with extensive professional development for teachers,

33:01.480 --> 33:06.480
upgrading HVAC systems, supporting free COVID testing and vaccinations.

33:06.480 --> 33:24.480
So we had the fewest school closings per capita in the nation last year, expanding learning into before school, after school and summertime, intensifying social, emotional and mental health supports, bringing on tutors and coaches and investing in teacher recruitment and retention.

33:24.480 --> 33:45.480
Los Angeles, for example, did all of these things using state and federal funds and initially deploying into its own reserves to ensure that students got food, computers and hotspots immediately upon school closing, offering universal summer school and tutoring for the last three years, supporting mental health supports and community schools initiatives.

33:45.480 --> 34:00.480
Los Angeles was also able to open school this year with all of its vacancies filled, while many districts were experiencing substantial shortages in part because it was one of the first districts to offer substantial wage hikes and retention bonuses last year.

34:00.480 --> 34:12.480
And we were told because of an aggressive recruitment campaign and its several teacher residency programs, which produced the well-prepared supply of teachers in shortage areas who've been staying in the classroom.

34:12.480 --> 34:29.480
Los Angeles also put in place a coherent plan to support reading both in the lower grades and in the middle schools with an interdisciplinary approach that infused literacy into every subject area, giving students the opportunity to continue to develop their reading and writing skills throughout the grades.

34:29.480 --> 34:41.480
So you'll also hear later in the meeting about evidence from our state tests that learning recovery may have been happening at a steeper rate over this past year than in the years before the pandemic.

34:41.480 --> 34:52.480
So most importantly, the scores show us that California's commitment to the academic progress of every student must continue in full force in the days, months and years to come.

34:52.480 --> 34:56.480
We cannot take our foot off the accelerator now.

34:56.480 --> 35:14.480
These data serve as a clarion call to push forward the transformation of California schools that's been begun over the last three years when Governor Newsom and the state legislature increased school spending by 30% and began to redesign the system to meet 21st century needs.

35:14.480 --> 35:42.480
And these initiatives include the universal preschool for all four-year-olds with its initial expansion this year, universal free school meals, summer school and after school learning and supports for literacy and STEM, many of which are already underway, with new standards for elementary teachers and educational specialists for their training for teaching, as well as educator preparation programs and others which will follow.

35:42.480 --> 35:52.480
It also includes the $4 billion expansion of community schools, which research shows can help increase school attendance, improve learning and increase graduation rates.

35:52.480 --> 36:05.480
And it includes the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative that will connect closely with schools to ensure our students are able to thrive and focus on their learning free of the toxic stress that accompanies trauma.

36:06.480 --> 36:11.480
We have an item on community schools that will include an update on the Behavioral Health Initiative today.

36:11.480 --> 36:14.480
I'm very excited for us to all hear about it.

36:14.480 --> 36:23.480
The whole child approach is critical to creating the kind of environment that supports high quality learning for every campus and every child across our state.

36:23.480 --> 36:35.480
With both local and state leaders focused and ready to do everything possible to help students rebound and thrive, we will redouble our efforts to ensure that every student succeeds.

36:36.480 --> 36:58.480
And with that, I'm going to move on to our more bittersweet business, and we are going to properly and fully acknowledge and congratulate our beloved Chief Counsel Judy Sias on her upcoming retirement and celebrate her many contributions to our 1,000 school districts, 10,000 schools and almost 6 million students.

36:58.480 --> 37:26.480
During her 11 years as Chief Counsel, spanning two governors, two state board presidents and three executive directors, Judy has helped guide California's public education system through major changes, including implementation of the local control funding formula, its new state accountability system, the transition to new online assessments, new charter school policy, new curriculum frameworks and instructional materials, among many other things.

37:26.480 --> 37:50.480
Her work includes analyzing complex memoranda and agenda items, reviewing contracts, providing oral and written legal advice to board members, staff and advisory committees, directing and reviewing the work of litigation counsel to ensure alignment with the policy direction of the board, managing cases, writing and reviewing amicus briefs, but Judy's skills go far beyond those.

37:50.480 --> 37:55.480
With her help of her dog Bindi, Judy is the ultimate problem solver.

37:55.480 --> 38:06.480
So whenever we have an issue that arises that requires creative thinking, the staff and often the board members turn to Judy, and Judy leashes up Bindi for a long walk.

38:06.480 --> 38:15.480
Typically, the game plan is found by the time they return home or arrive at Chocolate Fish, their favorite coffee shop, whichever comes first.

38:15.480 --> 38:26.480
And I have to admit that I've been on a number of those calls with Judy where we do amazing problem solving, which Bindi sometimes chimes in and helps with.

38:26.480 --> 38:32.480
Judy is also a foremost expert on California education policy and the education code itself.

38:32.480 --> 38:37.480
The superintendent noted that she has an encyclopedic knowledge base that is indeed true.

38:37.480 --> 38:44.480
Her remarkable ability to set the context by explaining the history of any issue is an invaluable asset.

38:44.480 --> 38:53.480
And more than once when asked a question, Judy responds with the exact section of the education code in which the answer is found, quoted chapter and verse.

38:53.480 --> 38:56.480
That book is usually open on her desk, by the way.

38:57.480 --> 39:01.480
Judy is also an adept relationship builder before coming to the state board.

39:01.480 --> 39:11.480
She was assistant general counsel for the California School Boards Association, somehow managed to not only keep up with the many relationships developed there, but add new ones at the state board.

39:11.480 --> 39:16.480
And more than anything, Judy is a great friend who is always there for a colleague in need.

39:16.480 --> 39:24.480
Her ability to lighten up the mood with a spirited but often off key version of a pop song will also be sorely missed.

39:24.480 --> 39:26.480
So we want to wish Judy best of luck.

39:26.480 --> 39:29.480
We want to continue to learn from you in the days ahead.

39:29.480 --> 39:32.480
We do have a certificate for Judy.

39:32.480 --> 39:35.480
And Brooks, would you please do the honors?

39:44.480 --> 39:46.480
Thank you again. I really appreciate all this.

39:46.480 --> 39:52.480
I realized when Amy and Todd were speaking that their parents were both teachers.

39:52.480 --> 39:55.480
My mom was a teacher. My dad worked at community college.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.480
So I think there's a theme here.

39:57.480 --> 40:05.480
I remember the first thing I did with education was my dad had me put door hangers walking around against Prop 13.

40:05.480 --> 40:10.480
So I've been working on education issues my whole life.

40:10.480 --> 40:13.480
And thank you for the Bindi call out.

40:13.480 --> 40:17.480
And I'm sure Chocolate Fish appreciates the advertisement as well.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.480
Thank you very much.

40:27.480 --> 40:36.480
Wow. That's an interesting historical reference to Proposition 13, which we've been trying to get over ever since.

40:37.480 --> 40:42.480
So thanks for your efforts as a child also, Judy, in that regard.

40:42.480 --> 40:44.480
Well, we're going to move on to item two.

40:44.480 --> 40:55.480
And item two is the 2023-2024 State Board of Education student member recommendation of three finalists for submissions of the governor for consideration and appointment.

40:55.480 --> 41:04.480
And while we have just welcomed Naomi to the board and we're delighted to see you, Naomi, it's already time to begin the selection process for next year's student member.

41:04.480 --> 41:14.480
So the State Board of Education's screening committee recommends that the State Board approve the three finalists for the position as identified in the item addendum.

41:14.480 --> 41:22.480
And the approved finalists will be forwarded to the governor for his consideration and appointment as the 2023-24 State Board student member.

41:22.480 --> 41:27.480
This item will be presented by the screening committee chair, Vice President Glover Woods.

41:27.480 --> 41:30.480
Vice President Glover Woods, please begin.

41:31.480 --> 41:33.480
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

41:33.480 --> 41:40.480
And again, congratulations, Judy, Amy, Todd, and Liz. Congratulations on your retirement.

41:40.480 --> 41:46.480
I'm excited to bring this item forward to the State Board of Education for approval.

41:46.480 --> 41:52.480
The student member selection process is always one of the highlights of the work of the screening committee.

41:52.480 --> 41:59.480
And as it has been in years past, we had a remarkable group of students, applicants this year.

41:59.480 --> 42:02.480
Just a little background on the process.

42:02.480 --> 42:11.480
Every year, high school students in their junior year are invited to submit applications to serve as the State Board of Education student member.

42:11.480 --> 42:16.480
This year, we had 20 phenomenal students applied.

42:16.480 --> 42:26.480
The applicants were screened by the screening committee and narrowed to 12 candidates, and the screening committee met on October 18th to do that work.

42:26.480 --> 42:35.480
The 12 candidates that were selected by the screening committee attended the Student Advisory Board on Education Conference.

42:35.480 --> 42:42.480
And at that conference, they made presentations to their peers, the student delegates that were at the conference.

42:42.480 --> 42:50.480
The student delegates chose six candidates who were interviewed by the State Board of Education screening committee yesterday.

42:50.480 --> 43:02.480
Members Escobedo, Lewis, McQuillan, Porter and I have the very difficult task of selecting three finalists who we will be considering today.

43:02.480 --> 43:06.480
If our recommendations are approved by the State Board of Education,

43:06.480 --> 43:21.480
The names of the three applicants will be submitted to the governor's office for consideration and final selection of the one student who will serve as the 2023-24 student member of the State Board of Education.

43:21.480 --> 43:25.480
It's my pleasure to announce the three finalists.

43:25.480 --> 43:32.480
Anya Ayyapan, Eduardo Corona and Kristi Tu.

43:32.480 --> 43:43.480
At this time, I would like to ask Anya, Eduardo and Kristi to introduce themselves and tell us the school they attend and the name of their school districts.

43:43.480 --> 43:49.480
So I believe, oh, I see them right there in the conference room.

43:49.480 --> 43:57.480
I would like to first ask for Anya to come forward and introduce herself, school and district.

43:57.480 --> 44:00.480
Hi, everyone. Can you guys hear me?

44:00.480 --> 44:10.480
It's great to see all of you. My name is Anya Ayyapan. I attend Doherty Valley High School in San Ramon, which is a part of the San Ramon Valley Unified School District.

44:10.480 --> 44:17.480
Yeah, I think that's it. It's great to be here. Thank you so much for the opportunity.

44:17.480 --> 44:25.480
Thank you, Anya. I'd now like to invite Eduardo to introduce himself, his school and school district.

44:25.480 --> 44:36.480
Hi, everyone. My name is Eduardo Corona. I attend Canyon Springs High School in Murno Valley, which is in the Murno Valley Unified School District. It's great to see everyone.

44:36.480 --> 44:45.480
Eduardo, it's great to see you as well. And now I'd like to invite our third finalist, Kristi, to the podium to introduce herself, school and district.

44:45.480 --> 44:57.480
Hi, everyone. My name is Kristi. I attend Northwood High School in Irvine Unified School District, and it's an honor to meet all of you.

44:57.480 --> 44:59.480
Thank you, Kristi.

44:59.480 --> 45:12.480
I'd also like to acknowledge Sela Han, Sue Oh, and Katie Sin, who were identified as candidates for the 2023-24 student board member position.

45:12.480 --> 45:20.480
I'd like to give them an opportunity to also introduce themselves and tell us where they attend school and the name of their school district.

45:20.480 --> 45:24.480
Sela, would you go first, please?

45:24.480 --> 45:34.480
Hi, everyone. My name is Sela Han. I attend Torrance High School, which is in Torrance Unified School District, and it was an honor to be here to meet all of you.

45:34.480 --> 45:38.480
Thank you, Sela. Now I'd invite Sue to the podium.

45:38.480 --> 45:48.480
Hello, my name is Sue. I attend Sunny Hills High School in Florida to join UA High School District, and I'm so honored to be here today.

45:48.480 --> 45:53.480
And Katie, if you would come and introduce yourself, school and school district.

45:53.480 --> 46:01.480
Good morning, everyone. My name is Katie Sin, and I attend Palm Desert High School at Desert Sands Unified, and thank you for having us here today.

46:01.480 --> 46:08.480
Thank you, Katie, and congratulations to the finalists and also those who we had opportunity to interview yesterday.

46:08.480 --> 46:15.480
Lastly, I will acknowledge six additional students who were selected by the screening committee as semifinalists.

46:15.480 --> 46:23.480
These students are Alexis Aguilar from Granite Hills High School in the Grossmont Union High School District in San Diego County.

46:23.480 --> 46:31.480
Anne Albumalala from El Camino Fundamental High School in the San Juan Unified School District in Sacramento County.

46:31.480 --> 46:39.480
Kira Bird from Fred C. Byer High School in Modesto City Schools in Stanislaus County.

46:39.480 --> 46:48.480
Nathra Damodaran from Daugherty Valley High School in the San Ramon Valley Unified School District in Contra Costa County.

46:48.480 --> 46:58.480
Luvani Madari from Angelo Rodriguez High School in the Fairfield-Susan Unified School District in Solano County.

46:58.480 --> 47:06.480
And Issei Nagada from Anaheim High School in the Anaheim Union High School District in Orange County.

47:06.480 --> 47:11.480
So again, congratulations to all of those students.

47:11.480 --> 47:17.480
And President Darling-Hammond, I will turn it back over to you.

47:17.480 --> 47:23.480
Thank you so much. What a pleasure to meet all these amazing students.

47:23.480 --> 47:28.480
I think at this point we are about to open for public comment.

47:28.480 --> 47:34.480
And I think we need the public comment slide to be displayed.

47:34.480 --> 47:41.480
And we will open the phone line as soon as that happens for public comment.

47:41.480 --> 47:51.480
There we go. Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item may do so by calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the slide that is shown now.

47:51.480 --> 48:01.480
While we're waiting for members of the public to call in, I want other board members who participated in this year's student selection process, if they have any comments.

48:01.480 --> 48:08.480
Members Lewis, Escobedo, McQuillin and Student Member Porter to make such comments.

48:08.480 --> 48:13.480
Then if there are any clarifying questions, we can take them before we get to public comment.

48:13.480 --> 48:15.480
Member McQuillin.

48:15.480 --> 48:24.480
Yes, thank you. It was my honor to participate in the interviews this week with the students.

48:24.480 --> 48:32.480
It was one of my favorite things. Really, really difficult decision to select three from the six candidates.

48:32.480 --> 48:41.480
And just dynamite students that represent California so well, role models that represent their schools and their school districts.

48:41.480 --> 48:48.480
It was a very difficult decision and a real pleasure to interview the students. Thank you.

48:48.480 --> 48:50.480
Thank you very much.

48:50.480 --> 48:53.480
Thank you. Member Porter.

48:53.480 --> 49:00.480
I want to say congratulations to all of the top 12, the top six, the top three and thank you to everyone who applied.

49:00.480 --> 49:03.480
It is a hefty application process.

49:03.480 --> 49:07.480
So thank you for saying yes to being that voice for students.

49:07.480 --> 49:16.480
And I had a great time meeting all of you in person at SABE discussing ways that we can continue to further advocate for student needs.

49:16.480 --> 49:23.480
And so thank you for spending your weekend, your Halloween weekend, working on the heart of these proposals to all the delegates.

49:23.480 --> 49:32.480
And thank you to all the upperclassmen who you may not be directly affected by these policies, but you really want to create this improved schooling experience for your peers and lower grades.

49:32.480 --> 49:37.480
So congratulations to the top three and to every student who applied.

49:37.480 --> 49:43.480
Thank you so much. Member Lewis.

49:43.480 --> 49:52.480
Good morning. I just wanted to add that it was a pleasure just sitting in on the interviews and meeting all of these young people.

49:52.480 --> 49:55.480
I just want to say thank you to all of those who applied.

49:55.480 --> 50:09.480
And it was just encouraging to meet them and just to hear their passion and their desire to make an impact on education for not only for themselves, but for their fellow students.

50:09.480 --> 50:14.480
So congratulations to all who applied and to our finalists.

50:14.480 --> 50:18.480
Thank you. Member Escobedo, did you want to add anything?

50:18.480 --> 50:28.480
Yes, I applaud all those teachers that made an influence in the lives of these young, young scholars, because they truly were scholars.

50:28.480 --> 50:36.480
Their passion, their thoughts, their really care for humanity was a prevalent topic in each one of them.

50:36.480 --> 50:49.480
So I thank you for all the amazing educators to mold these young lives into just amazing young adults and future great citizens in our society.

50:49.480 --> 50:55.480
Thank you. Thank you. And I want to add my thanks to all the board members who participated in this.

50:56.480 --> 51:13.480
It's one of the more pleasurable commitments, but it is an intense commitment to participate and to help us in this process and add my thanks to all of the young people who applied and had the opportunity to share their ideas in this way.

51:13.480 --> 51:18.480
We will now see if there's any public comment. Is there any public comment?

51:18.480 --> 51:22.480
We do not have anyone in the queue for this item.

51:22.480 --> 51:27.480
All right. And if there's any other further board discussion?

51:31.480 --> 51:32.480
Seeing none.

51:35.480 --> 51:43.480
Board members, I guess I need a motion now for putting forward these names. Member Glover Woods.

51:43.480 --> 52:04.480
Thank you. I move that the State Board of Education approve the three finalists for the position of the 2023-2024 Student State Board of Education as identified in the item addendum and as was presented to you today.

52:04.480 --> 52:07.480
Thank you. And do I have a second? Member Porter?

52:07.480 --> 52:09.480
I second the motion.

52:09.480 --> 52:15.480
Thank you. We'll now hold a roll call vote. Brooks, can you please call the roll?

52:15.480 --> 52:17.480
President Darlene Hammond.

52:17.480 --> 52:18.480
Yes.

52:18.480 --> 52:20.480
Member Escobedo.

52:20.480 --> 52:21.480
Yes.

52:21.480 --> 52:24.480
Vice President Glover Woods.

52:24.480 --> 52:25.480
Yes.

52:25.480 --> 52:26.480
Member Lewis.

52:26.480 --> 52:27.480
Yes.

52:27.480 --> 52:29.480
Member McQuillan.

52:29.480 --> 52:30.480
Yes.

52:30.480 --> 52:32.480
Member Olken.

52:32.480 --> 52:33.480
Yes.

52:33.480 --> 52:44.480
Member Roscoe-Gonzalez.

52:44.480 --> 52:46.480
She's motioning yes, but I think your volume.

52:46.480 --> 52:47.480
We see you.

52:47.480 --> 52:49.480
We have a problem getting off of mute.

52:49.480 --> 52:52.480
For the record, we see it's an affirmative.

52:52.480 --> 52:55.480
Yes, sorry, I couldn't unmute for some reason.

52:55.480 --> 52:57.480
Member Petilla Broughton.

52:57.480 --> 52:58.480
Yes.

52:58.480 --> 52:59.480
Member Porter.

52:59.480 --> 53:00.480
Yes.

53:00.480 --> 53:02.480
Member Rodriguez.

53:02.480 --> 53:03.480
Yes.

53:03.480 --> 53:05.480
Member Yoshimoto-Tauri.

53:05.480 --> 53:06.480
Yes.

53:06.480 --> 53:13.480
Motion passes unanimously.

53:13.480 --> 53:20.480
We're now going to take up item three, the 2022 Student Advisory Board on Education Conference.

53:20.480 --> 53:29.480
This item will be presented by the student representatives who participated in the 2022 Student Advisory Board of Education annual conference.

53:29.480 --> 53:35.480
This item has an addendum, which is the 2022 Sabe Conference Report.

53:35.480 --> 53:43.480
First, I'd like to ask Board Members McQuillan and Student Board Member Porter, as this year's liaisons, if they have comments to share.

53:43.480 --> 53:49.480
So, Member McQuillan, would you like to queue us up?

53:49.480 --> 54:00.480
I just know the students have worked so hard this year on preparing themselves and sacrificing their time, you know, around Halloween, as was said earlier.

54:00.480 --> 54:06.480
That's a sacrifice, you know, of being at the conference and preparing themselves.

54:07.480 --> 54:19.480
I'm really confident for the future of California and all of our students and our communities, because we're in good hands with the students that you'll hear from today.

54:19.480 --> 54:23.480
So thank you for all your work and your sacrifices.

54:23.480 --> 54:25.480
Thank you.

54:25.480 --> 54:26.480
Terrific.

54:26.480 --> 54:27.480
Member Porter.

54:27.480 --> 54:40.480
So I just want to take this moment to thank the leadership at CASC, all the counselors, the researchers, the delegates for committing their time to improve our education system and giving up your time to do so.

54:40.480 --> 54:52.480
Ultimately, the decisions that are made here in Sacramento and on this board affect students, and I'm just constantly amazed by the passion and the dedication of the delegates and staff.

54:52.480 --> 55:11.480
They not only spent their weekend, but their Halloween weekend ahead of college application deadlines, that's November 1st, staying up until 3am, 4am in the morning last night to edit proposals, revise and research, and wake up early the next morning, ready to get feedback and ready to advise and to revise their proposals.

55:11.480 --> 55:21.480
So thank you for your commitment, and it was a pleasure to meet and interact with all of you, and I am excited to hear your proposals again for this board today.

55:21.480 --> 55:22.480
Terrific.

55:22.480 --> 55:40.480
And we do have various presenters for this item, so each presenter will be introduced by Ava Gebhardt, who's the Education Policy Director of the California Association of Student Councils, with a brief introduction by Ellie Leann, this year's state president of CASC.

55:40.480 --> 55:43.480
So Ellie, please begin.

55:44.480 --> 56:03.480
Good morning Superintendent Thurmond, President Darlene Hammond, Vice President Glover Woods, and esteemed members of the board. My name is Ellie Leann, I am a senior at Portola High School in Orange County, and I also have the privilege of serving as the current state president of the California Association of Student Councils, otherwise known as CASC.

56:03.480 --> 56:16.480
This year's Student Advisory Board on Education, SABE, has been especially rewarding, as directors and delegates alike have shown incredible resilience and flexibility navigating their first time in person since COVID-19.

56:16.480 --> 56:25.480
Hearing the unique visions of students from all across California coalesce into a collective movement of change has reaffirmed the power of youth.

56:25.480 --> 56:44.480
Of course, this experience could not have been possible without our 12 dedicated student board member candidates, the current student board member Naomi Porter, who oversaw the election process before race and supported the candidates to her fullest capability, and lastly our core conference team who worked tirelessly to make SABE possible.

56:44.480 --> 56:55.480
This opportunity to create and share our proposals has been an unparalleled experience for our delegates, and we thank the California Department of Education for dedicating their time to honor our voice.

56:55.480 --> 57:04.480
Your recognition of us not only as students, but also as emerging changemakers is what propels us forward, and for that we thank you.

57:04.480 --> 57:16.480
Without further ado, I welcome the CASC Education Policy Director, Ava Gephart, for more on today's presentations.

57:16.480 --> 57:27.480
Thank you for the introduction, Ellie. Good morning, President Darling-Hambon, Vice President Glover Woods, and esteemed board members. My name is Ava Gephart, and I'm a senior at Foothill High School in the Shasta Union High School District.

57:27.480 --> 57:35.480
I'm the Education Policy Director of the California Association of Student Councils and the 2022 Director of the Student Advisory Board on Education.

57:35.480 --> 57:45.480
Since 1963, the Student Advisory Board on Education has given students throughout the state of California a voice to propose changes in education policy to the State Board of Education.

57:45.480 --> 57:52.480
59 years later, students continue to need to brainstorm, discuss, and make these proposals in the span of our four-day conference.

57:52.480 --> 58:03.480
This year is monumental for us. For the first time in three years, behind me sits 40 delegates from throughout the state who have traveled to Sacramento to make a difference within their education system.

58:03.480 --> 58:14.480
The proposals the students provide before you are completely of the students' own creations, made up of the experiences and knowledge of students who experience the California education system day by day.

58:14.480 --> 58:20.480
With this staff act as neutral parties within the process of leading the groups to get the student voice as a whole.

58:20.480 --> 58:25.480
Today, I come forward to you with a delegation of students ready to enact a positive change.

58:25.480 --> 58:36.480
Our delegation has created comprehensive proposals on the issues of teacher qualification and training, political literacy, mental health, school safety, and socioeconomic equity.

58:36.480 --> 58:43.480
I'm confident that our proposals being presented are of the utmost concerns identified by the delegation of our students.

58:44.480 --> 58:50.480
I would like to thank all of you for this opportunity and for our students to present their proposals to you all.

58:50.480 --> 59:00.480
And without further ado, I will go ahead and introduce Ida Ahola, who will be doing the teacher qualification and training speech.

59:00.480 --> 59:16.480
A video recently went viral of a Riverside teacher donning a fake headdress and chanting during a lesson.

59:16.480 --> 59:28.480
While teaching the math lesson of Sakatoa, she stomped around the classroom, made chopping motions, and pretended to pray in an effort to mimic racialized Native American stereotypes.

59:29.480 --> 59:39.480
Riverside Unified School District only acted to fire the teacher after the video went viral and the district experienced pressure from Native American advocates.

59:39.480 --> 59:49.480
Students should not have to rely on internet virality and community resources in order to hold their own teachers accountable for misconduct.

59:49.480 --> 59:55.480
Good morning Superintendent Thurmond, President Darling-Hammond, Vice President Glover-Woods, and esteemed board members.

59:55.480 --> 01:00:01.480
My name is Ida Ahola and I'm a senior from Northwood High School in the Irvine Unified School District.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:18.480
On behalf of the Student Advisory Board of Education, we urge the State Board of Education recommend local education agencies adopt the existing CDE uniform complaint procedure as a universal UCP form instead of using individually LEA-created forms.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:31.480
This universal form would be clearly present online on district and school platforms as well as being printed on paper to ensure faculty is held accountable within the state of California.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:41.480
As a consequence of the innate power imbalance within schools between teachers and students, students often feel as if they have no power in holding their own teachers accountable for misconduct.

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:55.480
Whether it be for fear of retaliation or ignorance of resources like the UCP, many students who feel belittled by their administration do not know that they have the option to report their teachers, let alone navigate this procedure.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:02.480
Our hope is to create an accessible process for students to share their concerns regarding their educators.

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:14.480
My peers and I propose that the board adopt the existing state uniform complaint procedure as a universal outline for students and parents to report administrators' misconduct with ease.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:25.480
Additionally, the universal UCP form would be multilingual and published in all school and district websites, at district offices as printed copies, and in person at school sites.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:33.480
The UCP is a system undertaken by individual districts to ensure compliance with applicable state and federal laws and regulations.

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:38.480
The UCP addresses issues of discrimination, bullying, and harassment.

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:46.480
Currently, all school districts in California are required to have a compliance officer or body to address complaints from the UCP.

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:54.480
The UCP has jurisdiction over all programs and activities implemented by the state as well as personnel.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:02:02.480
Students can file the UCP themselves or have parents file on their behalf with the goal of eventually conducting an investigation into the staff report.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:11.480
We appreciate all efforts in legislation that has led to the creation of the UCP, but in its current form, it remains inaccessible.

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:16.480
Many districts do not provide an outline or display the form on many of their platforms.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:21.480
Students find that they must excavate through links to find their district's UCP form.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:27.480
Clearly publishing the form on district websites and in person decreases the barriers of filing.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:33.480
With the pre-established system of the UCP, the implementation of our solution would have very low monetary cost.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:43.480
By translating the UCP form, students and teachers or students and parents would feel highly encouraged to express their experiences because of the form's linguistic versatility.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:50.480
Additionally, the UCP creates a recorded documentation of repeated violations by faculty members.

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:56.480
This allows for future jobs to access a faculty member's possible history of misconduct.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:02.480
It would allow for full transparency and credibility of a faculty member when hiring new staff.

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:11.480
This decreases the risk of repeated instance of inappropriate misconduct from teachers at different districts, securing a safer learning environment.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:21.480
We hope that the board will adopt the existing state UCP form as the universal outline for students and parents to report administrators' misconduct.

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:33.480
The increased availability of the form in multiple languages, both online and on district websites in person, at district schools and offices, will empower students to hold their teachers accountable for misconduct.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:39.480
Increased access to the UCP form will enforce a safe learning environment for all students.

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:45.480
Though teachers are the ones who hold the power in the classrooms, it is students who have the most at stake in those environments.

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:56.480
Thus, it should be student voices that we are uplifting, as it is students that we all serve. Thank you for your time.

01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:06.480
Thank you so much. We're going to take two or three board member questions after each of these presentations.

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:12.480
So we're open for questions if there are some or comments.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:17.480
Member McQuillin.

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:22.480
Yeah, I just want to say thank you for the great presentation. Very good job.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:33.480
One question or comment is the consideration of restorative practices also in the effort would be really fantastic.

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:44.480
As human beings, we do put our feet in it sometimes, and we make errors, and we have faults.

01:04:44.480 --> 01:05:01.480
And every culture has that restorative effort and an avenue where people can make right and get back onto a good pathway by the act of forgiving and making the situation right.

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:06.480
So that's just a consideration in the whole thing. Thank you for your presentation.

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:14.480
Thank you. Member Rodriguez.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:24.480
I meant to unmute and instead I applauded. Thank you, President Darlene Hammond, and thank you so much for that wonderful presentation.

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:34.480
And I agree. I agree that learning environments should be safe. They should be safe places for students.

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:41.480
They should feel comfortable, not feel like they're being bullied or harassed in any way.

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:54.480
And I also agree with Member McQuillin, right, you know, that there is, as a teacher, you know, I want all of my students to feel safe and I want them to feel that they're walking into a trusting environment.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:06:01.480
However, as a human being, I also know that I may do something that could be misinterpreted.

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:13.480
And so I would hate for a student who, you know, just got a bad grade on a test or on an assignment to interpret that as bullying.

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:36.480
So while it's important to have a place where students can get that information and, you know, make sure to ensure that they have, that we're creating the safest environments, we also need to make sure that we have prongs in place to support us as human beings and as teachers, right?

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:57.480
You know, and that the due process is also there so that it doesn't become, you know, like the teacher that's very strict or this that students have a problem with that maybe it becomes personal.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:11.480
So and I absolutely applaud all of your work. I always look forward to your presentations and your presentation was fabulous. Thank you so much.

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:33.480
So I'm going to ask if you'd like to respond either to the ideas about due process or restorative practice and maybe add one more thing to your thinking and response, which is do you have recommendations about teacher training on the front end that you think would be helpful in creating these safe spaces?

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:36.480
So we're turning it back to you for your thoughts.

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:49.480
Yes, absolutely. All of the questions you have asked and comments are something that we've tried to keep in mind through our proposal. In its current form, the UCP does ensure confidentiality, but it is not anonymous.

01:07:49.480 --> 01:08:15.480
So students who file do have to state their name and describe the instance that occurred. So we hope that with this link to the individual student and with it not being an automatic termination per se, instead an investigation into the incident, we hope to also hold students accountable because we do understand that this form could be misused very easily.

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:36.480
So we hope that through the inclusion of a name, but ensure confidentiality that students are deterred from misusing this form purposefully. So I think that answers that hopefully. And so that's the current system that is already in place for the UCP.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:44.480
Thank you. Thank you for your response. Did you have anything else you wanted to add?

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:49.480
No need. I just want to be sure I didn't interrupt you before you were done.

01:08:49.480 --> 01:09:06.480
The issue about training. I understand that our topic is a bit misleading, but as a group while we were discussing this proposal, we kind of came across the two forks in the road of, do we want to address teacher training or teacher accountability?

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:30.480
And these were the two kind of areas that we had to battle with. And originally we have leaned towards the training path, which is why our topic suggests that we were focused on training. However, we found that addressing the training curriculum for teachers was a bit more complex than we had the resources to address at the moment.

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:42.480
And so we found the UCP is a form already in place. This is a system that has precedent. There's procedure to it already. It is a procedure.

01:09:42.480 --> 01:10:00.480
And so our goal is to not essentially change that, but just to make it more accessible for students. And we found that through this proposal, we were able to make though more niche changes, we hope more feasible changes with our proposal.

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:10.480
Thank you. Thank you. We appreciate so much both the proposal and the presentation. And we'll move on to the next presenter.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:24.480
Thank you so much. Our next presenter will be from the political literacy group. So when singer will be our presenter.

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:35.480
The 2020 Annenberg civics knowledge survey found that only one half of Americans can name all three branches of government and less than half understood the fundamental democratic principle of self governance.

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:45.480
Our current curriculum is simply too little too late as students who are reaching voting age are inadequately informed on how to vote or navigate political language with our democratic process.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:59.480
Good morning, Superintendent Thurmond, President Darling, Darling, Charlie Hammond, Vice President Glover Woods and honorable board members. My name is Gwen singer and I'm a senior at Venice High School in Venice, California, part of the Los Angeles Unified School District.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:06.480
My peers and I proposed the modification of existing state standards on civic curriculum in order to promote political literacy.

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:16.480
Political literacy is defined as the knowledge, understanding and navigation of democratic structures and their impacts across local, state, national and even global levels.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:21.480
It is the season and ability to both interpret and apply concepts pertaining to governmental issues.

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:31.480
While political literacy encompasses civic engagement, it also clips students with the knowledge and tools to make educated decisions and function as well informed civic participants.

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:43.480
In light of the public over-reliance on media that provides what is often highly partisan political news, schools should carry the responsibility of objectively informing students about political structures and processes of government.

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:50.480
The first time I encountered any formal civic curriculum was this year when I started my senior year AP government class.

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:58.480
The California Education Code currently requires three years in social studies in order to graduate high school, including a singular semester of government.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:07.480
But from within our proposal group, almost half of our students have observed that government and civics education is restricted solely to seniors in their schools.

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:13.480
This means that for many students, their first exposure to political curriculum is when they're about to graduate.

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:18.480
Every single student within California schools is a constituent of American democracy.

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:22.480
We are the next generation of stakeholders, voters and decision makers.

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.480
We need a robust civic education.

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:35.480
Only through consistent reinforcement of the principles of the democratic process, governance and policies that affect our everyday lives, will students be empowered to be active, educated participants in the political process.

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:40.480
Only then can they make their voices heard and apply their knowledge to real world situations.

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:49.480
Currently, the state seal of civic engagement exists as an incredible incentive to students that prioritize their civic education and engages active democratic participants.

01:12:49.480 --> 01:13:04.480
Using this as a stepping stone, we urge the State Board to place a greater focus on the civic frameworks than history and social science standards so that all students across K-12 education are more politically literate and motivated to engage with and understand the politics and policies that affect them.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:17.480
The Student Advisory Board on Education urges the State Board of Education to revisit and expand the existing history and social science standards through the incorporation of a milestone system of successively implemented standards throughout the K-12 progression.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:29.480
This milestone framework can be presided over by appropriate California Department of Education staff who will readdress the existing educational standards and systemically incorporate greater emphasis on a political curriculum framework.

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:33.480
This would entail that at certain grade levels, students will be familiar with age-appropriate concepts.

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:42.480
We advocate for simulations of election processes and judicial review to be integrated in primary schools where students can experientially model what these processes look like.

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:49.480
We also recommend an expansion to include formal political instruction regarding voting, elections, and key aspects of government in middle schools.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:14:00.480
We also encourage an interdisciplinary approach in high schools to ensure that students understand the practical applications and the language usage of the political process and policies that exist in the world around them.

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:12.480
The appropriate CDE staff to preside over the modification of these curricular standards will expand the existing frameworks within primary and secondary schools, particularly emphasizing political concepts may be fully objective at any point.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:24.480
They may reconvene every five years to revise and update standards in accordance with the most relevant democratic principles that students should be well versed in, as well as ensure the frameworks maintain a neutral, nonpartisan position.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:29.480
The last time these standards were updated was in October 1998.

01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:36.480
Students are subject to antiquated standards that are older than they are, so the solution is a more modern education based on modern standards.

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:45.480
We implore you to implement these updated standards as soon as possible as now, more than ever, students are in need of a nonpartisan, credible source of information in schools.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:49.480
This affects the future of state and national civic engagement and innovation.

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:54.480
When students are well educated and politically literate, democracy as a whole becomes accessible.

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:56.480
The content already exists.

01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:58.480
We just need to reconsider the standards.

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:07.480
Subsequently, students can familiarize themselves with the world of politics through a long-term political education free from the polarization, contention, and bias that emerges in other sources.

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:19.480
By updating these standards in accordance with our proposed milestone model, the earlier, more expansive, and consistent implementation of nonpartisan political education standards makes certain that students have a firm understanding of all levels of government.

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:26.480
They will be motivated and prepared to take on the world of politics and policy, both prior to and once they reach voting age.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:30.480
It will ensure that students are ready to fulfill what it truly means to be a citizen.

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:33.480
Thank you for your time.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:35.480
Thank you so much.

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:40.480
And so timely with the elections just a few days away.

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:46.480
Let's see if there are comments or questions from any of the board members.

01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:48.480
Member Porter.

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:50.480
Thank you so much, Gwen, for your presentation.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:16:02.480
Something that I really admire about your proposal is that it isn't just a one-time lesson for our students with this idea of a milestone framework, very similar to the seal of civic engagement.

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:14.480
Learning at a young age, really the basics of our government and fostering good voting habits and reiterating the importance of being a contributing citizen will really only lead to a more productive and informed society.

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:26.480
So as a first-time voter myself voting in this next election, I had to acquire skills about the deliberation of issues and candidates really outside of the classroom through my own research.

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:33.480
And so I guess my main comment is also to highlight the importance of an unbiased approach when teaching this political literacy.

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:39.480
I think that's something that can oftentimes be tricky to do, but I want to highlight the importance of that in the classroom.

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:46.480
So I want to thank you again, Gwen, for your proposal, your presentation, your comprehensive research, and your clear passion that will benefit so many students.

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:49.480
So thank you.

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:50.480
Awesome.

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:54.480
Vice President Glover Woods.

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:55.480
Thank you.

01:16:55.480 --> 01:17:00.480
And thank you so much for a wonderful presentation on political literacy.

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:07.480
And again, as President Darley Hammond said, quite timely considering what will be taking place in the next few days.

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:36.480
I would definitely like to applaud the emphasis on objectively presenting the information in a nonpartisan way and also acknowledging that knowing, getting information throughout the educational journey, if you will, from elementary school, middle school and high school is a very positive way to look at how to engage civically and what that does indeed mean.

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:47.480
I have a question, and I am perfectly comfortable if this is not something that the team has talked about, so please feel comfortable to say we didn't even talk about that.

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:59.480
You mentioned in your presentation simulations, and I was just kind of wondering, what might those simulations look like at the elementary level?

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:09.480
What might they look like at the junior high and middle school level? And how might they look different at the high school level?

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:13.480
Yeah, so I would actually love to talk about that. That is a really big thing that we focused on.

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:19.480
So a lot of our group members talked about how when they were in elementary school, they would model different processes.

01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:26.480
For example, it talked about modeling the American Revolution. They talked about there were a couple examples that I can't recall off the top of my head.

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:45.480
But for example, the process of electing a line leader in elementary school education, learning how people can vote for that, learning how people can potentially campaign for that, even placing greater emphasis on the maybe fourth, fifth grade class president elections and talking more about what that process looks like in the real world.

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:57.480
Because in elementary school, of course, these processes are much more simplified, but introducing them to the formal terminology or the formal descriptions of what this will look like once they reach a voting age.

01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:02.480
And then in middle school, kind of just expanding this a little bit more, maybe making them a little more complicated.

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:07.480
I know in my middle school, we had class president and class boards more than just a president and vice president.

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:11.480
We had the introduction of new positions. We had treasurer. We had secretary.

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:19.480
So that expansion into, like I said, the more terminology, the more in-depth of the process.

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:28.480
And then in high school, I'd actually love to share an anecdote. In my AP government class about two weeks ago, we did a week long campaign model, election model, voting model.

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:33.480
We talked about all of the political candidates and propositions that have been presented.

01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:42.480
Regardless of our own personal bias or personal beliefs, we were randomly assigned a proposition and a candidate to campaign for, whether it was the mayor, the governor, the senators.

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:47.480
And it was a really wonderful chance for all of us to learn what it was like to run a campaign.

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:55.480
And that kind of hands on learning and hands on research, just having the students directly experience it themselves was so incredible for my understanding.

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:59.480
I didn't know how this worked behind the scene. I didn't know what kind of research went into it.

01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:03.480
And that experience really allowed me to do that. And my AP government teacher was amazing for that.

01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:13.480
And that's why I would love to see or think our whole group would love to see more simulations like that implemented or encouraged within the state standards.

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:18.480
It sounds like you've had some very exciting teaching.

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:22.480
Member Patil Bronson.

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:38.480
Good morning. I just want to thank you for the presentation and clearly I love that you're bringing such lived experience and positive ways of lifting up both your AP government class and also thinking about how to interweave this type of experiential

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:42.480
learning at sort of the elementary and middle school levels.

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:55.480
The question I had, I appreciate and I think that several board members have given voice to the need for this to be a nonpartisan activity, which I absolutely agree with.

01:20:55.480 --> 01:21:15.480
I have maybe two questions. One is around how you would approach ensuring and promoting the idea that there would not just be sort of a tolerance of differing political viewpoints, but actually a respect and a healthy sort of discourse that could grow.

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:29.480
And then the second is about how you think about the critical thinking skills that are required in order to filter political information.

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:51.480
There's so much right now on the internet that is about really hot temper more than anything and not so fact based and how would you think about actually building that into a curriculum of how to evaluate different claims that are being made around the political system.

01:21:51.480 --> 01:22:04.480
I think that this is where the interdisciplinary approach really comes in. For example, in English classes, making sure students can identify and navigate the language usage and from understanding language usage, you can kind of determine implicit bias.

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:14.480
So making sure that that's an emphasis from schools within, you know, science classes talking about the policies and legislation that went into different discoveries.

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:23.480
A big point of our proposal is it's not necessarily talking about modern candidates or modern political issues from the perspective of both sides of the spectrum.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:41.480
It's making sure that students understand the processes behind things, understand what it means to be a voter, participate in elections, how these biases may be emerged rather than what they are today, talking about what led to bias, how can we look at sources and identify an implicit bias.

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:50.480
And this is where the CDE staff would preside over. They have the knowledge and the expertise to know what is appropriate and what is not appropriate to include in state standards.

01:22:50.480 --> 01:23:05.480
But the focus would really be, it's not an op-ed. It's not a chance for teachers to push their biases on students. It's time for defining these definitions, define these processes for students and clearly explain.

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:18.480
Within our political system, we thrive off of discourse, we thrive off of diversity, making that a huge point that every single end of the spectrum has something invaluable to contribute and it's about finding the objective nature behind it.

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:31.480
Once again, that interdisciplinary approach really helps finding the science behind politics, finding the history behind politics, focusing on set patterns and set precedents and how that's affected the modern political sphere will allow students to develop those critical thinking skills as well.

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:41.480
We focus on patterns. We focus on change over time. And that's one amazing thing about the AP curriculum, even something that we can look to the AP curriculum for, is they focus so much on these historical patterns and historical developments.

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:58.480
And I think that's a really good, a really great way to pull information that exists, once again, standards that exist and just modify that these need to be implemented into state standards that kind of focus on pattern and development and change over time and definitions of how things really work fundamentally.

01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:00.480
That's how that needs to be incorporated.

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:02.480
I hope that somewhat answers your question.

01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:06.480
It does, and I just want to thank you again for such an outstanding presentation.

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:10.480
Thank you. We all, we all appreciated it.

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:21.480
Let's move to the next presentation.

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:39.480
Thank you so much. Our next presenter will be from the mental health group, and I now introduce Helios Lung.

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:51.480
There are a lot of similarities that my group and I see between California students and California's policymakers. For example, we all care about California's education system, and we all care about bettering that system.

01:24:51.480 --> 01:25:05.480
But it seems the biggest similarity is in the way we deal with mental health. Even though mental health has been a priority of recent state legislation, such as SB 224, this legislation hasn't addressed an important resource to students.

01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:12.480
Other students. Good morning, Superintendent Thurmond, President Darling-Hammond, Vice President Glover-Woods, and esteemed board members.

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:16.480
My name is Helios Lung, and I am a sophomore at Montevista High School in Danville.

01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:23.480
I'm speaking to you on behalf of the Student Advisory Board on Education, a subsidiary of the California Association of Student Councils.

01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:29.480
For the past three days, my group and I have focused on how we can target the issue of student mental wellness.

01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:35.480
We're here because we believe that, principally, mental health serves as a root problem for so many issues.

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:51.480
Sure, students are free to speak to their school counselors, but on a fundamental level, mental health resources and the status quo aren't being properly utilized because the distrust and distance between staff and students discourages students from seeking help.

01:25:51.480 --> 01:26:02.480
It only gets harder when mental health stigmatization, established by societal standards and exacerbated by campus culture, makes it dangerously difficult for students to use current resources.

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:09.480
Here's how we've seen this problem addressed. My school holds a yearly event with an organization called Breaking Down the Walls.

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:20.480
Hundreds of students gather in the gym assembly style and walk to the center if they resonate with certain statements, such as walk forward if you've had an eating disorder or walk forward if you've been a victim of domestic violence.

01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:33.480
And to my surprise, students actually opened up. The most important impact this has had in my school is that for the first time, so many students began to empathize with their peers and look past the surface.

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:45.480
For the first time, so many students that were struggling saw that they weren't alone. I saw that when students are reminded that they have support from others, it makes them more likely to seek the help they need.

01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:56.480
But as much as we would like for every student to share that experience, not every school can afford working with an outside organization for several sessions and several hours.

01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:03.480
This problem changes under today's proposal. Our solution suggests statewide access to peer counseling resources.

01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:11.480
But first, what is peer counseling? Peer counseling is when students become informed confidants who function as someone that their peers can speak to.

01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:21.480
Confidence will be trained under the curriculum that school districts provide through the guidelines of this proposal, increasing reliability and relatability for students who need it.

01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:30.480
This also allows for the student helper to have the knowledge to care for their own mental well-being. This proposal allows schools to develop and establish these systems.

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:47.480
Peer counseling is so important because of its efficacy. A study from the Queensland government and James Cook University found that implementation of peer support groups in school environments increased average student satisfaction in guidance, reassurance of worth, and reliable alliance.

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:56.480
That means that for students talking to other students serves as the foundation for improving both accessibility, reliability, and community.

01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:13.480
Our proposal suggests that governing boards of districts provide resources to schools that they're able to train students as student confidants, a set of guidelines that can be used to not only coach students on how to support their peers, but also to become committed to accountability, confidentiality, and empathy.

01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:26.480
Our proposal allows every student to make a difference in their community. At a local level, advisors, whether those are teachers or adult counselors, will manage both peer counseling as well as the teaching of training curriculum.

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:41.480
This proposal is critical because first, it provides districts and local governing boards with the clear guidelines to develop their own curriculum or use curriculum from organizations that already exist and are already successful, such as Mental Health First Aid.

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:54.480
This allows them to best adapt resources to their needs and their exact situation. But second, it makes sure that established schools get the resources they need to create reliable peer counseling systems.

01:28:54.480 --> 01:29:03.480
Because let's face it, when any sort of counseling is done incorrectly, the effects can be devastating. That's what this proposal changes.

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:16.480
But just one more statistic. The University of Virginia finds that 75% of students first reached out to another peer when they were in distress. 11% of students reached out to staff.

01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:26.480
But it only takes the 11 members of this board to change that. Thank you for your time.

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:36.480
Thank you so much. Let's see who would like to ask a question or two. Member Porter.

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:46.480
Thank you so much for your presentation. So one thing that I love about this proposal is that it's based off the idea that it's hard to hate someone when you know their story.

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:59.480
And I think that students are truly an untapped resource to address this. And so I think that peer counseling does allow for a stronger sense of community within schools and really grows that empathy in that school culture.

01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:07.480
And so two things I want to draw upon the importance of is confidentiality within the mentors, as well as the logistics of training these peers.

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:17.480
So my question to you to answer after member Oakland and member Escobedo give their comments is just how these peers are going to be trained and who will be doing that training.

01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:23.480
So thank you again, Helios, for your hard work and for your initiative in addressing this very key issue.

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:33.480
Terrific. I will collect all the questions and then you can answer them all at once. Member Olken.

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:44.480
You're on mute. Thank you. I found it. So first I want to thank you so much and all the students for these incredible presentations.

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:54.480
Really thoughtful ideas about how we can make schools more responsive to students and uplift their voices.

01:30:54.480 --> 01:31:18.480
And I really appreciate the focus on student mental well-being. As a school leader at this moment, I just see every day the really difficult cost, the difficult toll that kids are living with coming out of the pandemic and adults as well, honestly.

01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:40.480
And one of the things we've seen at my school is the really important and powerful impact of affinity groups, so the ways in which when we connect with those like ourselves, some of the stigma and fear and power structures are decreased.

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:49.480
And so I really appreciate the idea of the power of students helping students. It's just it feels like it's such a meaningful approach.

01:31:49.480 --> 01:32:05.480
And my question is similar to what we just heard, which is you made the point that this proposal will address the devastating cost of when counseling isn't effective.

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:24.480
And I was hoping you could double back and just explain that a little bit about how this will help ensure that counseling is effective, because I agree that's a really devastating potential. So thank you.

01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:29.480
Terrific. Member Escobedo will add you.

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:50.480
Thank you. Sorry. Just really curious about some of the research you've seen on peer counseling. I know it definitely has some positive effects, such as creating that connectiveness with the student body, students not being as apprehensive.

01:32:50.480 --> 01:33:06.480
However, have you studied the negative effects of peer counseling, especially for the person that's doing the counseling, if not well prepared, if you don't have even an avenue to help you process what you heard?

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:26.480
You know, sometimes these type of sessions or these constructs can have negative consequences as well. So just wondered if you also looked at some of the drawbacks of peer counseling, especially in the adolescent years. Thank you.

01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:31.480
That's a lot of questions to deal with. We do have one more.

01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:38.480
Member Roscoe Gonzalez, go ahead and add your comment, and then we'll ask for a response.

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:52.480
Thank you. I just have a comment. Actually, I want to let you know that I was a peer counselor over 30 years ago in my high school, and it was just so important for me and for my school.

01:33:52.480 --> 01:34:08.480
And when I was a sophomore, and I got some of the training that you mentioned, which we called mental health first aid, and I thought that that was really important that you said that because it's so important to have reliable counselors and advisors to guide students.

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:22.480
I remember as a young teenager going through extensive training to really not only understand, but to be empathetic and to find ways to ask for help when I couldn't.

01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:38.480
And when I didn't have the answers, because as a teenager, I didn't have a lot of answers, but what I did have was a good year to listen and to want to help and to want to participate in the success of the mental health of a student who was maybe struggling.

01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:58.480
And I remember many times having think tanks and just sessions with group sessions just to break down walls. And I know you mentioned something about breaking down the walls and I remember doing that exercise in the gym and just finding that that was a calling for me and my calling ended up being an education and guiding students.

01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:10.480
And I remember that training being so important when I was a first year teacher and when I was even a middle school teacher, because I felt that I could some of the issues that students had resonated with me.

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:27.480
So I want to just commend this work. And so it's not a question. I want to let you know that this work is important. And it's a way to just engage all the entire community, including students and how to support each other and guide each other through this process of difficulties that we have,

01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:41.480
especially coming out of a pandemic. So thank you. Thank you. That's a wonderful unintended positive consequence of the work. So you have a set of questions. We'll let you respond.

01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:50.480
Okay, thank you so much for the comments and everything. Those were really insightful and we'll definitely take those into consideration. So I'll just move on to answering some of the questions given to me.

01:35:51.480 --> 01:36:01.480
So first, I'll address member Porter's question about who's going to oversee all of this. So addressing my speech and also my proposal, the advisors will primarily be adult counselors or teachers.

01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:10.480
But the reason we still think that works is because under peer counseling, students can speak to a larger number of students because fundamentally it increases access and reliability.

01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:23.480
So student counselors now have access to more information on the general consensus or general issues that the student body suffers from. And then moving on to member Olken's question. Sorry, if you don't mind restating that, I might have forgotten it.

01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:39.480
Absolutely. You said in your speech that there were two things you were hoping to address. And the second one was the sort of the reliability of good counseling.

01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:44.480
And I was wondering if you could explain that piece just a little bit more.

01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:56.480
Okay, sure. So a lot of the students in our group talked about how at their school there's like a general distrust for counselors. And that makes sense, right? There's always rumors about counselors telling your parents and everything.

01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:07.480
So we thought that increasing access to peer counseling is something good. But we saw the obvious concern that like you can't always ensure the quality of peer counseling, which is what we're trying to target with this proposal.

01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:16.480
So we can establish reliable curriculum for every district to properly implement this because that implementation we believe is worse than no implementation at all.

01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:27.480
And then moving on to I believe member Escobedo's question is how will these students, these peer counselors themselves address their own mental well-being?

01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:39.480
So for our research, we actually found that teaching students how to deal with or how to counsel other students taught them to help like deal with their own mental well-being in a healthy manner.

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:45.480
And a lot of students saw benefits to both those being counseled and the counselors themselves.

01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:49.480
And then I think that is all the questions.

01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:56.480
Nice job. Thank you so much. Very thoughtful and very, very constructive. Appreciate it.

01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:02.480
We're going to move on to the next presentation.

01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:16.480
Thank you so much. Our next presentation will be from the School Safety Group and Ashley Castillo will be your presenter.

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:27.480
September 13th, 2022 at 9.43 a.m. in Los Angeles, California. I was working in class until my principal Mr. Devlatian frantically came on the PA system.

01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:34.480
Hollywood High, we are on an immediate lockdown. This is not a drill. Get into your nearest classroom and lock all doors.

01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:40.480
I repeat, this is not a drill. What did my classroom do? Nothing.

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:45.480
At 9.54 a.m., another announcement was made. But despite that, classes anxiously resumed.

01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:50.480
Parents clogged phone lines and surrounded the school interfering with the LAPD.

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:55.480
So what led to all of this in the first place? Our school had become a victim of swatting.

01:38:55.480 --> 01:39:06.480
Police officers arrived, weapons drawn, before the school was notified of a necessary lockdown because the LAPD didn't know which extension number would connect them with the right school office.

01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:13.480
Students didn't know the proper procedures with law enforcement on campus, taking away time from the officers locating the potential threat.

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:24.480
And finally, the school had the wrong evacuation map on file with the LAPD, causing the LAPD to incorrectly evacuate students to an open football field.

01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:32.480
This caused trauma, panic, and put students' lives at risk in the span of two hours.

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:38.480
If it had been a genuine threat to student safety, the consequences could have been devastating.

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:44.480
How was the school supposed to respond to a situation like this when they're not properly informed how to?

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:50.480
Good morning, Superintendent Thurman, President Darling-Hammond, Vice President Glover-Woods, and esteemed members of the board.

01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:56.480
My name is Ashley Ana Castillo. I'm a high school senior representing Hollywood High and the LA Unified School District.

01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:03.480
I've lived in California my entire life and have been a victim of misinformation about our school safety system since I was young.

01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:11.480
I'm here on behalf of the Student Advisory Board on Education, urging you to ensure increased awareness and responses to emergency situations.

01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:16.480
While external factors can be uncontrollable, this doesn't mean we can't prepare internally.

01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:26.480
Our solution strives to combat misinformation and lack of communication regarding school safety protocols by adding a set of school safety guidelines to the

01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:33.480
Existing Comprehensive School Safety Plan as a supplement to the existing recommendations provided under the CDE.

01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:39.480
These guidelines would promote information flow by distributing accessible and comprehensive school safety procedures.

01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:45.480
While ensuring a certain level of statewide standardization, it would also provide ample space for local controls.

01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:53.480
Districts can emphasize protocols regarding specific incidences that are most prevalent to them, whether that be wildfires or drug addiction.

01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:58.480
Materials would be translated into other languages determined by the district's population demographics.

01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:07.480
Lastly, these guidelines would strongly recommend school safety plans being made available to the entire school community through various outlets,

01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:18.480
such as evacuation maps posted in every classroom, uploading certain safety information to district and school websites, and sending copies of the safety plan home with students every year.

01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:28.480
Our guidelines also encourage presenting information with digestible language or even pictures for younger ages, making them accessible to a wider audience.

01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:34.480
The earlier students and staff are taught about these procedures, the more prepared they will be if an event occurs.

01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:41.480
Yes, we already have safety procedures currently in place, but most students are unaware of what they entail.

01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:52.480
Working together, we can ensure that students, staff, and families are aware of such safety measures, starting with tackling the fundamental issue, a lack of information.

01:41:52.480 --> 01:42:00.480
Our school safety guidelines consider the unique circumstances of certain communities without compromising the standard of information shared.

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:08.480
Since they will be placed under an existing resource created by the California Department, our proposal would incur a minimal cost at the state level.

01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:16.480
Additionally, AB 1747 already mandates the distribution of school safety information to local agencies requiring its use.

01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:27.480
Our guidelines would simply place a stronger emphasis on interagency collaboration, bridging the communication gap between local agencies and the school that has occurred regardless.

01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:32.480
So let's revisit that September 13th, now with our school safety guidelines.

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:38.480
Students, teachers, and law enforcement knew when and how to take action.

01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:42.480
With our guidelines, everyone clearly understood next steps.

01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:47.480
The officers smoothly swept the school, found no threat, and the lockdown was lifted.

01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:50.480
That is what should have happened on September 13th.

01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:53.480
That's what should happen in every situation.

01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:55.480
Short and seamless.

01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:59.480
And that is a reality that becomes plausible using our recommended guidelines.

01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:02.480
Thank you.

01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:05.480
Thank you so much for that wonderful presentation.

01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:12.480
Let's see if we have some board member comments or questions.

01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:14.480
Member McQuillin.

01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:26.480
Yes, I just want to say thank you for this presentation and bringing up such an important topic that unfortunately is on our minds quite a bit these days with media coverage.

01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:28.480
Just a great presentation.

01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:32.480
You know, I think training is really important.

01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:41.480
Training for all the players in the situation, for schools is so important on this topic.

01:43:41.480 --> 01:44:03.480
And also, you know, the struggle right now, I know when we think of community schools and opening up our schools for more service providers on campus and more families coming onto campus and trying to find that delicate balance between opening up campuses and keeping campuses safe, I know is a struggle for our schools right now.

01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:08.480
But again, thank you for this topic.

01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:09.480
Thank you so much.

01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:14.480
Member Lewis.

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:16.480
Thank you, Ashley.

01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:18.480
Wonderful presentation.

01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:35.480
And I want to emphasize, like board member McQuillin said, this is such an important topic with everything that has been happening, not only what happened at your local school, but in school districts across the state and also across the nation.

01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:48.480
I think all of the points that you brought up are very important points, and I was sitting here reflecting on things of this nature in the district that I was just associated with before retirement.

01:44:48.480 --> 01:45:02.480
And one of the most important things that you can do is make sure that information is disseminated to the individuals that really need it the most, just like you emphasized.

01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:04.480
The training is so important.

01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:17.480
First of all, when an incident like this occurs, when students are in the classroom, that teacher is the most important person in the room that can direct the students on how they need to react to the particular emergency that's at hand.

01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:19.480
So the training is very important.

01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:27.480
But not only did we learn about not stopping with the training with the adults, but students also need to be informed of what the procedures are.

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:31.480
So the training is very important that you talked about.

01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:34.480
Also, the interagency collaboration.

01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:48.480
I don't know if most school districts across the state were fortunate that we were to have our own police department where we did have meetings throughout the year with the agencies that surround school safety.

01:45:48.480 --> 01:46:09.480
We partnered with the fire department with local law enforcement agencies to take our officers and others through drills at certain points during the year and also made the information about emergencies available in preschool meetings with staff and also in class meetings at the beginning of the year.

01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:16.480
One of my questions, so I just think you brought up a lot of important parts in your presentation.

01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:28.480
And one of my questions is, have you thought about what that training for staff and students should look like statewide and what it should entail?

01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:42.480
I mentioned a lot of important things, so I know that was included in your conversations, but just kind of the scenario that you brought up after all that training, the safety guidelines and everything was in place sounded perfect.

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:48.480
So how do you how do you envision that we make that standardized across the state?

01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:49.480
Great.

01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:59.480
Thank you, Member Lewis. We'll hold that question and wrap it up with the others. If there are more questions, Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:10.480
Thank you, Ashley Castillo from such a wonderful presentation and I think urgent presentation to really have a conversation around clear communication.

01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:30.480
I hear clearly how this was a very traumatic event on the day that you mentioned in panic and I know that as a teacher in the classroom, we've gone through several drills where we tried to disseminate information and be very clear and concise about the guidelines.

01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:52.480
I see that there was a lot of lack of communication and integrating interagency collaboration, and I mentioned how it's so important to have training, multiple forms of communication, and I hear you about the translation of materials, working in a large area of students who speak multiple languages.

01:47:52.480 --> 01:48:01.480
It's important to have communities get information that is in their native language, also sending information home on paper.

01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:15.480
I think it's important to have teachers include this information in their LMS systems to also use those communication apps to also send information like you said, not only on paper, but also electronically.

01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:37.480
And I think how can student voice be included in some of these communications, and I would call them safety drills. How do you think students can become more involved and maybe help local agencies in putting together a more concise drill so that we're prepared?

01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:51.480
Because unfortunately, that's the situation we find ourselves, whether it's a lockdown, an earthquake drill, or a more serious situation, how can students help out through this process? So that's my question to you.

01:48:51.480 --> 01:49:02.480
All right. Thank you very much. Member Patil Bronson. And then we're going to try to move to allowing our speaker to answer the questions.

01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:25.480
I also just wanted to thank you for such a powerful and personal reflection of the school incident that you described. I certainly also think it highlights how important it is to have students as co-designers in the process of creating safe spaces and safe schools.

01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:48.480
One of the questions I think, or I'll limit it to one question that came up as you were describing both the incident as well as the set of recommendations, it does seem that the frequency with which schools are responding to swatting type of events is increasing.

01:49:48.480 --> 01:50:15.480
And so I think the recommendations that you put forward around interagency, information sharing, clarity of processes and procedures all make sense. And I also just wanted to ask if, particularly from the student perspective, if you all reached this area of how you get to prevention in terms of this increased incidence of swatting?

01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:23.480
Wow. Those are some meaty questions and we'll turn back to our presenter for some of the thoughts and answers.

01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:34.480
Thank you so much for all the wonderful questions and comments. We really appreciate it. So starting with the first question on the distribution of this information and how that would be done.

01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:50.480
So originally when discussing this in a group, we had originally thought of school-wide assemblies where this information would be distributed to all students at the same time and staff so that everybody received clear instructions and the same instructions and information.

01:50:50.480 --> 01:51:01.480
And also in these guidelines implementing sort of kind of like a structure curriculum that teachers can use with certain dialogue in terms that can clearly communicate this information to the students.

01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:12.480
So that way the students are all receiving the same information and that everyone is on the exact same page in terms of what to do when something like this happens.

01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:24.480
And then to address the second question about student voice. So of course the school site councils implement student voice already, at least in my high school at Hollywood High.

01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:32.480
I know that we implement student voice through the school site council and the school site council plays a role in creating the comprehensive school safety plan.

01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:53.480
So I think these guidelines would also again place the emphasis on working with these agencies, these local agencies, and having more of these meetings, like I mentioned before, more of these meetings with these local agencies to better construct these lockdowns, to better construct these evacuation routes, to better communicate how the process is going to go.

01:51:53.480 --> 01:52:02.480
Because unfortunately, even though we have bills already to address this and create this communication, there is still a gap of that communication.

01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:09.480
There is still a lack of communication between the agencies and the school site councils in creating the comprehensive school safety plan.

01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:18.480
So I think having this would just place more of that emphasis and create a more cohesive structure that also again implements the student voice.

01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:22.480
And then I'm sorry, could you repeat that last question for me, please?

01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:35.480
I think the last one came from member, no, from member Petia Brownson.

01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:49.480
Just any recommendations as to how to decrease the likelihood or incidence really of these sort of false flags and swatting reports?

01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:56.480
So, you know, what was found was that a lot of these swatting reports were actually found to be outside of halls.

01:52:56.480 --> 01:53:06.480
For the investigation that regarded Hollywood High, it was deemed that this was an outside hall and it was actually made to a classroom that didn't even exist, classroom 106.

01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:09.480
But our school doesn't have a classroom 106.

01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:11.480
So this was deemed to be an outside hall.

01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:21.480
And what we wanted to do with this proposal was, unfortunately, we can't prevent those external forces and those outside forces from interfering with our school safety.

01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:34.480
But what we can do is prepare and to have better preparation, just having these guidelines in place to place the emphasis on the things that would make a more structured plan for the entirety of the school to know how to deal with these incidences.

01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:39.480
So that way it is done in a swift and concise manner as mentioned at the end.

01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:47.480
Excellent. Thank you so much for all of the thoughtful responses as well as the presentation.

01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:51.480
And we're going to move to our last presentation.

01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:05.480
Thank you so much. Next, we have Nathra Dehmaduran who will be presenting the socioeconomic equity group.

01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:06.480
Thank you so much.

01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:07.480
Thank you so much.

01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:28.480
Stuck with the label of underachieving, immigrant and refugee students of lower socioeconomic status were pushed out of their school Davis High and Modesta City schools by school administrators in 2015.

01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:36.480
It was only after public pressure, newspaper articles and federal civil rights complaints that these students were given A's just so that they could graduate.

01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:46.480
This is just one example of painfully affected California students. One example of a lack of representation and administration for a group that truly needed it.

01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:51.480
Good morning President Darlin Hamlin, Vice President Glover Woods and esteemed members of the board.

01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:58.480
My name is Nathra Dehmaduran and I am a junior attending Dorothy Valley High School in the San Antonio Valley Unified School District.

01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:08.480
I'm here to speak about the lack of diverse socioeconomic representation in school districts, specifically in the local control and accountability also known as the LCAP.

01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:17.480
In California, 20% of all network is concentrated in the home of 2% of Californians, otherwise known as just 30 areas of codes.

01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:33.480
This apparent socioeconomic disparity is reflected in our state education system as well. Those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged tend to statistically achieve lower test results, have access to fewer resources and overall have fewer opportunities to be represented and heard.

01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:38.480
Therefore, equitable representation by the public must improve in local school districts.

01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:48.480
Specifically among underserved students, our team identified a lack of community involvement throughout the LCAP process, leading to a lack of representation in educational planning.

01:55:48.480 --> 01:56:01.480
Therefore, we suggest that under the engaging educational partners section of the current LCAP template, a new subsection is added that addresses collaboration between the community and the LCAP advisory board.

01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:08.480
This will make strides towards increasing diversity and educational planning power for low-income students.

01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:24.480
Depending on the district's technology access, committee meeting summaries will be mailed or emailed to community members, translation services can be provided during meetings, and community leaders can emphasize active community outreach events and programs to overall increase diversity.

01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:31.480
The local LCAP committees will allocate funds for the addition of translation services based on the district's demographics.

01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:46.480
Though the LCAP advocates for diverse students and households, more can still be done. The LCAP process at districts was identified as not friendly to the community by district and county leaders interviewed by the California School Boards Association.

01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:51.480
Getting essential community input was noted as a significant difficulty as well.

01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:57.480
This includes feedback from parents, students, and overall adult figures that don't have official roles in the committee.

01:56:57.480 --> 01:57:07.480
Additionally, a lack of participation from parents and guardians of financially disadvantaged students may stem from a lack of knowledge about the committee meetings and proposals.

01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:14.480
Issues such as these are important in the context of overall educational socioeconomic inequity existing in our state.

01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:23.480
In 2014, for example, the high school dropout rate among people 16 to 24 years old was highest in low-income families compared to high-income hearts.

01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:30.480
More parental involvement and increased funding of resources have been shown to improve lower socioeconomic status in schools.

01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:35.480
This can only occur with increased access to knowledge among these communities.

01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:41.480
We envision an environment where underserved students aren't at a higher risk of dropping out of school.

01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:50.480
We envision an environment where people of all backgrounds, races, classes, and incomes can voice their ideas in cleaning the education system that they are a part of.

01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:58.480
We envision an environment where the exacerbating cycle of inequality finally has a chance to come to a halt.

01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:08.480
This potential adjustment of the LCAP template could revolutionize educational equity by reforming LCAP guidelines to allow for increased diverse community participation.

01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:14.480
Underrepresented educational partners can voice their valuable experiences in the LCAP process.

01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:23.480
Representation becomes an actual reality as long as solutions address and recognize language barriers, transportation access, and childcare.

01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:29.480
At Davis High School, the lack of representation meant a lack of equity, but our proposal could change that.

01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:37.480
Including all socioeconomic groups will empower students to take charge of their education, both locally and statewide.

01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:47.480
As a result, they will succeed in an improved environment that prioritizes not only their well-being, but prioritizes the equitable education that every single student deserves.

01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:50.480
Thank you for your time.

01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:53.480
Thank you so much.

01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:57.480
I will turn to board members.

01:58:57.480 --> 01:59:03.480
Member Yoshimura Itari.

01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:06.480
Good morning. Thank you to all the students for your presentations today.

01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:21.480
I wanted to highlight that I was recently reading a book from the late Mike Rose, and he talked about how those with a lived experience have to be closest to the decision makers, people that have the ability to make decisions.

01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:35.480
And so as we listen to you today as our student leaders, I think one of the questions that I'll have for you is you're actually in a position to influence things at your schools and in your organizations.

01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:45.480
And so how might there be other ways of continuing to do what you're doing today at the state board locally at your schools?

01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:52.480
And a good example is the previous example around school safety.

01:59:52.480 --> 02:00:04.480
And then I want to make a comment to you about the fact that California is now asking graduating seniors, particularly for socioeconomic equity, to complete the FAFSA.

02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:16.480
And there was a report that last year, almost 500 million dollars was unclaimed in California for PAL grants.

02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:36.480
And so to support your student colleagues, particularly in this last presentation, I'd be curious to know either now or later, what might be some things you can do to share the opportunities to get grants for higher education to help improve socioeconomic equity.

02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:40.480
Great question. Member McQuillen.

02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:44.480
Yes, thank you. And thank you for the great presentation.

02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:57.480
One of the most important, if not the most important topics to bring up in education in ensuring we have representation from our lower socioeconomic families.

02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:08.480
You mentioned that, you know, access and childcare and transportation as being, you know, barriers that we can remove.

02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:27.480
I'm wondering if you considered, you know, incentives or other, you know, rewards that could help involve our lower socioeconomic representation in the LCAP process.

02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:35.480
You know, many of our families are struggling now with how to pay for food versus utilities versus transportation.

02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:41.480
And it could grease the wheels to get that participation with providing some incentives.

02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:46.480
But great presentation and very important topic. Thank you very much.

02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:53.480
Terrific. And member Lewis, your hand is up here, but I think maybe it was left up from before. Is that correct?

02:01:53.480 --> 02:02:06.480
Okay, so I'll turn to our presenter and see if you want to answer those questions.

02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:14.480
So for the first question, I'll say thank you so much for all the questions and comments. We'll definitely take that into consideration and they're really helpful.

02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:28.480
For the first question about continuing student voice locally, I think that, as you said, it's very important to continue that locally, especially considering the environment we're in right now, where we have the opportunity to do things at a much higher statewide level.

02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:41.480
So locally, personally, I would say that one of the things that I could do is participate more in, I guess, specific to our topic, encouraging my local LCAP advisory committees to engage more in schools.

02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:55.480
I think that one of the things we mentioned is about outreach. And one of the ways we can do that outreach is by requesting these committees to talk in school-wide assembly meetings in order to access more students and talk to these students about how families can get involved in the process.

02:02:55.480 --> 02:03:03.480
And I think that's one of the best ways to do that outreach, to access all demographics. And I think that's something that many students can do as well.

02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:17.480
For the second question about grants, grants are obviously a great way to gain access to increasing socioeconomic status. And I think for promoting that, that also just comes with the knowledge and awareness that may be lacking right now.

02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:33.480
So I think especially along with our proposal, if we're able to increase the outreach and overall accessibility towards the knowledge of these LCAP meetings and their proposals, one of the things we can highlight in these meetings and proposals could be the access to grants that are being underused right now.

02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:44.480
And I think that as soon as we're able to have more public participation, there'll overall just be more public knowledge about these grants and therefore better socioeconomic status for everybody.

02:03:44.480 --> 02:04:00.480
And then for the last question about, I believe the last question about the incentives that can be offered, that's obviously one of the biggest things that we discussed in our group as well, how to get these parents engaged even if accessibility is granted because that doesn't necessarily guarantee that engagement.

02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:16.480
So one of the things we found is that an incentive in itself could be the virtual conferences. A lot of the statistics we found were that there was like a nine-fold, six-fold increase in the amount of participants just because these meetings turn into virtual conferences.

02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:31.480
And like eliminating things like transportation access, that in itself is an incentive to join these meetings because you no longer have to worry about fees and you can take care of your kid while working at home and still participate in the educational process.

02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:44.480
And obviously these processes are up to the local district's discretion. So if local districts have the budget to offer more economic incentives and tax incentives, that would be a great way to approach having more engagement.

02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:48.480
And if these districts have the capability, then our team would greatly encourage that.

02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:53.480
Terrific. Thank you. Member Yoshimura Tari, did you want to add a comment?

02:04:53.480 --> 02:05:05.480
Just a comment. I wanted to highlight that you really elucidated three things. You elucidated how we communicate that newspapers may not be the way that students are communicating.

02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:22.480
So we need to think about how we communicate and what language we communicate. And three, where we put communication, because those are very timely. And then the many of the groups you talked about, community, trust, relationships, and just the dynamics there.

02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:28.480
And so thank you for raising those important issues today, and we appreciate it very much.

02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:47.480
Terrific. Thank you. Thanks to all of the presenters. Why don't we all join hands to thank every one of the groups and the presenters that brought these wonderful ideas to us and the very thoughtful replies to our questions, which is definitely part of the policy process.

02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:56.480
So you are well on the way. And we will be thinking about your proposals in the days to come. Thank you so much.

02:05:56.480 --> 02:06:06.480
And with that, we're going to take a break. It is 1041. We'll come back at 11 o'clock.

02:06:11.480 --> 02:06:18.480
Back. Board members, we need to reestablish a quorum, so Brooks is going to call the roll.

02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:20.480
President Darling-Hammond.

02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:49.480
Here.

02:06:49.480 --> 02:06:51.480
Everyone present.

02:06:51.480 --> 02:06:59.480
Terrific. Item four is the California Community Schools Partnership Program, or CCSPP.

02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:08.480
This item is contained, is containing three external presentations, a CDE presentation, and two action items for the board.

02:07:08.480 --> 02:07:24.480
For action, the CDE recommends that the board approve the CCSPP RTAC awards, which are the regional technical assistance centers, and that the state board approve the 2022-23 administrative plan for CCSPP.

02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:33.480
We will hear from the following three external presenters, Dr. Mark Galli and Melissa Stafford-Jones from the California Department of Health and Human Services.

02:07:33.480 --> 02:07:42.480
And then after lunch, we will hear from CCSPP State Transformational Assistance Center, the Anaheim Union High School District.

02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:49.480
That item will be presented by Steve Zimmer and Pete Callis of the CDE with an introduction by Superintendent Thurmond.

02:07:49.480 --> 02:08:00.480
Superintendent Thurmond, please begin.

02:08:00.480 --> 02:08:02.480
Thank you, Dr. Darling-Hammond.

02:08:02.480 --> 02:08:15.480
It's an honor to help to tee up this conversation on some latest updates on community schools and action that is before the board to select these regional technical assistance center leaders.

02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:32.480
It's also an honor to be able to talk about the nexus in partnership with a very important program, the Children's Behavioral Health Initiative, which many of you remember is a $4 billion initiative that allows us to address mental health in a way that we've not seen before.

02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:36.480
I like to call it the No Wrong Door Initiative.

02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:40.480
It means that young people can be supported in school or in their community.

02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:50.480
It allows us to create alignments within our systems and close gaps that have existed for a long time in how we serve folks in need of mental health support.

02:08:50.480 --> 02:09:01.480
And so it's really appropriate to be able to present these items together, the Children's Behavioral Health Initiative and our community schools initiative.

02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:20.480
As I talk about the progress of our program, as we approach the end of the first semester of our first cohort for planning and implementation, I want to remind you that our community schools program is the largest community schools initiative in the nation.

02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:35.480
Now successfully launched in our state envision more than 458 campuses who have implementation grants and 172 LEAs that have planning grants.

02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:52.480
We have before you today, as Dr. Darling-Hammond noted, our state transformative assistance team led by the Alameda County Office of Education to provide some perspective for you.

02:09:52.480 --> 02:10:00.480
You'll get to hear from the Anaheim Union High School District about their incredible community schools program.

02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:12.480
I've had the chance to visit on more than one occasion and thank Superintendent Mike Matsuda and his team who will be presenting this information for us today.

02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:20.480
Then, of course, you'll hear from Deputy Superintendent Steve Zimmer, from our Division Director Pete Callis on this work.

02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:31.480
I'd like to now turn to Secretary Mark Galli, Dr. Mark Galli and the Director of the Children's Behavioral Health Initiative, Melissa Stafford-Jones.

02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:41.480
Dr. Galli needs no introduction, a foremost pediatrician in our state appointed in 2019.

02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:51.480
You know, I would say that I've hung my hat on anything that he has said to us during the pandemic about how we keep students and families safe.

02:10:51.480 --> 02:11:03.480
But then this happened. I had the opportunity to fly with Dr. Galli to an event focusing on how we support our schools and their reopening and health and mental health.

02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:12.480
Maybe Dr. Galli will say he got stuck on the plane with me, but we flew to that destination and we flew back on a very small plane.

02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:19.480
It gave us the opportunity to sit together and talk about Dr. Galli's perspective on how we approach health and human services.

02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:27.480
It is a complete perspective. We talked about the importance of strengthening the work that we do around mental health and supports.

02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:35.480
And it was a treat for me to be able to talk with him about all things, about how we support our students, about families, about children.

02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:45.480
And it is a pleasure now to turn over the microphone for some remarks from our own Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Mark Galli.

02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:49.480
Please welcome him as he comes.

02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:54.480
Good morning, Superintendent Thurman. Thank you so much for the warm introduction.

02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:59.480
And I remember that back and forth trip to Monterey.

02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:13.480
We actually ended up meeting up with President Darling-Hammond at a wonderful event at an elementary school where we saw so many important programs

02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:19.480
re-ignited, reinstituted in the wake of closures and the pandemic.

02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:32.480
And just a tremendous chance to see what I think are the elements of community schools in action and touring with the governor and the two leaders here.

02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:37.480
Just really a treat to have a chance to be there to the board.

02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:50.480
Thank you for taking some time inviting me and Melissa Stafford-Jones to make a brief presentation and hopefully leave a lot of time for dialogue and questions and the conversation.

02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:56.480
I'm going to do what I normally don't do very well, which is share a screen.

02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:03.480
Let me get that set up first and then see if we can.

02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:07.480
OK.

02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:18.480
One moment.

02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:22.480
All right. Are you all able to see the full screen?

02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:24.480
We are. Great. OK.

02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:27.480
It's dangerous when they let a secretary drive the Zoom screen.

02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:30.480
Normally doesn't happen.

02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:32.480
So like I said, really privileged to be here.

02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:34.480
Thank you for the invitation.

02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:41.480
Be honest, in a week, I have a privilege of giving dozens of presentations about a whole bunch of different issues.

02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:53.480
This is one that I've been anticipating for quite some time because in the sort of throws of this whole movement around behavioral health for young people,

02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:58.480
it is hard to imagine the health field carrying it by itself.

02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:00.480
And no one expects that.

02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:09.480
But the importance of our conversation today on the heels of lots of work with partners in the education community across our state,

02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:18.480
I think it's so important for me to emphasize to all of you what a privilege it is to be here with you to engage on this,

02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:23.480
to see where there's opportunities, where there's maybe a rock we haven't flipped over yet,

02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:34.480
to really uncover and discover what more we can do for young people to support them through their youth into productive adulthood.

02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:46.480
So what we know about mental health in this crisis in California and across our nation are it's hard to summarize it with just data.

02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:50.480
I think the personal experiences probably speak louder.

02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:56.480
But now it's the leading cause for hospitalization in California for young people under 18.

02:14:56.480 --> 02:15:02.480
I can tell you stories in Los Angeles where on every long weekend,

02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:13.480
I was tasked with finding placements for young people who are stuck in emergency rooms on 5150 danger to self danger to others because we had nowhere to go.

02:15:13.480 --> 02:15:16.480
Those weren't issues that happened over that long weekend.

02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:22.480
They'd been brewing for weeks, months before, and they culminate in the emergency room.

02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:29.480
And I say on long weekends because we could always handle a one day or a two day lull in the system.

02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:35.480
But that third day seemed to break the whole system all across the state.

02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:46.480
You all probably know that one in three Californians in middle school and nearly half of 11th graders are reporting being chronically sad.

02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:59.480
We know the impact is disparate on different populations and LGBTQ youth reporting feeling sad or hopeless and usually stopping some activities at two thirds.

02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:08.480
So you can see and know that this is a crisis of really epic proportions across our nation.

02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:13.480
We also know that it's important to think about prevention and early intervention.

02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:23.480
Half of diagnosable mental illness begins by the time kids are 14 and 75 percent by the age of 24.

02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:30.480
We see some of the most extreme manifestations of severe mental health in adulthood.

02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:37.480
But really, their evidence, their initial symptoms can be traced to childhood.

02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:41.480
Fifty percent of young people in our juvenile justice systems have mental health needs.

02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:46.480
I can tell you this from firsthand experience as a pediatrician in L.A.

02:16:46.480 --> 02:17:14.480
I primarily worked in our foster care system in South Los Angeles, as well as the various holes in camps as part of the juvenile justice system and had a chance to see hundreds, thousands of youth over my time who were struggling with diagnosed and undiagnosed behavioral health conditions rooted in the circumstances in their community and lives and others that were manifestations of that first psychotic break that happened to just about every one of us.

02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:18.480
There's not any family that you could imagine.

02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:25.480
So seeing this and really pinpointing this as a big important issue in the juvenile justice system is important.

02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:42.480
We know that the detection and intervention on mental health and behavioral health conditions and I say behavioral health to acknowledge the crisis we have with substance use disorders, especially among our adolescent students,

02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:56.480
whether it's the issues with fentanyl and opiates or other drugs and alcohol that we know wreak havoc on the lives of young people and their academic and life success all the time.

02:17:56.480 --> 02:18:12.480
And then this point, which I think is a milestone for us on the primary health care side, which is this real recognition over the last many years that in order for us to more effectively address the children's behavioral health crisis,

02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:30.480
we need to ensure that we're continuing to build our roots in bringing together the behavioral health systems and the primary care systems to address early issues of depression, anxiety, and other behavioral health issues in childhood.

02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:47.480
So Superintendent Thurmond referenced already that we in the administration have had a very fine important point of focus on children and youth behavioral health.

02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:54.480
It culminated in some very important actions, but these are not things that came up in a week or a month.

02:18:54.480 --> 02:19:03.480
They were really efforts that have a long tail and areas where we've been long concerned about how we can do a better job.

02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:14.480
So in August, the governor doubled down with the first partner in the Central Valley, the announcement of the master plan for kids mental health.

02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:30.480
This is probably more than $4.7 billion if you add all the threads, but certainly at least $4.7 billion that is looking to support the mental health and substance use services for young people under the age of 25.

02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:45.480
So there's an early childhood learning component here. There's obviously a K through 12 component, and then there's a higher ed component each getting their special attention and focus, but all taken as equal high priorities.

02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:58.480
They lead with the whole child approach. I appreciate the point that the superintendent makes about the no wrong door, every door works approach, which is really what we want to make sure is available.

02:19:58.480 --> 02:20:11.480
This is multi year. It's not one year or a few years of funding, and there's about nearly a half a billion dollars that is ongoing through the various health systems that serve young people.

02:20:11.480 --> 02:20:18.480
And it really represents a fundamental overhaul in the infrastructure available to young people.

02:20:19.480 --> 02:20:31.480
Building on what we have today, but certainly filling a whole host of gaps and the Children Youth Behavioral Health Initiative, which I will focus on in a moment is a core to this master plan.

02:20:31.480 --> 02:21:00.480
It's not the only piece, as you see below, community schools, the Medi-Cal Cal AIM initiative, which begins to, for Medicaid families, integrate health and behavioral health really pays attention to those who are system involved young people, whether it's the child welfare system or the juvenile justice system, allowing you to sort of essentially immediately be eligible for behavioral health services, for which in the past you needed to be able to do that.

02:21:00.480 --> 02:21:17.480
In the past, you needed to be screened and deemed eligible through a medical provider. So Cal AIM, I'm sure many of you have heard about portions of it, but it does fundamentally reform how behavioral health is managed, not just for kids, but adults as well.

02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:29.480
We've had some very important aspects for children, and then we can't have a conversation about anything in health today, especially on the heels of the pandemic without focusing on the workforce.

02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:50.480
The explosion of need and demand on behavioral health has really squarely put the gaps of capacity and workforce capacity in specific in California front and center, and the governor and the legislature made $1.4 billion of explicit investments in the healthcare workforce.

02:21:50.480 --> 02:21:59.480
But there are many, many more dollars that are intended to help beef up and build up fill gaps, the behavioral health workforce across our state.

02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:21.480
So what is the Children Youth Behavioral Health Initiative? We call it CYBHI. It's a mouthful as an acronym or as a name, but it is, as I said, a historic five-year investment, initially of $4.4 billion, and at the very basic, it's meant to transform all the ways that we support young people.

02:22:21.480 --> 02:22:44.480
It focuses on promoting mental, emotional, and behavioral health. It has a serious focus on prevention. We want to get upstream. The initial conversations that went into the CYBHI were really about how we, like in so many areas of health, wait too long to start serving people.

02:22:44.480 --> 02:23:09.480
That we know the data that I shared with you on the first slide, that half of behavioral health conditions manifest by the age of 14, that full 75% in adolescents and young adulthood, and that we, knowing that, need to do more to be further upstream and be where young people are, be where their families are, be in their communities.

02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:23.480
That this is not just about the point where we have a diagnosis, but this is really about supporting and providing screening or assessment to all young people. This is a big task.

02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:52.480
I remember when I was speaking to the governor about it, he said, are you sure you want to go after all young people? And I said, there's no other way to do it, right? There's no other way to build a system for California's youngest citizens without focusing on all of them because behavioral health, although there's disparate impacts on some groups, it is an issue in an area that affects every young person, every family, every community, every school.

02:23:52.480 --> 02:24:09.480
And we wanted to take in the vein of the governor's California for all a true all children, all young people approach. And then, although this is about lifting all boats, we know that some boats will need more lifting than others.

02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:36.480
So addressing the inequities for groups disproportionately impacted is an important issue focusing on the systemic barriers to well-being, what those are, whether it's issues around the digital divide or the attributes of community health systems, or what we hope to have a conversation about what schools might need to address those inequities in behavioral health.

02:24:36.480 --> 02:25:04.480
Broadly speaking, we're all interested in CYBHI to focus their anchored inequity. I think we are most concerned about ensuring that we take down the silos that have for so long existed between health schools and other systems that impact young people so that we can deliver on this promise that the governor laid out just about a year and a half ago.

02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:30.480
So, as I said, I was super excited about this presentation in part because, and Linda knows this, and I even maybe shared some of these stories with Tony. When I first exited residency and worked in the Bayview Hunters Point community, I spent a lot of time in the lives of my patients, didn't live far away from Bayview.

02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:52.480
But certainly the experiences of that community, any of you who know it, were radically different than those in the rest of the city. And I spent a lot of time with the families and the young people that I had the privilege of taking care of, and in fact, spent a lot of time in their schools.

02:25:52.480 --> 02:26:13.480
I remember being on the small blue chairs in first-kinder, second-grade classrooms talking about primarily young boys of color, primarily black boys in Bayview who were being kicked out of class because of, quote, behavioral issues.

02:26:13.480 --> 02:26:35.480
And I appreciated the challenges of the school and the teacher and always came with sort of brain and heart of how do we help support not just this young person, but the school and these dedicated educators on serving the needs, not just of the patient I have, but frankly, the whole classroom.

02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:55.480
And sitting through whether it was IEP meetings or other brainstorms with that school and the educators and the leaders in that school quickly and for a long time discovered how important the alignment of our efforts to support young people are.

02:26:55.480 --> 02:27:22.480
And that didn't change for me in Los Angeles. I shared a little bit about my experience in the juvenile detention centers, but that also had a great opportunity to work with our county office of education who were delivering the education services in the juvenile halls and camps and having a chance to talk about both the behavioral health, the mental health, the other health challenges.

02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:36.480
And found that those relationships and those opportunities often led to the shared goals being sort of manifest and discussed between education and health.

02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:58.480
And for far too long, I think the health system has seen this opportunity to, and I'm going to use a word leverage, leverage the education system and the schools where kids are to get our work done, whether it was health screenings or actually having health services delivered in schools.

02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:15.480
When it comes to behavioral health, though, I think there is a real opportunity to talk about how schools and the education community can better leverage us on health to help meet the needs that are more and more evident in the classroom.

02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:36.480
And one of the parts of this conversation that I'm most interested in is hearing all of your ideas for how that leverage becomes manifest where there's opportunities for deeper partnership and conversation so that we both take our approach with whole child in mind.

02:28:36.480 --> 02:29:01.480
The opportunity around community schools, this epic opportunity with the Children Youth Behavioral Health Initiative, the focus by elected leaders, including the governor and the first partner on investing in behavioral health and really, frankly, drive a truck through this opportunity together so that we can better focus on the young people's needs that we know.

02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:06.480
Frankly, are we're failing to meet at least as it comes to behavioral health.

02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:20.480
So I'm going to just quickly fly through a few more slides to get us to the conversation component here. But over the next five years, these are the sort of bullets that explain what we're focused on.

02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:41.480
We're focused on, like I said, really reimagining the entire ecosystem, focusing on prevention and early intervention, talking about reducing stigma, focusing on awareness, catalyzing that alignment and coordination between the health systems that often take care of young people towards

02:29:41.480 --> 02:30:07.480
The sort of the more severe end of the spectrum of disorders and needs, but also coordinating with communities and schools and other entities where young people are focusing on the workforce workforce workforce can't say enough and making sure that we pay attention to the lack of diversity and the need to increase not just

02:30:07.480 --> 02:30:27.480
The the the ethnic diversity of the workforce, but ensuring that all young people, no matter what they're facing and dealing with have somebody in the workforce that can relate to them benefiting from some of the important innovations that we saw scaled during the pandemic on

02:30:27.480 --> 02:30:38.480
Virtual care and telehealth and using all of these to put together a system that I hope really does meet the needs of young people in the years to come.

02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:49.480
There's four areas of focus here. We talked about the behavioral health ecosystem and the infrastructure. We talked about ensuring that coverage architecture makes sense.

02:30:49.480 --> 02:31:08.480
And it's so easy for the state to focus just on medical and Medicaid and the opportunities there. But if we're really going to have an all children, all young people approach, we can't ignore the need to align with the commercial health systems and to ensure that those with private or employer

02:31:08.480 --> 02:31:13.480
sponsored insurance have the same

02:31:13.480 --> 02:31:24.480
Access to and ability to receive the benefits of some of these programs workforce again and then public awareness.

02:31:24.480 --> 02:31:38.480
I like to think that one day soon, just as young students have no shame, no issue, no concern to raise their hand to say, you know, I need to go to my doctor or dentist appointment.

02:31:38.480 --> 02:31:57.480
Similarly, young person as the courage, the security, the understanding to be able to be in an environment where standing up and saying, I'm going to seek support and help for a behavioral health issue or

02:31:57.480 --> 02:32:10.480
participate in wellness activities that it's seen in the same light as a routine regular part of how we ensure young people are well taken care of in our state.

02:32:10.480 --> 02:32:17.480
So I'm not going to spend a lot of time here. I'm going to skip to the next slide pretty quickly because this is dizzying in some ways.

02:32:17.480 --> 02:32:29.480
Melissa is on she can help fill in some of the gaps, but this slide really just shows the 14 general areas of focus. We have 14 work streams, each one is

02:32:29.480 --> 02:32:38.480
Connected but independent. They focus and fall under these four header areas that I shared on the previous slide.

02:32:38.480 --> 02:32:54.480
And together, these are the elements of transformation. These are the elements of partnership and these are going to be the tools that if made widely available at scale and robust enough could really help transform the

02:32:54.480 --> 02:33:09.480
Experience young people have both in preventing and focusing on wellness and also accessing the services they need when those initial services aren't enough.

02:33:09.480 --> 02:33:28.480
So partnering with schools to support well-being. I think CYBHI just want to highlight a few things. I mentioned the behavioral health workforce investments. I'm going to spend the last couple of slides talking about the new behavioral health coach role that some of you may have heard about, but I'm excited to share a little bit more.

02:33:28.480 --> 02:33:38.480
Building infrastructure through schooling partnerships. I use the word school linked very deliberately. Often people want to focus on school based.

02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:52.480
But having shared a little bit of my experience in schools, I know that it's challenging to find the space to find the time to find the resources to be able to do everything on a school campus.

02:33:52.480 --> 02:34:06.480
And some schools maybe have that capability today. Others, maybe not. So if we're trying to create a equitable system across the state, we can't depend on everything done for a young person.

02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:24.480
Maybe it's appropriately done at a school, but we don't have the capacity to do so. So how do we make sure that they're at least school linked and ensure that this linkage is robust, that it doesn't mean that it's harder or less likely to happen, that a young person can access those services.

02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:44.480
So this piece is really critical, I think, to understanding CYBHI's intent to work with schools. Yes, we want to figure out what might be where there's opportunities when it's appropriate to have resources on site, but if that's not possible, it doesn't mean that there's not a strong opportunity for partnership.

02:34:45.480 --> 02:35:09.480
Scaling evidence-based and community-defined practices with an emphasis on equity. This is key. California, more than any other state, has the opportunity to not just have emerging practices embedded in our systems, but really create and develop the evidence to scale things that are working in one place and bringing them to others.

02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:23.480
So this learning community, their opportunities, I think are, I want to say, endless. I think there's a lot that we have yet to do that really is an opportunity for us moving forward.

02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:47.480
Supporting partnerships between Medi-Cal, so much of what we do in Cal HHS, even though we think broadly about health and human services and those social services, because of the way the federal government has set up Medi-Cal or Medicaid, there's a lot of opportunity to use it as one of our primary equity tools for low-income communities.

02:35:47.480 --> 02:36:16.480
So this year, through some programs through the Department of Health Care Services, supporting these partnerships through the Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans, 23 of them across the state, working with LEAs and districts across the states and county offices of education, to really come up with collaborative approaches, real programs that can be used in a variety of ways.

02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:32.480
And that could further the mission of Medi-Cal by engaging and partnering with our school partners. This, to me, is a real manifestation of what we can do together using the resources that are made available through Medi-Cal.

02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:53.480
Cal Hope Student Services, I think I hope many of you have benefited from this. Cal Hope was something that we created in the throes of the pandemic for all Californians, primarily focused on adults, but the urgency of the needs for young people created Cal Hope for kids and youth.

02:36:53.480 --> 02:37:14.480
And now has really become something where there's more of a learning community, a coalescence of, I think, hundreds of educators and education leaders talking and thinking about how we develop the tools to support schools for social-emotional learning, something that we're excited to continue to build on.

02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:42.480
The funding alluded to in the next bullet around wellness, mindfulness, and resilience of students, really imagining that those dollars are made available to LEAs through sort of the Cal Hope model, if you will, to make sure those dollars are well mobilized across our state to support districts in implementing those wellness and mindfulness programs.

02:37:42.480 --> 02:37:52.480
There's, of course, a focus on training from informed care, training done by the Office of the Surgeon General to educators, schools, and child care providers.

02:37:52.480 --> 02:38:10.480
And then this last point, probably dull, probably easy to overlook, but really one of the key secret weapons of the entire Children's Youth Behavioral Health Initiative, as I said, supernatural, more frankly easier to just focus on Medicaid.

02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:27.480
But part of what we worked with with the plans in the commercial space with the legislature was to make sure that what we could provide in schools linked to schools for young people on Medicaid was promised to also be provided by the commercial health plan.

02:38:27.480 --> 02:38:44.480
So we are actively working on creating a statewide fee schedule so that the different services, the different programs that could be school linked actually come with a reimbursement rate that all plans agree to reimburse moving forward.

02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:50.480
This does not happen overnight. It will take a couple of years, frankly, to get it up and running and implemented.

02:38:50.480 --> 02:39:07.480
But moving forward, this is exactly the kind of tool that we need to make sure that we don't just create something that lasts a few years, but that we have a sort of pathway to continue having the resources to support these important programs.

02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:26.480
This is just to show a slide that yes, we're focusing on outcomes and goals. This is a draft set. I don't expect anyone to sort of really ingest this now, but Melissa and her team are engaging lots of stakeholders, including educators on what these outcomes and goals should be.

02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:48.480
How do we make sure we have access to the data and the information to track towards them? Because an initiative like this doesn't come about very often, and the ability to demonstrate its value in the transformation of the lives of young people, families, and communities is going to be key to maintaining this moving forward.

02:39:48.480 --> 02:40:09.480
Before I go any further, we have been very deliberate to list the various departments in Cal HHS who work on this initiative. The Department of Health Care Services, Health Care Access and Information Department, formerly known as OSHPD.

02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:21.480
They do a lot of our workforce work. The Department of Managed Health Care, who oversees the commercial and Medicaid managed care plans, helping us specifically in the areas of the fee schedule.

02:40:21.480 --> 02:40:49.480
The Department of Public Health focused primarily on awareness and stigma engagement, and then the Office of the Surgeon General, their work on ACEs and the focus on ACE screening has really set themselves up well to help us focus on the trauma-informed educator tools and building out that whole suite of services.

02:40:49.480 --> 02:41:14.480
So unlike most of the things that we do at the state where it's one agency, one department within that agency, this is really starting out cross-cutting across our agency, and if you put the tentacles to so many other partners, including you at the state board, the Department of Education, we see this as really an incredible collaborative opportunity.

02:41:15.480 --> 02:41:29.480
So in one or two minutes, I just wanted to say that one of the most innovative parts of this whole initiative is a focus on the behavioral health coach role. This is not something in California that we have today.

02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:58.480
It's frankly not a role that anyone across the nation has. This is a recognition that we have a serious behavioral health workforce crisis, that if we're going to meet the needs of young Californians, frankly Californians anywhere of any age or location, we're going to need to not just double down on what we already have, whether those are social workers or other therapists and counselors or psychiatrists or nurse practitioners and PAs.

02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:19.480
But we're going to have to create some new roles as well, roles that are maybe even a little bit in greater reach for people in communities that allow us to tap into the diversity of both experience and interest across our state.

02:42:19.480 --> 02:42:48.480
So the behavioral health coach role is something that HCI through their workforce initiatives is putting together. They participated in dozens, I think somewhere between 50 and 100 stakeholder meetings, getting input on what this role can look like, how it fits into the community continuum that we already have, including with schools, how it fits into the school infrastructure and staffing approaches.

02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:59.480
It isn't meant in any way to supplant or replace what we already have. As I said earlier, we need more, not figure out ways to do things differently.

02:42:59.480 --> 02:43:21.480
But this is a really important opportunity, I think, to bring in folks who we often talk about peers, that sort of notion of near peers with some strong education and support and supervision to do the work that I think I know and I expect many of you know our young people need.

02:43:21.480 --> 02:43:46.480
Here are some of the services that they will provide wellness, promotion and education. They'll participate in screening, care coordination, extension of services, individual supports, imagining that the behavioral health coaches may be able to do a virtual group and support a group of young people who maybe aren't even at the same school or in the same community, but share some common experience.

02:43:46.480 --> 02:44:04.480
And then, of course, crisis referral, which will require a good bit of training, but also something that we need more of, more antennas up, and then some additional competencies that will be built in to the education approach for these behavioral health coaches.

02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:20.480
So I'm going to stop sharing and turn it back to you. I know that was quite a bit of information. I never say it as fast as I wish I could, because I really do want to engage in the dialogue.

02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:44.480
And both Melissa and I are available for additional clarification, answer any questions, but really hope to have some back and forth with you to understand how this might better fit in to the plans and opportunities that you see as we all work together on that whole child, every child counts approach.

02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:50.480
So, Linda, I don't know if I'm turning it back to you, but thanks again for the privilege of presenting to you.

02:44:50.480 --> 02:45:13.480
We're so pleased to have you. And I just want to start by thanking you for your leadership in this, both in the sort of comprehensiveness of this approach and the fact that it is being designed to be so integrated and coherent, you know, with schools where children spend so much of their lives and where we want, you know,

02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:29.480
both to be better informed about trauma informed and healing oriented care, which is part of the plan and where we want schools, of course, to produce less trauma, as well as to be able to respond to it.

02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:36.480
So I would love to start off with one question, then I'll turn it to my board colleagues as well.

02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:52.480
One of the things I think is so there's so much potential here for that we have not always been able to have before is a cross communication between mental health professionals who have a body of knowledge about trauma informed care and many other things.

02:45:52.480 --> 02:46:13.480
And education professionals who have a body of knowledge increasingly about social and emotional learning programs, about restorative practices, which we've got a new study at LPI coming up shows the more restorative practices kids experience, the better their mental health outcomes, the less depression, the less suicidal ideation and so on.

02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:31.480
So we want to be able to share those with the, you know, the connective tissue to the mental health so that we have professionals talking with each other with a common understanding of what each of them can do to reinforce the efforts of the other.

02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:46.480
And I just wonder if you've been thinking about or have some beginning ideas for how we could structure this in a way that communication and shared practice could be developed.

02:46:46.480 --> 02:47:04.480
So I think a couple of thoughts and then open it up to the group and Melissa as well. Two things come to mind. One thing I glossed over that is a core component is this virtual platform that is going to be the anchor of everything we do.

02:47:04.480 --> 02:47:33.480
It's slated to receive hundreds of millions of dollars to create. It's meant to be the front door to the entire initiative. And it's meant to be used by young people, by caregivers and guardians and parents, and by educators to really engage with real tools that allow us to begin serving the needs that maybe are under addressed for a young person that you have in the classroom or in the community or family.

02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:55.480
And we hope that it's a widely used tool. We're creating it and tailoring it so that it's sort of created by youth for youth in as many ways as we possibly can. But that becomes a very real time place where I think we'll have a lot of cross exchange of ideas and opportunities to learn from one another.

02:47:55.480 --> 02:48:15.480
I mentioned the work that we have launched with the managed care plans and really creating partnerships between those entities. And you might say, well, why the managed care plans? Because frankly, they're the ones who drive Medicaid. They're the ones who start with the funding for Medicaid and they have the resources.

02:48:15.480 --> 02:48:42.480
And so providers in the community where that plan works or overseas, they're going to really respond to the wishes of the plan and engage. So I think that becomes a table, those tables that are actively being created between plans and providers on the one hand, and LEAs and districts and schools on the other hand,

02:48:42.480 --> 02:49:08.480
become a place where I think we can have that communication angle. We had one tool that will be created as part of the initiative as well is what we called an e-consult system. And as I mentioned before, as a primary care pediatrician, I could engage with specialists across the state or across my community through a collaborative,

02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:27.480
what they call asynchronous approach to getting information to how to serve the patient in front of me or the student in front of you. And I think that this became a really two way communication opportunity focused on a real life situation that had immediate impact.

02:49:27.480 --> 02:49:47.480
And so I think we have opportunities at the very high level to continue to bring each other together, but I'm really excited about how we create more tools to have sharing of information around specific, I call them patients, you might call them students, but young people wherever that we're seeing them.

02:49:47.480 --> 02:49:52.480
So I think CYBHI creates those two opportunities at that level.

02:49:52.480 --> 02:50:21.480
And, you know, I think beyond, I think those are great ideas and beyond the level of the individual student or patient, if we can communicate about the practices that are school wide, and the ways in which those support students generally and are available for specific cases, you know, that would create healthy environments that, you know, increasingly healthy environments that are part of the ultimate plan.

02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:35.480
Ultimate puzzle. I see that member Escobedo, member Orozco Gonzalez, both have questions or comments. And member Olkins, so let's get them on the table. I know, Mark, I'm told that you have a hard stop at noon, is that right?

02:50:35.480 --> 02:50:42.480
I'm going to, I'm just texting to move and get another 10 minutes. If you all have it, I'm willing to stay till about 10 after.

02:50:42.480 --> 02:50:46.480
Well, by virtue of the number of hands that are up, I think we could use that.

02:50:46.480 --> 02:50:51.480
Yeah, that'd be great. Member Escobedo.

02:50:51.480 --> 02:51:08.480
Very quick. I applaud the work on changing the architectural coverage. Any thoughts about changing the architecture of a clinic or the hospital, namely having mental health services within the area of care.

02:51:08.480 --> 02:51:31.480
For example, in the San Ysidro Health Clinic, where my students used to go for dental health, the therapist was right next door. And even it was a subtle yet powerful message that, you know, mental health is part of taking care of the whole child.

02:51:31.480 --> 02:51:35.480
So, just any thoughts about that?

02:51:35.480 --> 02:51:54.480
Well, I mean, first off, I think your illustration is key, right? We want behavioral health to sort of be seamless and around students, just like you mentioned dental care, I think about the primary pediatric experience, making sure it's there.

02:51:54.480 --> 02:52:09.480
I think we have some work to do in making sure that clinics like San Ysidro and other FQHCs have the ability to, you know, bill or receive payment for those services.

02:52:09.480 --> 02:52:30.480
So that's a whole different conversation that we're active with federally qualified health centers and others. But I think as we've seen in other areas of medicine, if the funding and the billing becomes more seamless and straightforward, suddenly the models and services exist.

02:52:30.480 --> 02:52:51.480
So that's one thing. The other thing that I think is really important, and we're in this struggle right now, is that I often say, especially with behavioral health, we have to get out of the clinics, we have to get out of the hospital because so much of what we seek to do is really anchored in communities.

02:52:51.480 --> 02:53:13.480
And, you know, schools as communities, I know we talk a lot about community schools, but schools as communities, I think, really understanding where there's an opportunity. So as we transform what it looks like within the four walls of clinics and hospitals and other places, I'm also, and frankly, even more excited about thinking about what it looks like to get the show on the road.

02:53:13.480 --> 02:53:22.480
Awesome. Member Roscoe Gonzalez, and then I have member Olken, Patil Bronson, Glover Woods.

02:53:22.480 --> 02:53:35.480
I know it's quite a bit and it just seems like two very different worlds are colliding in terms of preschool to 12th grade education and health and human services.

02:53:36.480 --> 02:53:44.480
There is a prime opportunity for deeper levels of coordination and engagement between the community schools initiative and the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative.

02:53:44.480 --> 02:53:57.480
So my question to you is, what needs to happen to ensure we take advantage of this opportunity to leverage the resources and expertise to the benefit of our students, educators and communities?

02:53:57.480 --> 02:54:09.480
Well, I think that conversations like the one we're having today and really making it a priority so that I know for me and Melissa can vouch for this, it's a leadership priority.

02:54:09.480 --> 02:54:22.480
There is a lot of, I'm going to say, missed opportunity, things we've left on the table in the past because the partnerships haven't been as deep and candid as they need to be.

02:54:22.480 --> 02:54:34.480
And when the superintendent talks about our plane ride back and forth, some of the plane conversation was about where there's real opportunities and where we haven't capitalized on it.

02:54:34.480 --> 02:54:44.480
So I think one thing is making sure that the board, that I as the governor has, the superintendent, others, that we continue to prioritize.

02:54:44.480 --> 02:54:49.480
Let's not figure this out on our own because we can't. I don't think we can.

02:54:49.480 --> 02:54:56.480
But then we're going to really create the force function of bringing people together around the tables that Linda's asking about.

02:54:56.480 --> 02:55:04.480
And I'm sure many of you are asking about. We have the start for some of that. I think we have the leaders who are absolutely interested.

02:55:04.480 --> 02:55:24.480
But I worry that as new things come up that we lose the focus and emphasis. And that's why I would love to have this be an annual conversation or a biannual conversation where we are coming together with you to say, how are we doing on creating those tables?

02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:36.480
And where are we still missing opportunity? Because as I said, Medicaid is this amazing tool and the commercial insurance world is this amazing tool to create the resources to do some of the things I think we all want to do for kids.

02:55:36.480 --> 02:55:42.480
I see Melissa has popped up. Did you want to add something, Melissa?

02:55:42.480 --> 02:55:59.480
Thank you so much, President Arlenham. I just wanted to note that I'm just really appreciative and grateful that CYBHI and Cal HHS have also had the opportunity to be meeting regularly with SBE and CDE staff and leadership on these issues.

02:55:59.480 --> 02:56:12.480
So we are like rolling up our sleeves and digging in and thinking about, okay, well, where are the key intersection points between CYBHI and community schools or expanded learning? What might the behavioral health coach will look like there?

02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:25.480
How can the virtual services platform connect? What are those opportunities? So we still have much work to do, but I just wanted to express my appreciation and gratitude for the partnership effort that I've already started.

02:56:25.480 --> 02:56:40.480
This conversation is reminding me of a school I worked closely with in East Palo Alto where there was a lot of trauma that kids experienced and we had a relationship with Stanford Child Psychiatry Unit.

02:56:40.480 --> 02:57:05.480
And so the interns and residents were able to come over and meet with students regularly in groups, you know, for group therapy as well as individually, and then be in part of the faculty meetings to talk about the various strategies that both the school and the professionals could, the mental health professionals could jointly be aware of and engage in.

02:57:05.480 --> 02:57:15.480
And then if we can get to a place where that's the kind of integration that schools can experience, I think the benefits are just enormous.

02:57:15.480 --> 02:57:19.480
Member Olken, you are next in queue.

02:57:19.480 --> 02:57:28.480
Thank you. I want to first just say thank you so much for all this work and for sharing your time and expertise with us.

02:57:28.480 --> 02:57:46.480
I think any of us who work in education have always really seen the important connection between student well-being and student academic success, and the pandemic just made that so much more evident and important and on all of our minds.

02:57:46.480 --> 02:57:49.480
So this feels so well-timed.

02:57:49.480 --> 02:58:15.480
And I just had a couple of thoughts and questions. So the first one is, I just want to say I love the behavioral coach model. And as I'm thinking about people with whom I work at my schools, who I could see incredible school staff wanting to like taking up that opportunity as a,

02:58:15.480 --> 02:58:24.480
for increased learning and then perhaps as a career growth opportunity in a way that already builds on what they bring to our school.

02:58:24.480 --> 02:58:36.480
And so I think that's amazing. Along those lines, Linda mentioned the importance of restorative practices, and this is just a small piece.

02:58:36.480 --> 02:58:55.480
In that description of the competencies for that role, I would love for restorative practices to be part of it. I think that's such an important part of what that person or that role could bring in terms of expertise for a school site.

02:58:55.480 --> 02:59:21.480
So that's that piece. And then earlier this morning, we heard presentations from the Student Advisory Board on Education, and one of the groups was on mental health, and their recommendation was that we should invest in peer support, peer mental health coaches and supports.

02:59:21.480 --> 02:59:47.480
And I thought it was an interesting one too, you know, first of their, what they brought to us and then what you brought to us. And I just wondered about the ways in which we could think about supporting students to become supports to each other as a way to perhaps

02:59:47.480 --> 02:59:58.480
focus on that might be a bridge for public awareness and the stigmatization. That's one of those four principles. And then another one is even workforce training and capacity.

02:59:58.480 --> 03:00:19.480
Because I think the more our young people see schools as places where their expertise and what they bring to the table as being important, the more likely they are to want to pursue a career in education or in mental health.

03:00:19.480 --> 03:00:39.480
And so I think there's a real link there. We could start getting young people on the path early and that would, based on the diversity of our schools, perhaps help us diversify the field as well, which is really important. So just some thoughts and I'm so excited. Thank you.

03:00:39.480 --> 03:01:00.480
Can I just respond really quickly? I think the second piece is something we, there was a small part of this past budget that focused on engagement, especially diverse young students in getting them prepared for fields in behavioral health.

03:01:00.480 --> 03:01:20.480
And there may be a nexus there to really think about how we amplify that and build that with the behavioral health coach model. Melissa, I'm sure, has some ideas there as well. We've been talking about the peer versus near peer difference and how does that look and feel.

03:01:20.480 --> 03:01:44.480
So I think this is right for a conversation where we'd love to get your feedback about what would best work in a school environment. Where is it a good idea? Maybe where is it not as good as an idea? That's where your expertise certainly could influence how we look at this moving forward. So appreciate the point and see that as another place of opportunity and collaboration.

03:01:44.480 --> 03:01:51.480
Terrific. Vice President Clever-Woods and then I have member McCullin, Patil Bronson and Rodriguez.

03:01:51.480 --> 03:02:07.480
Thank you. And thank you so much for the presentation. I think anytime we see true and authentic collaboration and integration amongst all of our different agencies for the support of students, it's absolutely wonderful.

03:02:07.480 --> 03:02:17.480
And I'm quite encouraged that the community schools program is actually a great model of what that can possibly look like.

03:02:17.480 --> 03:02:31.480
I was also very encouraged around the idea of diversifying the behavioral health workforce, just as we're looking at how to better diversify the teaching workforce that interacts with our children every day.

03:02:31.480 --> 03:02:43.480
A thought that I had, and it may be something that's already being explored, is perhaps finding an integration point with our CTE programs as well.

03:02:43.480 --> 03:02:58.480
We do have, as many of you are already aware, that health services sector and there is a specific pathway related to behavioral and I'm looking at it right now, mental and behavioral health.

03:02:58.480 --> 03:03:20.480
And as we're thinking about the behavioral health coaches and again just diversifying the workforce as a whole in multiple positions, integrating and connecting with the CTE programs in the schools might be a wonderful way to bring more students into the fold from more diverse backgrounds.

03:03:20.480 --> 03:03:28.480
So that's a great thought and just to deconstruct our acronyms, that's our career technical education.

03:03:28.480 --> 03:03:35.480
I was just going to ask, but terrific. You have your acronyms and we have ours.

03:03:35.480 --> 03:03:58.480
Yeah, I'm terrible at defining ours. One important point that I don't think people hear enough, but this was recently surveyed again, but four out of five Americans believe that behavioral health is a bigger and bigger and more important and a grave issue in our country.

03:03:58.480 --> 03:04:12.480
And four out of five surveyed individuals believe that it's not just the responsibility of the health system to focus on. They see a role for community, they see a role for family members, they see a role for neighbors.

03:04:12.480 --> 03:04:35.480
So how do we take that idea and really amplify it in a community school model or any other model that you all think might make sense? And I think that concept is at the belly of the Children Youth Behavioral Health Initiative and I think amplifies this idea of diversity in the workforce.

03:04:35.480 --> 03:04:50.480
I think I'm going to get it not entirely right, but 75% of the need is among people of color and 70% of the workforce is white in California in the behavioral health space.

03:04:50.480 --> 03:04:59.480
So we have a real gap. We have a real need to focus on diversity if we're going to really pay attention to some of these equity issues that we're talking about.

03:04:59.480 --> 03:05:05.480
And this notion of starting to think about these various pathways and on-ramps is really exciting.

03:05:05.480 --> 03:05:07.480
Melissa, did you want to add something?

03:05:07.480 --> 03:05:19.480
Yes, thanks so much, President Darling-Hammond. I just wanted to note that actually Deputy Superintendent Zimmer raised this issue with me and with our colleagues at the Department of Health Care Access and Information. I think it was this summer.

03:05:19.480 --> 03:05:31.480
And actually they've started some meetings and conversations about the intersection of CTE with the Career Pathways programs that we have that HCI is leading under the Children Youth Behavioral Health Initiative and beyond.

03:05:31.480 --> 03:05:42.480
Because we also have Career Pathways programs that reach into high schools as well as colleges. So there is some conversation that's been started about where those connection points might be. So we appreciate that being raised.

03:05:42.480 --> 03:05:45.480
Terrific. Member McQuillin.

03:05:46.480 --> 03:05:56.480
Thank you. And thank you for this very rich conversation. Dr. Mark, there was a lot in your presentation there to unwrap. Thank you for that.

03:05:56.480 --> 03:06:07.480
You know, there's so much we need to do in terms of breaking down the silos between our systems and in education itself.

03:06:07.480 --> 03:06:24.480
You know, we often run into, you know, that it's not my responsibility to touch on mental health or social emotional. That's the health class that deals with that. We still have some of that work to be done to bringing down those silos.

03:06:24.480 --> 03:06:38.480
But I wanted to, and I appreciate all of it in terms of recruitment and definitely the CTE. I sit on that subcommittee with the with the members of the California Chancellor's Board.

03:06:38.480 --> 03:06:52.480
And we need to raise that up in terms of helping to make sure that's a louder message out there that the health pathways are a part of CTE and it can be funded and supported there for that recruitment.

03:06:52.480 --> 03:07:12.480
But I wanted to go back to I appreciate the school link linked services, not school based services and that that distinction you made there in terms of funding and accessing those school link services to zero in on continuing funding for the support services.

03:07:12.480 --> 03:07:25.480
And do you see any other hurdles that we can focus in on for that, whether it be Medicaid or the third party billing to keep the services going? Thank you.

03:07:25.480 --> 03:07:46.480
Yeah, and I'll ask Melissa to jump in on this as well because she's she's working on it day in and day out. But it's you know, you want to create an environment where the services are quote reimbursable in a way without turning the whole operation focused on billing.

03:07:46.480 --> 03:08:05.480
Right. And we have a real chance to do that. This whole rate schedule for the commercial plans, which will be mirrored and built on what we're doing in Medicaid will theoretically create an opportunity for bread and butter services that might happen in a school or might be linked to a school to be reimbursed.

03:08:05.480 --> 03:08:19.480
And even though I know that's focused on payment, but that is exactly what's going to allow us to keep these services going, not just for the five years of, you know, the Children with Behavioral Health Initiative, but way beyond that.

03:08:19.480 --> 03:08:37.480
And we are adding more services that you'll probably recognize as useful to what is reimbursed under Medicaid and soon under the commercial plans. Right. So there's family based services where it's not just about the student, but it's about what happens to the family.

03:08:37.480 --> 03:09:00.480
There's some population based services that might help cover, you know, a classroom or a school. There are some opportunities around virtual care and virtual services. So I think there's a real, again, collaboration that could bring together exactly what the school

03:09:00.480 --> 03:09:18.480
communities believe they can do and need to do and want to do to allow us to use the health lane and leverage it for those resources when possible. So this is a part of it that I'm really excited about. So I'm grateful that you amplify it.

03:09:18.480 --> 03:09:24.480
And I know Melissa spending time thinking through how we're going to actually get this right.

03:09:24.480 --> 03:09:28.480
Melissa, I don't know if you want to jump in on anything more on this.

03:09:28.480 --> 03:09:40.480
Nothing to add, but I'm happy to further time it's appropriate to dig in more to how the fiscal is going to work. It's really being developed as we speak. There's a new working group that's been established that just had its first meeting in October.

03:09:40.480 --> 03:09:51.480
So we're in that stage of really rolling up our sleeves to design and develop how this ongoing reimbursement mechanism is going to work over time.

03:09:51.480 --> 03:10:21.480
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

03:10:21.480 --> 03:10:51.480
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you

03:10:51.480 --> 03:10:57.480
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

03:10:57.480 --> 03:11:00.900
flag that we're seeing, particularly in the early side,

03:11:00.900 --> 03:11:04.400
that both in TK settings and early learning settings

03:11:04.400 --> 03:11:07.680
that school districts have a line of sight to

03:11:07.680 --> 03:11:12.440
that kids are coming in with less socialization

03:11:12.440 --> 03:11:15.920
with different sort of challenges and speech delays

03:11:15.920 --> 03:11:19.860
and how you're thinking about integrating that

03:11:19.860 --> 03:11:21.720
into this set of programming.

03:11:22.720 --> 03:11:27.720
Sure, and again, the sort of have four,

03:11:29.200 --> 03:11:31.120
three, four key buckets, right?

03:11:31.120 --> 03:11:36.120
It's sort of before kids get into the TK to 12 environment,

03:11:36.760 --> 03:11:39.080
that environment of TK to 12,

03:11:39.080 --> 03:11:41.800
which really breaks down to at least two or three,

03:11:41.800 --> 03:11:46.800
and then the post-secondary education side.

03:11:47.800 --> 03:11:52.920
I think the place where we probably,

03:11:52.920 --> 03:11:55.460
and Melissa, you may need to update this,

03:11:55.460 --> 03:11:59.640
have spent probably the least time to date

03:11:59.640 --> 03:12:04.640
is where are we on the earliest age groups

03:12:05.920 --> 03:12:08.960
where it's not necessarily all happening

03:12:08.960 --> 03:12:13.220
within a formal public school environment

03:12:13.220 --> 03:12:16.240
where it's a much more scattered network

03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:19.440
of providers of childcare services.

03:12:19.440 --> 03:12:23.700
So there we're leaning more heavy on things

03:12:23.700 --> 03:12:26.600
like our platform and some of these tools

03:12:26.600 --> 03:12:30.880
as the entry point to some of those services,

03:12:30.880 --> 03:12:34.880
but that's still very early in its creation.

03:12:34.880 --> 03:12:37.480
But Melissa, maybe you can talk a little bit more

03:12:37.480 --> 03:12:40.080
on what the engagement has looked like there.

03:12:40.080 --> 03:12:42.200
Sure, thanks so much.

03:12:42.200 --> 03:12:43.100
Yeah, I really appreciate that.

03:12:43.100 --> 03:12:44.760
I think we're still working through developing

03:12:45.120 --> 03:12:47.600
the overall approach to early childhood

03:12:47.600 --> 03:12:49.000
as Secretary Galli indicated,

03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:51.560
but there are a few key pieces that actually are underway.

03:12:51.560 --> 03:12:55.160
One is the addition of dyadic services

03:12:55.160 --> 03:12:57.640
as a benefit in the medical program,

03:12:57.640 --> 03:12:59.080
which was specifically meant,

03:12:59.080 --> 03:13:00.760
particularly for our youngest children,

03:13:00.760 --> 03:13:04.160
when behavioral and social-emotional issues are emerging

03:13:04.160 --> 03:13:07.240
to make sure that we have services in place

03:13:07.240 --> 03:13:09.320
that really allow not only the child,

03:13:09.320 --> 03:13:10.880
but the caregiver, the parent,

03:13:10.880 --> 03:13:13.200
to get some of the supports that they need.

03:13:13.240 --> 03:13:16.680
And that benefit will begin on January 21st, 2023.

03:13:16.680 --> 03:13:18.240
Actually, the Department of Healthcare Services

03:13:18.240 --> 03:13:20.880
just released yesterday, I think it was on their website,

03:13:20.880 --> 03:13:23.040
some additional information about the launch of that.

03:13:23.040 --> 03:13:25.840
So a really important piece that we know

03:13:25.840 --> 03:13:29.640
is coming to support not just the child, but the family.

03:13:29.640 --> 03:13:32.560
Secondly, the trauma-informed training for educators

03:13:32.560 --> 03:13:34.840
that Secretary Galli spoke of earlier

03:13:34.840 --> 03:13:38.600
has a specific component to it

03:13:38.600 --> 03:13:42.440
that is specifically for early care and learning providers.

03:13:42.440 --> 03:13:45.200
And this training will be free,

03:13:45.200 --> 03:13:46.840
it will be widely accessible

03:13:46.840 --> 03:13:49.280
when it becomes available next summer.

03:13:49.280 --> 03:13:53.040
And we know that given some of the challenges

03:13:53.040 --> 03:13:55.120
and the schedules for early care and learning providers,

03:13:55.120 --> 03:13:56.840
we're really hoping that that training

03:13:56.840 --> 03:14:00.000
will be available and accessible to them

03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:02.400
in beginning the work and the journey

03:14:02.400 --> 03:14:04.480
of really understanding trauma-informed care

03:14:04.480 --> 03:14:06.280
and how that can support them in their efforts

03:14:06.280 --> 03:14:07.560
of the incredible work they do

03:14:07.560 --> 03:14:10.000
in terms of caring for our youngest children.

03:14:10.400 --> 03:14:14.080
And Dr. Galli mentioned the platform as well.

03:14:14.080 --> 03:14:19.000
And then we are also the services in the fee schedule

03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:21.600
for our younger children who are on school campuses.

03:14:21.600 --> 03:14:23.880
We are looking at what those opportunities are there

03:14:23.880 --> 03:14:25.840
to the third building out to the fee schedule

03:14:25.840 --> 03:14:26.720
to think about that.

03:14:26.720 --> 03:14:29.960
And we've actually begun some very early conversations

03:14:29.960 --> 03:14:33.800
with our partners at CDE also about potential intersections

03:14:33.800 --> 03:14:37.920
between universal pre-kindergarten and the CYBH guide.

03:14:37.960 --> 03:14:41.800
Where might some of those key intersection points be?

03:14:41.800 --> 03:14:43.840
And then just the other piece I'll mention

03:14:43.840 --> 03:14:44.800
is two other pieces.

03:14:44.800 --> 03:14:47.120
One is the behavioral health coach role

03:14:47.120 --> 03:14:52.120
is actually envisioned to be a potential role

03:14:52.880 --> 03:14:54.640
in an early care and learning setting.

03:14:54.640 --> 03:14:56.880
We're not starting there first in terms of that,

03:14:56.880 --> 03:14:59.080
but that is really something we would be interested

03:14:59.080 --> 03:15:02.120
in working on over time with the early childhood sector

03:15:02.120 --> 03:15:05.000
to think about what would that deployment look like

03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:08.000
to have behavioral health coaches in those settings.

03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:10.320
And then lastly, just to note the work on stigma

03:15:10.320 --> 03:15:12.120
and public awareness,

03:15:12.120 --> 03:15:14.640
something we have heard from youth and from parents

03:15:14.640 --> 03:15:17.000
and a lot of engagement we've been doing with them

03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:20.600
is the work around public awareness and stigma

03:15:20.600 --> 03:15:23.320
as well as how to access supports and services

03:15:23.320 --> 03:15:24.600
that work around navigation

03:15:24.600 --> 03:15:26.520
that we think the platform is gonna be really helpful

03:15:26.520 --> 03:15:28.760
to doing we know is also really key

03:15:28.760 --> 03:15:30.360
for our families with very young.

03:15:31.360 --> 03:15:33.360
That's really awesome.

03:15:33.360 --> 03:15:35.640
With youngest children too,

03:15:35.640 --> 03:15:37.320
there's often a very close nexus

03:15:37.320 --> 03:15:39.800
between physical and biological health

03:15:39.800 --> 03:15:42.680
and mental health and behavioral health.

03:15:42.680 --> 03:15:45.200
And so I wonder if there's a component of this

03:15:45.200 --> 03:15:50.200
that connects to the other health providers

03:15:50.320 --> 03:15:53.200
and awareness of environmental hazards

03:15:53.200 --> 03:15:55.880
and so on that can often get expressed

03:15:56.720 --> 03:16:01.440
in behavioral dysregularities,

03:16:01.440 --> 03:16:04.440
but that are really stemming from other experiences

03:16:06.640 --> 03:16:10.680
the child is having physically or otherwise.

03:16:10.680 --> 03:16:13.440
We are, Linda, just to that point,

03:16:13.440 --> 03:16:16.080
one of the things we are exploring,

03:16:16.080 --> 03:16:19.520
we wouldn't be the first state to do this,

03:16:19.520 --> 03:16:22.600
but really what does a first thousand day of life

03:16:22.600 --> 03:16:25.600
initiative look like that focuses on

03:16:26.240 --> 03:16:28.520
how all of this is really tied together.

03:16:28.520 --> 03:16:31.800
And that's another place where as we talked about it,

03:16:31.800 --> 03:16:34.800
could certainly could use your expertise

03:16:34.800 --> 03:16:38.640
and advice of the board on what that looks like.

03:16:38.640 --> 03:16:42.240
So I think about things like,

03:16:42.240 --> 03:16:45.280
autism is now one in 44 kids, right?

03:16:45.280 --> 03:16:48.360
And there are a lot of behavioral manifestations

03:16:48.360 --> 03:16:49.760
that people might pick up on,

03:16:49.760 --> 03:16:51.400
but then there's a whole biological

03:16:51.400 --> 03:16:53.320
and environmental component and so on.

03:16:53.320 --> 03:16:55.760
So there's gonna, that integrated approach

03:16:55.760 --> 03:17:00.560
that you're championing is just incredibly important

03:17:00.560 --> 03:17:01.760
in so many ways.

03:17:02.840 --> 03:17:07.640
Member Rodriguez, I think you get the last word.

03:17:07.640 --> 03:17:11.000
Yes, thank you so much, President Darlene Hammond.

03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:13.400
And a lot of what I was going to say has been said

03:17:13.400 --> 03:17:15.760
and I won't be redundant and repeat it,

03:17:15.760 --> 03:17:19.360
just wanna echo my appreciation for my colleagues

03:17:19.360 --> 03:17:22.800
and especially member Petillo-Gruntz

03:17:22.880 --> 03:17:26.560
because I was going to say, Dr. Galli,

03:17:26.560 --> 03:17:27.400
thank you so much.

03:17:27.400 --> 03:17:30.600
Your voice was a very calming voice during the pandemic.

03:17:30.600 --> 03:17:33.280
And as you were here, I was taken back

03:17:33.280 --> 03:17:35.240
to how much I looked forward to your updates.

03:17:35.240 --> 03:17:36.880
So I appreciate that.

03:17:36.880 --> 03:17:40.720
And also Melissa just talked about the stigma

03:17:40.720 --> 03:17:43.040
and that's what I wanted to share a little bit about.

03:17:43.040 --> 03:17:47.400
In my community, which is largely Mexican, right?

03:17:47.400 --> 03:17:49.880
We live next to the Mexican border.

03:17:49.920 --> 03:17:53.440
There is a stigma with mental health,

03:17:53.440 --> 03:17:54.920
like, oh, it's all in your head.

03:17:54.920 --> 03:17:57.160
And the stigma exists in other cultures,

03:17:57.160 --> 03:18:01.120
but just suck it up and deal with it.

03:18:01.120 --> 03:18:03.480
And so that's something

03:18:03.480 --> 03:18:07.040
that our community has been working hard

03:18:07.040 --> 03:18:09.920
and especially the support,

03:18:09.920 --> 03:18:12.120
the behavioral health at our school.

03:18:13.240 --> 03:18:15.800
We don't quite have the EPA model

03:18:15.800 --> 03:18:20.800
of having psychologists working on our campus,

03:18:22.400 --> 03:18:23.360
but right next to us,

03:18:23.360 --> 03:18:26.120
we do have a behavioral health specialist

03:18:26.120 --> 03:18:27.440
and a great relationship.

03:18:27.440 --> 03:18:31.200
And I've seen how much my students appreciate

03:18:32.280 --> 03:18:35.600
having a therapist, licensed therapist to talk to

03:18:35.600 --> 03:18:38.680
when we have our school assemblies and they introduce her,

03:18:38.680 --> 03:18:40.640
she gets the most applause.

03:18:40.640 --> 03:18:44.640
And so we're making some great strides

03:18:44.640 --> 03:18:47.440
and it wouldn't be possible without the commitment

03:18:47.440 --> 03:18:50.240
from our governor, from your department,

03:18:50.240 --> 03:18:55.240
from the CDE, Superintendent Thurman.

03:18:55.800 --> 03:18:57.640
And this is what it takes

03:18:57.640 --> 03:19:01.360
because I see a lot of desperation

03:19:01.360 --> 03:19:03.440
and this is the hope, right?

03:19:03.440 --> 03:19:06.480
When people are desperate,

03:19:06.480 --> 03:19:08.520
especially a lot of our foster youth

03:19:08.520 --> 03:19:10.800
is when they feel like they have nothing to lose

03:19:11.040 --> 03:19:15.680
and these services bring in that light of hope.

03:19:15.680 --> 03:19:17.280
So thank you so much.

03:19:19.160 --> 03:19:24.160
Well, if I could just wrap by saying,

03:19:25.400 --> 03:19:30.400
the last two members brought up the pandemic

03:19:30.440 --> 03:19:31.960
and I will tell you, Linda,

03:19:31.960 --> 03:19:34.200
we haven't had the privilege of connecting

03:19:34.200 --> 03:19:35.920
since it's been calmer.

03:19:36.320 --> 03:19:37.520
No.

03:19:37.520 --> 03:19:42.520
But as we reflect back at some of the important efforts

03:19:44.240 --> 03:19:49.240
in California, as it relates to pandemic response,

03:19:49.280 --> 03:19:50.960
the more time I spend doing it,

03:19:50.960 --> 03:19:55.640
the more I realize we were playing catch up

03:19:55.640 --> 03:19:57.720
from the very beginning.

03:19:57.720 --> 03:20:01.240
We have not invested enough in the community

03:20:02.240 --> 03:20:06.160
infrastructure that we need to really carry forward

03:20:06.160 --> 03:20:10.720
and be prepared for the next public health emergency.

03:20:10.720 --> 03:20:14.760
And as much as the Children Youth Behavioral Health

03:20:14.760 --> 03:20:18.000
Initiative, our partnerships with you as educators

03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:21.200
of schools becomes about really anchoring

03:20:21.200 --> 03:20:25.080
and building resilient, thriving communities

03:20:25.080 --> 03:20:27.800
for young people and their families.

03:20:27.800 --> 03:20:30.680
I think we are better set up to deal with

03:20:30.720 --> 03:20:33.040
whatever comes across our plate,

03:20:33.040 --> 03:20:38.040
whether it's the next variance or the really the huge number

03:20:39.360 --> 03:20:43.560
or increase in behavioral health needs across our state.

03:20:43.560 --> 03:20:48.560
So if anything that we do builds that community sense,

03:20:51.200 --> 03:20:54.560
I think we're really doing more from this whole child

03:20:54.560 --> 03:20:57.560
approach for kids and their families.

03:20:57.560 --> 03:21:01.040
So this partnership is not just something

03:21:01.040 --> 03:21:04.680
that we hope to talk about for an hour today,

03:21:04.680 --> 03:21:08.320
but something that we invite all of your input on

03:21:08.320 --> 03:21:10.400
and critique us, tell us, hey, it doesn't seem like

03:21:10.400 --> 03:21:12.560
you're holding up your end of the bargain.

03:21:12.560 --> 03:21:13.440
Can you do more?

03:21:13.440 --> 03:21:15.960
Can't you think a little bit more flexibly?

03:21:15.960 --> 03:21:18.120
And we'll do the same to you.

03:21:18.120 --> 03:21:21.440
We each have our rigid ways of thinking about things.

03:21:21.440 --> 03:21:25.000
And frankly, that rigidity is what probably gets

03:21:25.000 --> 03:21:27.400
in the way of our collaboration the most.

03:21:28.240 --> 03:21:32.360
So I don't mean to take the final word in any way,

03:21:32.360 --> 03:21:35.240
but more an invitation to continue this conversation

03:21:35.240 --> 03:21:36.960
in meaningful ways down the road.

03:21:37.840 --> 03:21:39.720
Well, we appreciate it so much.

03:21:39.720 --> 03:21:43.160
It's a hugely important initiative.

03:21:43.160 --> 03:21:45.320
And Mark, I know we've been talking about this

03:21:45.320 --> 03:21:48.840
for many months, how to bring the systems together.

03:21:48.840 --> 03:21:52.520
I think it's wonderful to see the step being taken.

03:21:52.520 --> 03:21:55.680
And we really appreciate you and Melissa joining us.

03:21:55.800 --> 03:21:59.080
We'll have a chance after lunch to re-engage

03:21:59.080 --> 03:22:01.720
with our community schools team and talk more

03:22:01.720 --> 03:22:04.640
about the connections that can be made there.

03:22:04.640 --> 03:22:05.880
Thanks so much.

03:22:05.880 --> 03:22:06.720
Take care.

03:22:06.720 --> 03:22:08.320
Thank you all, be well.

03:22:08.320 --> 03:22:12.440
And I will announce that the rest of us can go to lunch.

03:22:12.440 --> 03:22:16.640
It is about 12.16, so we'll come back at about 12.45.

03:22:17.640 --> 03:22:18.760
We'll see you then.

03:22:18.760 --> 03:22:21.840
Leave your, don't leave the meeting,

03:22:21.840 --> 03:22:24.840
just turn off your camera and your microphone.

03:22:25.680 --> 03:22:26.520
Thank you.

03:22:33.080 --> 03:22:34.840
Welcome back.

03:22:34.840 --> 03:22:37.080
Board members, we need to reestablish a quorum,

03:22:37.080 --> 03:22:39.080
so Brooks is going to call the roll.

03:22:40.000 --> 03:22:41.720
President Darlin Hammond.

03:22:41.720 --> 03:22:42.840
Here.

03:22:42.840 --> 03:22:44.680
Member Escobedo.

03:22:44.680 --> 03:22:45.520
Here.

03:22:45.520 --> 03:22:47.720
Vice President Glover-Woods.

03:22:47.720 --> 03:22:48.640
Here.

03:22:48.640 --> 03:22:50.320
Member Lewis.

03:22:50.320 --> 03:22:51.360
Here.

03:22:51.360 --> 03:22:52.320
Member McQuillin.

03:22:53.320 --> 03:22:54.400
Here.

03:22:54.400 --> 03:22:55.240
Member Olken.

03:22:56.360 --> 03:22:57.320
Here.

03:22:57.320 --> 03:22:59.440
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

03:22:59.440 --> 03:23:00.760
Here.

03:23:00.760 --> 03:23:02.000
Member Petillo-Bronson.

03:23:02.920 --> 03:23:04.000
Here.

03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:04.840
Member Porter.

03:23:05.880 --> 03:23:06.720
Here.

03:23:06.720 --> 03:23:07.560
Member Rodriguez.

Here.

03:23:10.160 --> 03:23:11.480

03:23:12.720 --> 03:23:13.560
Here.

03:23:13.560 --> 03:23:14.560
Everyone is present.

03:23:15.720 --> 03:23:17.760
Terrific, we are now going to continue

03:23:17.760 --> 03:23:20.680
with the community schools item with a presentation

03:23:20.680 --> 03:23:21.720
by the community schools

03:23:21.760 --> 03:23:24.840
State Transformational Assistance Center.

03:23:24.840 --> 03:23:27.240
We're going to hear from Dr. Navdeep Pirwal

03:23:27.240 --> 03:23:30.000
of Alameda County Office of Education,

03:23:30.000 --> 03:23:33.640
and Dr. Karen Hunter-Quartz of the UCLA Center

03:23:33.640 --> 03:23:35.080
for Community Schooling.

03:23:35.960 --> 03:23:38.280
Dr. Pirwal, please proceed.

03:23:40.880 --> 03:23:43.560
Good afternoon, President Darlin Hammond

03:23:43.560 --> 03:23:44.840
and board members.

03:23:44.840 --> 03:23:47.680
On behalf of our State Transformational Assistance Center,

03:23:47.680 --> 03:23:50.680
or STAC, I want to thank both the state board

03:23:50.720 --> 03:23:53.080
and Department of Education for the opportunity

03:23:53.080 --> 03:23:55.880
to lead the statewide Transformational Assistance

03:23:55.880 --> 03:23:59.120
for the California Community Schools Partnership Program.

03:23:59.120 --> 03:24:02.600
During today's presentation, I will be sharing

03:24:02.600 --> 03:24:04.680
our STAC journey and an update

03:24:04.680 --> 03:24:06.520
on the Transformational Assistance

03:24:06.520 --> 03:24:08.360
we have provided to date.

03:24:08.360 --> 03:24:10.960
Then I'll be passing it off to my esteemed colleague,

03:24:10.960 --> 03:24:12.240
Karen Hunter-Quartz,

03:24:12.240 --> 03:24:15.120
Director at the UCLA Center of Community Schooling,

03:24:15.120 --> 03:24:17.240
who will be sharing our Transformational Assistance

03:24:17.240 --> 03:24:20.040
methodology and vision moving forward.

03:24:21.360 --> 03:24:23.360
Our STAC journey begins with the team members

03:24:23.360 --> 03:24:26.440
from our four partner organizations pictured here.

03:24:26.440 --> 03:24:29.200
Aligned with the California Community Schools framework,

03:24:29.200 --> 03:24:31.280
our STAC has been intentional

03:24:31.280 --> 03:24:34.200
in fostering strong relationships among our team

03:24:34.200 --> 03:24:37.400
through weekly meetings and in-person retreats.

03:24:37.400 --> 03:24:40.240
During our time together, we have shared what brings us

03:24:40.240 --> 03:24:43.160
to the social justice, equity enhancing work,

03:24:43.160 --> 03:24:45.240
as well as identifying our assets

03:24:45.240 --> 03:24:47.400
and opportunities for growth.

03:24:47.400 --> 03:24:49.240
We have taken the time necessary

03:24:49.240 --> 03:24:52.640
to engage in these processes in order to effectively lead

03:24:52.640 --> 03:24:56.040
the transformation and redesign of schools in California

03:24:56.040 --> 03:24:58.920
to be racially just, relationship centered,

03:24:58.920 --> 03:25:01.840
and responsive to the needs of the whole child.

03:25:04.440 --> 03:25:06.360
Early on during an opening activity

03:25:06.360 --> 03:25:08.000
in one of our weekly meetings,

03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:10.120
our team engaged in a discussion around

03:25:10.120 --> 03:25:11.760
how the implementation

03:25:11.760 --> 03:25:14.560
of the California Community Schools Partnership Program

03:25:14.560 --> 03:25:17.480
promotes a process of social transformation

03:25:17.480 --> 03:25:19.680
capable of disrupting inequities

03:25:19.680 --> 03:25:23.360
rather than a siloed, top down approach to programming.

03:25:23.360 --> 03:25:25.920
As a result, we made the shared decision

03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:29.200
to change the term technical to transformational

03:25:29.200 --> 03:25:32.400
and strive to help students, families, educators,

03:25:32.400 --> 03:25:35.760
and community members acknowledge this opportunity

03:25:35.760 --> 03:25:38.880
for authentic partnerships and reciprocal learning.

03:25:41.400 --> 03:25:43.880
We believe that this program provides an opportunity

03:25:43.880 --> 03:25:47.000
for coherence through the intentional alignment

03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:50.640
of several whole child reform investments listed here.

03:25:50.640 --> 03:25:53.000
Although this list is not exhaustive,

03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:55.720
I wanted to acknowledge that the investments align

03:25:55.720 --> 03:25:56.920
under the four pillars

03:25:56.920 --> 03:25:59.080
of the California Community Schools framework

03:25:59.080 --> 03:26:01.240
and that there's also alignment

03:26:01.240 --> 03:26:03.520
within and among the pillars.

03:26:03.520 --> 03:26:06.040
For example, the universal pre-kindergarten

03:26:06.040 --> 03:26:09.080
and expanded learning opportunities program investments,

03:26:09.080 --> 03:26:11.520
which align with the expanded learning time

03:26:11.520 --> 03:26:14.760
and opportunities pillar, require plans

03:26:14.760 --> 03:26:17.520
that include details on how the programs will work

03:26:17.520 --> 03:26:19.720
in concert with each other,

03:26:19.720 --> 03:26:22.040
encouraging the alignment of resources,

03:26:22.040 --> 03:26:25.280
professional learning, and partnerships.

03:26:25.280 --> 03:26:27.680
Another example is how the children

03:26:27.680 --> 03:26:29.920
and youth behavior health initiative

03:26:29.920 --> 03:26:33.320
that we heard about earlier today by Dr. Galli,

03:26:33.320 --> 03:26:36.400
which aligns with the integrated student supports pillar,

03:26:36.400 --> 03:26:37.840
shares key components

03:26:37.840 --> 03:26:40.680
with a family and community engagement pillar

03:26:40.680 --> 03:26:44.320
through the engagement of youth, families, and community

03:26:44.360 --> 03:26:47.720
in the development and ongoing work of the program.

03:26:48.840 --> 03:26:52.240
Our S-TAC is grounded in the belief

03:26:52.240 --> 03:26:54.680
that working together collaboratively

03:26:54.680 --> 03:26:56.600
with decision makers, implementers,

03:26:56.600 --> 03:26:58.680
and recipients of these programs,

03:26:58.680 --> 03:27:00.880
we can maximize the resources

03:27:00.880 --> 03:27:03.280
and co-create sustainability plans

03:27:03.280 --> 03:27:06.480
to support the diverse needs of children for years to come.

03:27:09.040 --> 03:27:10.880
With the belief in the continuous learning

03:27:10.880 --> 03:27:12.720
and improvement to redesign schools

03:27:12.720 --> 03:27:14.880
to be places of transformation,

03:27:14.880 --> 03:27:17.800
rooted in racially just, relationship centered,

03:27:17.800 --> 03:27:21.560
and inclusive practices that demonstrate coherence,

03:27:21.560 --> 03:27:24.160
this timeline illustrates our S-TAC's journey.

03:27:25.240 --> 03:27:26.960
A few highlights include hosting

03:27:26.960 --> 03:27:30.120
our first quarterly advisory board meeting in July,

03:27:30.120 --> 03:27:32.200
which includes members from state

03:27:32.200 --> 03:27:34.560
and nationally recognized organizations,

03:27:34.560 --> 03:27:37.040
as well as launching our first webinar.

03:27:37.040 --> 03:27:39.000
In August, we set into motion

03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:40.960
our weekly collective learning space

03:27:40.960 --> 03:27:43.760
and monthly community of transformative practice,

03:27:43.760 --> 03:27:45.720
while establishing bi-weekly update

03:27:45.720 --> 03:27:48.200
and calibration meetings with the CDE team.

03:27:49.120 --> 03:27:52.960
In September, we engaged in our first monthly meeting

03:27:52.960 --> 03:27:53.760
with the team members

03:27:53.760 --> 03:27:56.240
from the California County Superintendents,

03:27:56.240 --> 03:27:59.320
recognizing the key role of county offices

03:27:59.320 --> 03:28:02.080
in supporting alignment and coherence

03:28:02.080 --> 03:28:04.080
among local education agencies.

03:28:05.200 --> 03:28:09.160
In October, our S-TAC team developed working subcommittees

03:28:09.160 --> 03:28:13.400
focused on resources, communications, webinars,

03:28:13.400 --> 03:28:16.120
communities of transformative practice, and data.

03:28:17.720 --> 03:28:20.120
As we have been developing our own infrastructure

03:28:20.120 --> 03:28:23.360
to ensure that our assistance is truly transformational,

03:28:23.360 --> 03:28:26.080
we have been mindful of the importance

03:28:26.080 --> 03:28:28.920
in being responsive to the needs of our partners.

03:28:28.920 --> 03:28:31.840
So we have designed and facilitated an initial round

03:28:31.840 --> 03:28:34.880
of transformational assistance highlighted,

03:28:34.880 --> 03:28:36.920
and now I'll be sharing more about those.

03:28:37.920 --> 03:28:41.960
Our webinars are a space where we encourage and welcome

03:28:41.960 --> 03:28:44.280
planning and implementation grantees,

03:28:44.280 --> 03:28:46.480
as well as families, students,

03:28:46.480 --> 03:28:49.240
community partners, and school leaders.

03:28:49.240 --> 03:28:51.440
Participants are provided opportunities to learn

03:28:51.440 --> 03:28:53.640
about the California community school framework,

03:28:53.640 --> 03:28:56.320
hear successes and challenges through stories shared

03:28:56.320 --> 03:28:58.160
by community school implementers,

03:28:58.160 --> 03:29:00.200
and take away tools and resources

03:29:00.200 --> 03:29:02.360
for supporting planning and implementation.

03:29:03.200 --> 03:29:05.680
The monthly community of transformative practice

03:29:05.680 --> 03:29:08.840
is designed for members from county offices of education

03:29:08.840 --> 03:29:12.760
to strategize ways to support grantees within their counties,

03:29:12.760 --> 03:29:16.360
share expertise, and network with statewide colleagues

03:29:16.360 --> 03:29:18.720
charged with the implementation of programs

03:29:18.720 --> 03:29:20.280
that support the whole child.

03:29:22.400 --> 03:29:25.440
And finally, the weekly collective learning space

03:29:25.440 --> 03:29:28.240
is designed for planning and implementation grantees

03:29:28.240 --> 03:29:30.480
who have questions or a desire to network

03:29:30.520 --> 03:29:34.360
with colleagues on a regular basis.

03:29:34.360 --> 03:29:37.600
The webinars, communities of transformative practice,

03:29:37.600 --> 03:29:39.560
and collective learning spaces

03:29:39.560 --> 03:29:42.000
have supported the development of relationships

03:29:42.000 --> 03:29:45.440
and provided our STAC team the opportunity

03:29:45.440 --> 03:29:48.360
to learn about planning and implementation needs,

03:29:48.360 --> 03:29:50.800
which we continue to respond to

03:29:50.800 --> 03:29:53.680
through our transformational assistance.

03:29:53.680 --> 03:29:56.040
And now, Karen will share our strategic vision

03:29:56.040 --> 03:29:57.080
moving forward.

03:29:58.080 --> 03:29:59.880
Thank you, Nav, and good afternoon,

03:29:59.880 --> 03:30:02.480
President Darling-Hammond and board members.

03:30:02.480 --> 03:30:05.000
As Dr. Pirwell has shared, our STAC team

03:30:05.000 --> 03:30:07.800
has been developing an initial set of learning opportunities

03:30:07.800 --> 03:30:09.760
for grantees and counties.

03:30:09.760 --> 03:30:12.440
Alongside this work, we've been meeting as a team

03:30:12.440 --> 03:30:14.280
to flesh out this logic model

03:30:14.280 --> 03:30:16.720
to capture the methodology of RTA,

03:30:16.720 --> 03:30:20.480
the strategies and expected outcomes that guide our center.

03:30:20.480 --> 03:30:22.480
So traditional logic models often start

03:30:22.480 --> 03:30:24.320
with a problem or gap statement,

03:30:25.200 --> 03:30:28.480
but our advisory board recommended that we reframe this

03:30:28.480 --> 03:30:31.240
to focus on the opportunity we have right now

03:30:31.240 --> 03:30:34.480
to redesign schools as relationship-centered,

03:30:34.480 --> 03:30:38.360
democratic, and just spaces where students, educators,

03:30:38.360 --> 03:30:40.800
families, and communities can thrive.

03:30:40.800 --> 03:30:43.240
The California Community Schools Partnership Program

03:30:43.240 --> 03:30:44.760
is the evidence-based program

03:30:44.760 --> 03:30:47.160
designed to embrace this opportunity.

03:30:47.160 --> 03:30:49.480
The framework starts with the four pillars

03:30:49.480 --> 03:30:53.840
described in the field setting 2017 review of research

03:30:53.840 --> 03:30:54.880
on community schools,

03:30:54.880 --> 03:30:57.320
but it goes far beyond the four pillars.

03:30:57.320 --> 03:30:59.320
It's a vision based on the science of learning

03:30:59.320 --> 03:31:03.040
and development, the conditions young people need to thrive

03:31:03.040 --> 03:31:05.320
and the work of classroom teachers.

03:31:05.320 --> 03:31:07.160
It also lifts up the core commitments

03:31:07.160 --> 03:31:09.880
that animate the movement, building on assets,

03:31:09.880 --> 03:31:13.640
advancing racial justice, culturally proficient instruction

03:31:13.640 --> 03:31:15.720
and authentic shared leadership.

03:31:15.720 --> 03:31:18.360
And finally, the framework highlights the proven practices

03:31:18.360 --> 03:31:22.440
that community schools use to propel social transformation.

03:31:22.440 --> 03:31:25.080
So this is very much a transformational framework,

03:31:25.080 --> 03:31:28.480
and we've tried to design a set of TA strategies

03:31:28.480 --> 03:31:31.080
to integrate the allied reform movements

03:31:31.080 --> 03:31:34.280
that Nav referenced and that we heard about this morning

03:31:34.280 --> 03:31:36.200
and support statewide understanding

03:31:36.200 --> 03:31:38.000
and commitment to the framework.

03:31:38.000 --> 03:31:39.760
These strategies include communities

03:31:39.760 --> 03:31:42.120
of transformative practice, webinars,

03:31:42.120 --> 03:31:45.480
a collective learning space, study tours,

03:31:45.480 --> 03:31:47.680
digital commons and resources,

03:31:47.680 --> 03:31:51.440
and a deep dive strategy that I'll explain in more depth.

03:31:51.480 --> 03:31:54.560
Key to our methodology is a focus on data, stories

03:31:54.560 --> 03:31:57.800
and community-based measures to help grantees learn

03:31:57.800 --> 03:31:59.880
and improve along this journey.

03:31:59.880 --> 03:32:01.600
And as you can see in the last two columns

03:32:01.600 --> 03:32:03.040
of this logic model,

03:32:03.040 --> 03:32:04.840
we expect the California Community Schools

03:32:04.840 --> 03:32:07.360
Partnership Program implementation

03:32:07.360 --> 03:32:10.280
to lead to community agency and wellbeing,

03:32:10.280 --> 03:32:14.080
redesign schools and improved outcomes on multiple measures.

03:32:15.320 --> 03:32:17.120
So next slide, please.

03:32:17.120 --> 03:32:19.480
To support this very ambitious vision,

03:32:19.480 --> 03:32:21.160
we know schools, districts and counties

03:32:21.840 --> 03:32:23.440
need tools to guide implementation

03:32:23.440 --> 03:32:24.960
and track their progress.

03:32:24.960 --> 03:32:26.720
So this slide maps out our process

03:32:26.720 --> 03:32:29.200
to operationalize the state's framework

03:32:29.200 --> 03:32:32.600
in what we're calling an implementation growth chart.

03:32:32.600 --> 03:32:35.240
Our STAC team made the shared decision

03:32:35.240 --> 03:32:38.680
to use this language instead of implementation rubric

03:32:38.680 --> 03:32:41.720
to emphasize continuous learning and development.

03:32:41.720 --> 03:32:44.080
We have been reviewing and synthesizing

03:32:44.080 --> 03:32:46.600
implementation science resources,

03:32:46.600 --> 03:32:48.760
as well as frameworks and rubrics developed

03:32:48.760 --> 03:32:53.040
by local, state and national organizations.

03:32:53.040 --> 03:32:55.440
Later this month, we will be sharing a first draft

03:32:55.440 --> 03:32:58.640
of a set of foundational concepts and benchmarks

03:32:58.640 --> 03:33:00.680
to guide implementation.

03:33:00.680 --> 03:33:03.240
And we know how important it is to get these concepts

03:33:03.240 --> 03:33:06.160
and benchmarks right, so over the next few months,

03:33:06.160 --> 03:33:08.520
we will organize multiple opportunities

03:33:08.520 --> 03:33:09.800
for feedback and revision.

03:33:11.360 --> 03:33:14.600
One of our TA strategies, next slide, please,

03:33:14.600 --> 03:33:17.000
is to take a series of deep dives

03:33:17.000 --> 03:33:20.080
into local implementation contexts

03:33:20.080 --> 03:33:23.120
to support learning and document the infrastructure

03:33:23.120 --> 03:33:26.600
it takes to develop and sustain community schools.

03:33:26.600 --> 03:33:29.840
Research on the science of implementation

03:33:29.840 --> 03:33:33.440
cautions us, right, against lifting up sites of innovation

03:33:33.440 --> 03:33:36.640
without paying attention to the systems and structures

03:33:36.640 --> 03:33:39.120
that will sustain change and ensure coherence

03:33:39.120 --> 03:33:41.840
at every level, from the school, to the district,

03:33:41.840 --> 03:33:44.160
to the county, to the region.

03:33:44.160 --> 03:33:46.000
For this reason, we are planning to partner

03:33:46.000 --> 03:33:48.880
with three deep dive implementation teams

03:33:48.880 --> 03:33:50.680
each year of the program.

03:33:50.680 --> 03:33:53.880
In six years, we expect to have 18 diverse

03:33:53.880 --> 03:33:57.720
implementation contexts to help us chart the path forward

03:33:57.720 --> 03:34:01.120
and sustain community schools throughout the state.

03:34:01.120 --> 03:34:04.120
We will work with these teams to document challenges,

03:34:04.120 --> 03:34:06.560
systems, process and outcome data,

03:34:06.560 --> 03:34:08.800
including local stories of transformation

03:34:08.800 --> 03:34:10.480
and school redesign.

03:34:10.480 --> 03:34:13.160
Data from these deep dives will be used to identify

03:34:13.160 --> 03:34:15.320
what needs to be learned next.

03:34:15.320 --> 03:34:17.240
So think of this as a large scale plan

03:34:17.240 --> 03:34:19.920
for continuous statewide learning.

03:34:19.920 --> 03:34:22.240
To identify the first three sites in January,

03:34:22.240 --> 03:34:24.880
our team is currently analyzing and coding

03:34:24.880 --> 03:34:27.640
the cohort one implementation proposals,

03:34:27.640 --> 03:34:30.920
and we will be conducting follow-up data collection.

03:34:30.920 --> 03:34:32.320
So staying on the top of data,

03:34:32.320 --> 03:34:35.680
our STAC team is developing a multiple measures framework

03:34:35.680 --> 03:34:39.120
to capture the many dimensions of social transformation.

03:34:39.120 --> 03:34:40.760
This will include data generated

03:34:40.760 --> 03:34:42.760
by the implementation growth chart

03:34:42.760 --> 03:34:45.000
to help grantees learn and improve.

03:34:45.680 --> 03:34:48.600
It'll also include support for community-based measures

03:34:48.600 --> 03:34:51.920
that lift up outcomes local communities value

03:34:51.920 --> 03:34:54.200
and use to track their growth.

03:34:54.200 --> 03:34:56.400
For example, at the UCLA Community School,

03:34:56.400 --> 03:34:59.440
they have collected biliteracy data for the last 12 years

03:34:59.440 --> 03:35:01.200
to inform the development of their K-12

03:35:01.200 --> 03:35:02.800
dual language program.

03:35:02.800 --> 03:35:04.000
And at the district level,

03:35:04.000 --> 03:35:06.880
the LA Unified has a graduate portfolio

03:35:06.880 --> 03:35:10.200
to capture students' growth and development over time.

03:35:10.200 --> 03:35:12.080
We're also very mindful that we are accountable

03:35:12.080 --> 03:35:14.920
to the public for ensuring this historic investment

03:35:15.840 --> 03:35:17.800
in public education is transformative.

03:35:17.800 --> 03:35:20.360
To build coherence across programs and agencies

03:35:20.360 --> 03:35:22.280
that support community schools,

03:35:22.280 --> 03:35:24.320
such as health and social welfare,

03:35:24.320 --> 03:35:26.200
we will be convening a cross-sector

03:35:26.200 --> 03:35:28.160
multiple measures working group

03:35:28.160 --> 03:35:30.320
to integrate accountability systems

03:35:30.320 --> 03:35:33.600
from a whole child, whole community perspective.

03:35:33.600 --> 03:35:36.040
We also look forward to the opportunity to support

03:35:36.040 --> 03:35:37.440
the statewide evaluation

03:35:37.440 --> 03:35:40.960
of the California Community Schools Partnership Program.

03:35:40.960 --> 03:35:42.400
Next slide, please.

03:35:42.400 --> 03:35:44.240
So we're excited by today's announcement

03:35:44.240 --> 03:35:45.680
of the eight proposed

03:35:45.680 --> 03:35:47.880
Regional Technical Assistance Centers.

03:35:47.880 --> 03:35:50.360
Many of the people and partners in these RTACs

03:35:50.360 --> 03:35:52.320
have connections and experience

03:35:52.320 --> 03:35:54.400
working with members of our team.

03:35:54.400 --> 03:35:56.680
We know they bring enormous expertise

03:35:56.680 --> 03:35:59.880
and insider knowledge of their own regional contexts,

03:35:59.880 --> 03:36:02.480
their local control accountability plans,

03:36:02.480 --> 03:36:06.600
fiscal oversight system charter schools and county schools.

03:36:06.600 --> 03:36:08.160
Next slide, please.

03:36:08.160 --> 03:36:10.120
So as this timeline maps out,

03:36:10.120 --> 03:36:13.280
we're going to be reaching out to each RTAC team

03:36:13.320 --> 03:36:15.960
right away to further develop our relationships

03:36:15.960 --> 03:36:17.680
and start planning together,

03:36:17.680 --> 03:36:21.680
including a 2023 Statewide Summer Institute.

03:36:21.680 --> 03:36:24.160
We're also preparing to release a set of resources,

03:36:24.160 --> 03:36:26.120
including the implementation growth chart

03:36:26.120 --> 03:36:27.920
and a set of guides and tools

03:36:27.920 --> 03:36:30.240
to be housed on a digital commons

03:36:30.240 --> 03:36:33.160
and widely shared in different learning spaces.

03:36:33.160 --> 03:36:35.760
In January, we'll launch our deep dive strategy

03:36:35.760 --> 03:36:40.200
to learn with and from three local implementation teams,

03:36:40.200 --> 03:36:41.880
which we're calling our first cohort

03:36:41.920 --> 03:36:43.960
community school fellows.

03:36:43.960 --> 03:36:44.800
And in the new year,

03:36:44.800 --> 03:36:46.640
we'll also convene our cross sector

03:36:46.640 --> 03:36:48.480
multiple measures working group

03:36:48.480 --> 03:36:51.760
to begin to integrate process and outcome measures.

03:36:51.760 --> 03:36:53.680
So I hope this presentation has given you

03:36:53.680 --> 03:36:56.840
a helpful overview of our S-TAC journey to date.

03:36:56.840 --> 03:36:58.680
I'd like to end by sharing a little bit

03:36:58.680 --> 03:37:01.080
about why we're doing this work.

03:37:01.080 --> 03:37:02.720
So each Wednesday morning,

03:37:02.720 --> 03:37:04.880
we start our S-TAC team meetings

03:37:04.880 --> 03:37:07.160
with a jam board visioning activity

03:37:07.160 --> 03:37:11.240
to help us reimagine California's public education system

03:37:11.240 --> 03:37:14.240
rooted in our own team's strengths and experiences

03:37:14.240 --> 03:37:17.280
combating structural racism and poverty.

03:37:17.280 --> 03:37:18.800
As a multiracial community,

03:37:18.800 --> 03:37:22.160
we have shared our hearts and our lived experiences

03:37:22.160 --> 03:37:26.120
as educators, social workers, engineers, immigrants,

03:37:26.120 --> 03:37:30.120
students, researchers, principals, farm workers,

03:37:30.120 --> 03:37:32.640
parents and community organizers.

03:37:32.640 --> 03:37:34.920
We lift up ideas and examples

03:37:34.920 --> 03:37:37.200
from across the state and nation,

03:37:37.200 --> 03:37:39.920
knowing there is enormous collective wisdom

03:37:39.920 --> 03:37:41.560
to guide this journey.

03:37:41.560 --> 03:37:44.600
This photo is from the UCLA community school where I work

03:37:44.600 --> 03:37:46.920
and I'm continually inspired by educators

03:37:46.920 --> 03:37:50.040
who lift up student voice and agency.

03:37:50.040 --> 03:37:51.520
Last week, I had an opportunity

03:37:51.520 --> 03:37:53.680
to visit another school garden,

03:37:53.680 --> 03:37:56.320
the Magnolia Agriscience Community Center

03:37:56.320 --> 03:37:58.240
in Anaheim, California.

03:37:58.240 --> 03:38:00.680
And I am delighted that their team is here today

03:38:00.680 --> 03:38:03.280
to further inspire learning about the promise

03:38:03.280 --> 03:38:04.640
of community schooling.

03:38:04.640 --> 03:38:05.480
Thank you.

03:38:10.760 --> 03:38:12.320
Thank you so much.

03:38:12.320 --> 03:38:16.320
Is that the conclusion of your presentation, Dr. Quartz?

03:38:16.320 --> 03:38:17.160
Yes, it is.

03:38:17.160 --> 03:38:20.600
Okay, so I want to move us along then

03:38:20.600 --> 03:38:23.960
to the Anaheim Union High School District.

03:38:23.960 --> 03:38:27.200
Superintendent Matsuda and his team are here.

03:38:27.200 --> 03:38:29.160
So please begin.

03:38:30.600 --> 03:38:34.600
Thank you so much, Chair of the Garden of Manhattan.

03:38:34.600 --> 03:38:36.640
The State Board of Education

03:38:36.640 --> 03:38:38.520
is really an honor to be part of this.

03:38:38.560 --> 03:38:39.760
The State Board of Education is really an honor

03:38:39.760 --> 03:38:40.920
to be presenting.

03:38:40.920 --> 03:38:44.560
Or is, Jared, are you ready to go?

03:38:46.000 --> 03:38:48.000
Yes, I just need to share so I can share.

03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:48.840
There we go.

03:38:48.840 --> 03:38:49.920
So now I'm gonna share mine.

03:38:50.760 --> 03:38:51.600
Okay.

03:38:53.920 --> 03:38:55.520
Give me one second, we pull it up.

03:39:00.040 --> 03:39:03.080
I want to also thank Superintendent Tony Thurmond

03:39:03.080 --> 03:39:04.040
and Steve Zimmer.

03:39:04.040 --> 03:39:05.920
They've been to our district twice

03:39:05.920 --> 03:39:08.040
in the last couple months

03:39:08.560 --> 03:39:09.400
to see what's going on.

03:39:09.400 --> 03:39:12.000
And I really appreciate our thought partners at UCLA

03:39:12.000 --> 03:39:14.720
really putting theory to practice

03:39:14.720 --> 03:39:17.000
and really being great thought partners

03:39:17.000 --> 03:39:19.240
on challenging our own thinking.

03:39:19.240 --> 03:39:22.720
But it's also nice to be affirmed

03:39:22.720 --> 03:39:26.160
in terms of seeing theory in action in the AUHSC.

03:39:27.360 --> 03:39:31.320
Finally, I wanted to really start this presentation

03:39:31.320 --> 03:39:34.840
about the importance of the outcap.

03:39:34.840 --> 03:39:37.400
Can you go to the next one, please?

03:39:37.400 --> 03:39:42.400
And put a shout out to Governor Brown and Mike Kurtz

03:39:42.840 --> 03:39:45.160
for and up in Linda Darling-Hammond

03:39:45.160 --> 03:39:48.320
and all those who were involved in creating the outcap.

03:39:49.320 --> 03:39:52.240
The L, as everybody knows, is local control.

03:39:52.240 --> 03:39:54.400
And I think that's really an important concept here

03:39:54.400 --> 03:39:57.640
because in terms of shared governance

03:39:57.640 --> 03:39:59.880
and bringing in all the stakeholders,

03:39:59.880 --> 03:40:01.480
including the parents and teachers

03:40:01.480 --> 03:40:04.320
and especially the student voices early on,

03:40:04.320 --> 03:40:05.640
I think that was huge

03:40:06.800 --> 03:40:09.040
because we all know that we have,

03:40:09.040 --> 03:40:11.120
those of us who are fortunate to have them,

03:40:11.120 --> 03:40:13.400
part of the $4.1 billion investment

03:40:13.400 --> 03:40:15.040
by the governor and state of California

03:40:15.040 --> 03:40:15.960
for community schools,

03:40:15.960 --> 03:40:19.640
we know that that money is limited five years.

03:40:19.640 --> 03:40:22.480
And it's really gonna be up to us to ensure

03:40:22.480 --> 03:40:27.480
that we have agency with our community.

03:40:28.200 --> 03:40:30.320
And our goal is to institutionalize this

03:40:30.320 --> 03:40:33.920
through the outcap process and the general fund five years.

03:40:33.920 --> 03:40:35.280
So it's really gonna be up to us

03:40:35.280 --> 03:40:37.160
and the community school recipients

03:40:37.160 --> 03:40:42.160
to ensure that we have our community support

03:40:42.640 --> 03:40:43.960
to make sure that that happens.

03:40:43.960 --> 03:40:44.920
Next slide, please.

03:40:47.040 --> 03:40:49.360
And I wanna put a shout out to Dr. Goley too

03:40:50.360 --> 03:40:55.360
who really informed us on the challenges of mental health,

03:40:55.960 --> 03:40:59.280
which on the ground, certainly the schools are dealing with.

03:40:59.280 --> 03:41:02.360
And the challenge really is about teaching

03:41:02.360 --> 03:41:03.880
for the whole child of mine,

03:41:03.880 --> 03:41:08.120
as Linda Dwellingham and others have long really tried

03:41:08.120 --> 03:41:10.600
to promote the role of the teacher

03:41:10.600 --> 03:41:12.400
and the role of instruction

03:41:12.400 --> 03:41:15.440
and bringing the challenges of community schools

03:41:15.440 --> 03:41:16.440
into the classroom.

03:41:16.440 --> 03:41:20.360
I think that's what we're attempting to do here.

03:41:20.360 --> 03:41:21.720
And I think what you're gonna see

03:41:21.720 --> 03:41:23.320
that we have made progress here.

03:41:24.760 --> 03:41:27.080
One of the, I think, logistical challenges

03:41:27.080 --> 03:41:28.360
of dealing with mental health

03:41:28.360 --> 03:41:31.880
is just the amount of bandwidth that schools have

03:41:31.880 --> 03:41:33.440
and communities have.

03:41:33.440 --> 03:41:36.760
We're grateful for our 25 social workers

03:41:36.760 --> 03:41:38.800
that we funded through the outcap

03:41:38.800 --> 03:41:41.520
prior to the, mostly prior to the pandemic,

03:41:41.520 --> 03:41:43.360
as well as our 85 counselors

03:41:44.640 --> 03:41:46.440
who and our social workers generally

03:41:46.440 --> 03:41:48.760
are working on the back end of this.

03:41:48.760 --> 03:41:51.680
But let's not forget, we have 1,300 teachers

03:41:51.680 --> 03:41:54.960
in the state of California, that's 250,000 teachers

03:41:54.960 --> 03:41:56.240
who could be on the front end

03:41:56.240 --> 03:42:00.360
if we can really connect deeper learning,

03:42:00.360 --> 03:42:03.400
issues of deeper learning, we call it the five Cs,

03:42:03.400 --> 03:42:08.040
to the community to give teachers the opportunity

03:42:08.040 --> 03:42:11.200
to give students and challenge them

03:42:11.200 --> 03:42:16.160
with the high learning and problem solving

03:42:16.160 --> 03:42:17.440
in our communities.

03:42:17.440 --> 03:42:19.840
Because there's no question that this generation of kids

03:42:19.840 --> 03:42:23.240
has the most severe challenges.

03:42:23.240 --> 03:42:26.480
We developed a three drivers,

03:42:26.480 --> 03:42:29.480
we call it the Career Preparedness Systems Framework.

03:42:29.640 --> 03:42:31.880
That's what all of it led to.

03:42:31.880 --> 03:42:33.840
And it's really the three drivers

03:42:33.840 --> 03:42:36.000
who are the soft skills, we call it the five Cs,

03:42:38.440 --> 03:42:40.480
which I think the state board knows

03:42:40.480 --> 03:42:43.200
that four of those Cs are already integrated

03:42:43.200 --> 03:42:45.920
and approved in the state frameworks,

03:42:45.920 --> 03:42:49.800
communication, creativity, collaboration,

03:42:49.800 --> 03:42:51.440
critical thinking, we added the fifth C,

03:42:51.440 --> 03:42:54.920
which is compassion, building a sense of empathy.

03:42:54.920 --> 03:42:57.200
The other drivers, technical skills,

03:42:57.200 --> 03:43:02.200
which are the partnerships with dual credit

03:43:02.880 --> 03:43:06.840
with our community colleges, our CTE pathways,

03:43:06.840 --> 03:43:11.840
and to provide those pathways, meaningful pathways to jobs.

03:43:12.160 --> 03:43:14.200
The third driver, which is probably the most important

03:43:14.200 --> 03:43:15.160
that people talk about,

03:43:15.160 --> 03:43:18.040
is the sense of agency purpose and voice.

03:43:18.040 --> 03:43:19.880
And a lot of this on the right side you see

03:43:19.880 --> 03:43:22.840
has led to these cutting edge pathways in agency,

03:43:22.840 --> 03:43:25.560
from AI to biotech, cyber security,

03:43:25.560 --> 03:43:27.640
we even have an incubator lab.

03:43:27.640 --> 03:43:31.400
So what the CPSF is is developing a new North Star

03:43:31.400 --> 03:43:34.720
for education based on flat governance and shared leadership.

03:43:34.720 --> 03:43:37.040
And all of this led to the development

03:43:37.040 --> 03:43:40.720
of the Magnolia Agro Science Community Center,

03:43:40.720 --> 03:43:43.560
and led by a teacher, led by a group of teachers

03:43:43.560 --> 03:43:47.840
across the district and across content areas.

03:43:47.840 --> 03:43:50.720
So at this point, I'd like to introduce our lead teacher,

03:43:50.720 --> 03:43:52.080
Dr. Sabina Jocumus.

03:43:53.080 --> 03:43:55.800
Thank you, Superintendent Matsuda.

03:43:55.800 --> 03:43:57.640
Good afternoon, everyone.

03:43:57.640 --> 03:43:58.720
I've been teaching science

03:43:58.720 --> 03:44:01.480
in the Anaheim Union High School District for 16 years,

03:44:01.480 --> 03:44:04.120
and I'm currently a teacher on special assignment

03:44:04.120 --> 03:44:07.040
overseeing the build of the Magnolia Agro Science

03:44:07.040 --> 03:44:07.880
Community Center,

03:44:07.880 --> 03:44:11.000
and also the curriculum opportunities there.

03:44:11.000 --> 03:44:13.520
So we call it the MAC Farm,

03:44:13.520 --> 03:44:17.160
and our farm is a 2.5 acre urban farm

03:44:17.160 --> 03:44:19.680
built on AUHSD property.

03:44:19.680 --> 03:44:23.280
So I'm going to address how we have authentically engaged

03:44:23.280 --> 03:44:25.920
our communities through this specific project.

03:44:25.920 --> 03:44:27.960
As we all know, the pandemic opened our eyes

03:44:27.960 --> 03:44:31.800
to the inequities in our low income communities.

03:44:31.800 --> 03:44:33.720
And our district saw a need,

03:44:33.720 --> 03:44:36.680
not only for access to fresh fruits and vegetables,

03:44:36.680 --> 03:44:39.960
but also a need for education around nutrition,

03:44:39.960 --> 03:44:42.080
how local food systems work,

03:44:42.080 --> 03:44:44.920
and urban agriculture and climate justice.

03:44:44.920 --> 03:44:46.880
So like so many of our school campuses,

03:44:46.920 --> 03:44:49.800
we had some vacant land that was not being utilized,

03:44:49.800 --> 03:44:52.560
and we saw a potential for its use.

03:44:52.560 --> 03:44:54.520
So in July, 2021,

03:44:54.520 --> 03:44:57.760
our AUHSD Board approved COVID relief funds

03:44:57.760 --> 03:45:01.640
to be used in an innovative way to build the farm,

03:45:01.640 --> 03:45:05.120
and also to fund the salaries of two full-time farmers.

03:45:05.120 --> 03:45:08.640
So I think the MAC Farm has a model of instruction

03:45:08.640 --> 03:45:11.120
that's pretty different than what you would see

03:45:11.120 --> 03:45:13.320
at most traditional school gardens.

03:45:13.320 --> 03:45:14.800
It was decided early on

03:45:14.960 --> 03:45:18.040
that we would not have a standalone class

03:45:18.040 --> 03:45:20.560
where students could sign up for a traditional course

03:45:20.560 --> 03:45:22.400
during the day, the school day.

03:45:22.400 --> 03:45:26.440
Instead, we utilized our educational partners at UC Irvine

03:45:26.440 --> 03:45:29.080
to help us create curriculum for students

03:45:29.080 --> 03:45:33.520
to experience a field trip setting at curriculum,

03:45:33.520 --> 03:45:37.040
and then also curriculum for traditional classrooms.

03:45:37.040 --> 03:45:39.560
So to date, we have had over 2,000 students

03:45:39.560 --> 03:45:40.640
from across the district

03:45:40.640 --> 03:45:43.280
come to the Magnolia Agriculture Community Center Farm

03:45:43.280 --> 03:45:45.680
to learn about regenerative farming systems,

03:45:45.680 --> 03:45:48.160
healthy ecosystems, and also growing food

03:45:48.160 --> 03:45:49.920
in a changing climate.

03:45:49.920 --> 03:45:52.920
So in the classroom, we also have teachers

03:45:53.840 --> 03:45:55.480
who teach all different subjects

03:45:55.480 --> 03:45:58.400
that are using civic engagement as a driver

03:45:58.400 --> 03:46:00.880
to help students create action projects

03:46:00.880 --> 03:46:02.600
that will engage their communities

03:46:02.600 --> 03:46:05.840
around issues of food access and climate change.

03:46:05.840 --> 03:46:08.880
And I'd like to just briefly talk about a specific example

03:46:08.880 --> 03:46:11.800
of student learning that occurred this past summer

03:46:11.800 --> 03:46:14.040
with the support of our city of Anaheim,

03:46:14.040 --> 03:46:16.720
we were able to employ AUHSD students.

03:46:16.720 --> 03:46:20.520
That means they actually got paid to work on our farm.

03:46:20.520 --> 03:46:23.160
We interviewed students from across the district

03:46:23.160 --> 03:46:28.120
and their job entailed new work skills experience

03:46:28.120 --> 03:46:30.360
utilizing our MAC farm.

03:46:30.360 --> 03:46:33.120
So these students were taught business modeling skills,

03:46:33.120 --> 03:46:36.800
marketing strategies, regenerative urban farming practices,

03:46:36.800 --> 03:46:39.240
and also community outreach tools.

03:46:39.240 --> 03:46:42.240
So our AUHSD students were able to monetize

03:46:42.240 --> 03:46:45.200
their business model of selling produce boxes

03:46:45.200 --> 03:46:46.800
to communities in need,

03:46:46.800 --> 03:46:49.520
which also gave them the skills that they would need

03:46:49.520 --> 03:46:52.520
to improve a local economy when they graduate.

03:46:52.520 --> 03:46:55.640
So this is just one example of a program at the MAC farm

03:46:55.640 --> 03:46:58.240
that happened during the traditional school day

03:46:58.240 --> 03:47:00.880
or traditional summer school time

03:47:00.880 --> 03:47:03.840
where students have access to innovative curriculum

03:47:03.840 --> 03:47:05.560
taught by teacher leaders.

03:47:05.560 --> 03:47:06.400
Thank you.

03:47:10.160 --> 03:47:13.520
So what Samina described as a new way of doing school,

03:47:13.520 --> 03:47:16.280
no longer is it just happening in one classroom

03:47:16.280 --> 03:47:17.800
or even one school.

03:47:17.800 --> 03:47:19.880
Our concept of community schools

03:47:19.880 --> 03:47:24.880
is widening the aperture of access for students

03:47:24.960 --> 03:47:28.000
to these amazing opportunities by our teachers

03:47:28.000 --> 03:47:30.920
and also through our partners with community colleges

03:47:30.920 --> 03:47:32.680
and the four year institutions

03:47:32.680 --> 03:47:37.040
as well as over 90 business and nonprofit partners.

03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:41.000
And it's all centered around the student

03:47:41.000 --> 03:47:44.000
developing 21st century skills, the technical skills,

03:47:44.000 --> 03:47:45.400
and the use of voice and purpose.

03:47:45.400 --> 03:47:48.720
It's really, really, I think an amazing testament

03:47:48.720 --> 03:47:52.800
to the collaboration and shared leadership of teachers,

03:47:52.800 --> 03:47:55.320
parents, and district and students

03:47:55.320 --> 03:47:57.720
working together for this new vision.

03:47:57.720 --> 03:48:00.960
At this point, I'd like to introduce

03:48:00.960 --> 03:48:03.160
one of our parent leaders

03:48:03.240 --> 03:48:07.320
involved in our community school steering committee

03:48:07.320 --> 03:48:10.440
and she's just, she'll speak to the work

03:48:10.440 --> 03:48:13.560
of the community school steering committee.

03:48:13.560 --> 03:48:14.560
Thank you.

03:48:14.560 --> 03:48:15.680
Jessie Alvarez.

03:48:16.760 --> 03:48:18.040
Hi, thank you.

03:48:18.040 --> 03:48:19.440
So again, my name is Jessie Alvarez

03:48:19.440 --> 03:48:20.440
and I am a parent member

03:48:20.440 --> 03:48:23.320
of our district community school steering committee.

03:48:23.320 --> 03:48:24.840
We have built our model and approach

03:48:24.840 --> 03:48:26.640
on collaborative shared leadership

03:48:26.640 --> 03:48:28.160
and that really makes this work different

03:48:28.160 --> 03:48:30.440
from how we've traditionally seen school systems

03:48:30.520 --> 03:48:31.840
operate in the past.

03:48:31.840 --> 03:48:33.400
And as was emphasized earlier,

03:48:33.400 --> 03:48:36.520
it's what makes this truly transformational work.

03:48:36.520 --> 03:48:38.560
Our 20 member district steering committee

03:48:38.560 --> 03:48:41.640
is composed of union leadership, district leadership,

03:48:41.640 --> 03:48:44.600
representatives from our community school coordinators

03:48:44.600 --> 03:48:46.560
and community school teacher leads,

03:48:46.560 --> 03:48:49.560
parents, students, and community partners.

03:48:49.560 --> 03:48:51.840
We bring our expertise and insights

03:48:51.840 --> 03:48:55.880
to help create and support systems at our school sites.

03:48:55.880 --> 03:48:59.560
The meetings are co-chaired by the union and the district.

03:48:59.560 --> 03:49:01.400
We are intentional about making sure

03:49:01.400 --> 03:49:02.680
we are including the voices

03:49:02.680 --> 03:49:04.760
of all of our education partners

03:49:04.760 --> 03:49:06.560
and at the district committee level

03:49:06.560 --> 03:49:08.000
and at our site level

03:49:08.000 --> 03:49:11.320
so that we are truly representing the communities we serve.

03:49:11.320 --> 03:49:12.720
Our community schools approach

03:49:12.720 --> 03:49:15.640
began with a small initial pilot grant we received

03:49:15.640 --> 03:49:18.920
that funded our first two community school coordinators

03:49:18.920 --> 03:49:22.320
that has led us to our shared leadership model journey.

03:49:22.320 --> 03:49:25.360
This began with a grant through NEA and our teachers union

03:49:25.360 --> 03:49:27.560
and is what fueled the district steering committee

03:49:27.560 --> 03:49:30.160
to develop community school teacher leads

03:49:30.160 --> 03:49:32.120
at each of our sites.

03:49:32.120 --> 03:49:36.400
This shared leadership model isn't just on paper.

03:49:36.400 --> 03:49:38.520
It's put into action with every discussion

03:49:38.520 --> 03:49:40.480
and step we take as a committee.

03:49:40.480 --> 03:49:42.760
For instance, today, I'm a parent on our committee.

03:49:42.760 --> 03:49:44.560
I'm not an employee of the district

03:49:44.560 --> 03:49:47.960
and I have no formal training in educational leadership.

03:49:47.960 --> 03:49:49.600
But this model gives every group,

03:49:49.600 --> 03:49:51.640
including the parents, agency to co-lead

03:49:51.640 --> 03:49:53.680
and be part of the decision-making.

03:49:53.680 --> 03:49:55.800
The district trusts our expertise as parents

03:49:55.840 --> 03:49:58.280
and sees us as assets to our schools.

03:49:58.280 --> 03:50:01.120
I'm also a product of our district

03:50:01.120 --> 03:50:03.920
having attended both of our flagship community schools,

03:50:03.920 --> 03:50:06.400
Sycamore Junior High and Anaheim High School.

03:50:06.400 --> 03:50:09.240
My son is currently a freshman at Anaheim High School.

03:50:10.200 --> 03:50:13.080
In looking at continuing to build more partnerships

03:50:13.080 --> 03:50:15.120
and sustainability, we recently presented

03:50:15.120 --> 03:50:16.800
at the Anaheim City Council meeting

03:50:16.800 --> 03:50:20.080
with speakers from each of our education partners.

03:50:20.080 --> 03:50:21.800
Pictured here is Akali Huerta,

03:50:21.800 --> 03:50:23.000
our community school coordinator

03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:24.640
at Sycamore Junior High School,

03:50:24.680 --> 03:50:26.920
myself and my amazing niece, Emma,

03:50:26.920 --> 03:50:29.600
who is a student leader at Sycamore Junior High.

03:50:29.600 --> 03:50:31.720
She spoke about the importance of this model

03:50:31.720 --> 03:50:33.240
and the positive impact it has

03:50:33.240 --> 03:50:36.960
and will continue to have on her and her peers at Sycamore.

03:50:36.960 --> 03:50:39.080
We were able to engage members of the council

03:50:39.080 --> 03:50:40.880
in a way we have not seen before.

03:50:40.880 --> 03:50:43.600
We were truly interested in the work we are doing

03:50:43.600 --> 03:50:45.560
and unanimously passed a resolution

03:50:45.560 --> 03:50:47.600
in support of community schools.

03:50:47.600 --> 03:50:48.920
This resolution is important

03:50:48.920 --> 03:50:51.280
because it will allow members of the city council

03:50:51.280 --> 03:50:53.960
and city staff to advocate for programs

03:50:54.120 --> 03:50:57.240
and services that support our community school efforts.

03:50:57.240 --> 03:50:59.800
As a parent, I'm deeply invested in the success

03:50:59.800 --> 03:51:01.000
of not just my sons,

03:51:01.000 --> 03:51:03.440
but of all of our students within our district.

03:51:03.440 --> 03:51:05.960
We see the challenges that our students are facing daily

03:51:05.960 --> 03:51:09.600
and we have to school differently than we have in the past.

03:51:09.600 --> 03:51:10.920
Our students are the future

03:51:10.920 --> 03:51:13.720
and we need to all come together as a community of partners

03:51:13.720 --> 03:51:15.120
to ensure their success.

03:51:18.040 --> 03:51:18.880
Thank you, Jessie.

03:51:18.880 --> 03:51:19.700
I'm gonna go ahead and take over.

03:51:19.700 --> 03:51:20.540
I'm Dr. Jared Fried.

03:51:20.540 --> 03:51:22.240
I proudly serve as the assistant superintendent

03:51:22.240 --> 03:51:24.200
of educational services for our great district.

03:51:24.200 --> 03:51:26.400
And I wanna thank Jessie for her leadership and great work.

03:51:26.400 --> 03:51:28.480
And I also wanna give a shout out to our steering committee.

03:51:28.480 --> 03:51:30.000
They're actually meeting right now as we speak,

03:51:30.000 --> 03:51:30.840
probably watching this,

03:51:30.840 --> 03:51:32.920
but they're just an amazing group of people

03:51:32.920 --> 03:51:34.760
who are leading our district through this journey

03:51:34.760 --> 03:51:36.080
and helping us navigate

03:51:36.080 --> 03:51:38.000
in the implementation of our community school approach.

03:51:38.000 --> 03:51:40.760
So I wanna give them all a big kudos and thanks,

03:51:40.760 --> 03:51:42.600
heartfelt thank you.

03:51:42.600 --> 03:51:43.440
These core values,

03:51:43.440 --> 03:51:45.480
in addition to the four pillars

03:51:45.480 --> 03:51:47.160
that we have to examine closely

03:51:47.160 --> 03:51:49.240
in terms of how to really build out our community school

03:51:49.240 --> 03:51:51.840
approach, we also look at our district's core values

03:51:52.520 --> 03:51:53.360
and making sure that all the decisions we make

03:51:53.360 --> 03:51:54.560
and the work that we do are connected

03:51:54.560 --> 03:51:56.120
to what we deeply believe in.

03:51:56.120 --> 03:51:58.520
And through this presentation and also throughout my part

03:51:58.520 --> 03:51:59.680
and what I'm gonna be speaking about,

03:51:59.680 --> 03:52:01.400
I'm gonna make some connections to these values

03:52:01.400 --> 03:52:03.000
and how it drives our work.

03:52:04.320 --> 03:52:06.920
As Mike talked about this concept of shared leadership

03:52:06.920 --> 03:52:10.080
in the CPSF or the career preparedness systems framework,

03:52:10.080 --> 03:52:12.880
we really have taken a heart in that one pillar

03:52:12.880 --> 03:52:13.880
that it talks about expanded

03:52:13.880 --> 03:52:16.000
and enriching learning opportunities.

03:52:16.000 --> 03:52:18.120
We really do believe that for the sustainability

03:52:18.120 --> 03:52:20.680
of this grant, if and when the money should dry up,

03:52:20.720 --> 03:52:22.480
that it's gonna be the work that we've done

03:52:22.480 --> 03:52:23.760
to build capacity in our teachers

03:52:23.760 --> 03:52:25.840
and integrate these concepts in our classroom.

03:52:25.840 --> 03:52:27.720
And Dr. Darling-Hammond, you mentioned this earlier

03:52:27.720 --> 03:52:29.320
when our earlier presentation took place.

03:52:29.320 --> 03:52:31.600
That's really where the transformation takes place.

03:52:31.600 --> 03:52:32.880
We couldn't agree more.

03:52:32.880 --> 03:52:34.520
So we have invested monies.

03:52:34.520 --> 03:52:35.440
It was part of our LCAP,

03:52:35.440 --> 03:52:37.120
but also part of the community school efforts

03:52:37.120 --> 03:52:39.040
to really build capacity in our teacher leaders.

03:52:39.040 --> 03:52:41.000
So we're looking at the way that we approach teaching

03:52:41.000 --> 03:52:43.600
and learning to integrate local, statewide

03:52:43.600 --> 03:52:45.520
and national issues into the classroom

03:52:45.520 --> 03:52:47.360
while connecting it back to the content.

03:52:47.360 --> 03:52:49.280
So we're not sacrificing the traditional content

03:52:49.320 --> 03:52:51.040
all the while building these skillsets

03:52:51.040 --> 03:52:52.720
in our students and in our families

03:52:52.720 --> 03:52:55.680
so that this work is sustained when this grant is over

03:52:55.680 --> 03:52:56.800
or if it doesn't over,

03:52:56.800 --> 03:52:59.040
we're just gonna continue to grow out this model

03:52:59.040 --> 03:53:00.320
and continue to meet the needs

03:53:00.320 --> 03:53:02.400
and celebrate the assets of our community.

03:53:02.400 --> 03:53:04.680
So this is an example of how that might look.

03:53:04.680 --> 03:53:07.160
Now, also, I know that you may not see this perfectly,

03:53:07.160 --> 03:53:08.560
but this is just an example

03:53:08.560 --> 03:53:10.680
of the systems not silos approach.

03:53:10.680 --> 03:53:13.320
We really do believe in creating structures and systems.

03:53:13.320 --> 03:53:14.840
So again, this work is independent

03:53:14.840 --> 03:53:16.520
upon one person or two people.

03:53:16.520 --> 03:53:19.120
If someone leaves, the work can continue.

03:53:19.960 --> 03:53:21.440
And so baked into our learning organization

03:53:21.440 --> 03:53:22.840
and the systems and structures

03:53:22.840 --> 03:53:24.520
are our community school structures.

03:53:24.520 --> 03:53:25.680
So you can see in this model,

03:53:25.680 --> 03:53:27.400
we have our district steering committee.

03:53:27.400 --> 03:53:29.800
We have our community school coordinator structures.

03:53:29.800 --> 03:53:31.160
We have the structures for our community school

03:53:31.160 --> 03:53:32.960
teacher leads in the work that we're doing

03:53:32.960 --> 03:53:33.800
across our system.

03:53:33.800 --> 03:53:35.480
So this is really essential for us.

03:53:35.480 --> 03:53:37.160
So again, it's that shared practice,

03:53:37.160 --> 03:53:39.160
shared leadership model where we're all working together

03:53:39.160 --> 03:53:40.680
and not in silos.

03:53:41.720 --> 03:53:43.200
Now, how do we know that this is working?

03:53:43.200 --> 03:53:44.520
Because as Mike said earlier,

03:53:44.520 --> 03:53:45.840
we've been doing some of this work

03:53:45.840 --> 03:53:47.440
prior to this grant opportunity.

03:53:47.440 --> 03:53:48.880
And now we're being able to take that

03:53:49.720 --> 03:53:51.600
and really strengthen the work that we've begun.

03:53:51.600 --> 03:53:53.120
This is just some data that just shares

03:53:53.120 --> 03:53:53.960
the work that we're doing.

03:53:53.960 --> 03:53:56.120
We know is making an impact on our students

03:53:56.120 --> 03:53:57.160
and our families.

03:53:57.160 --> 03:53:58.800
Without going over all the data specifics,

03:53:58.800 --> 03:53:59.640
I know you can see it.

03:53:59.640 --> 03:54:02.080
I do wanna highlight the state seal of civic engagement,

03:54:02.080 --> 03:54:03.400
because that's what we're looking to bring

03:54:03.400 --> 03:54:05.160
into our classrooms each and every day

03:54:05.160 --> 03:54:07.360
that allow our students to engage in the content,

03:54:07.360 --> 03:54:08.600
develop those skills,

03:54:08.600 --> 03:54:10.640
but also look at the applied learning

03:54:10.640 --> 03:54:13.240
and problem solving that we wanna develop in them.

03:54:13.240 --> 03:54:15.400
And the first year that the state seal was given,

03:54:15.400 --> 03:54:19.000
we had 2,400 plus students earn the state seal.

03:54:19.000 --> 03:54:21.960
That's 45% of all the state seals

03:54:21.960 --> 03:54:24.240
that were given across the state.

03:54:24.240 --> 03:54:27.360
Now in the year two, we're now over 2,800 students.

03:54:27.360 --> 03:54:29.080
So we're really proud that we're integrating

03:54:29.080 --> 03:54:30.280
this approach into our classroom.

03:54:30.280 --> 03:54:32.440
We have 17 California democracy schools.

03:54:32.440 --> 03:54:34.800
So that means every single student on that campus

03:54:34.800 --> 03:54:37.360
gets to experience a civic engagement project.

03:54:37.360 --> 03:54:38.880
It's not just learning about civic heads,

03:54:38.880 --> 03:54:40.680
but it's applying it through action.

03:54:40.680 --> 03:54:42.160
So we're really proud of the work that we're doing.

03:54:42.160 --> 03:54:45.080
And this is part of our community school approach.

03:54:45.120 --> 03:54:46.120
And then here's some other data.

03:54:46.120 --> 03:54:47.560
As you know, we have an articulated agreement

03:54:47.560 --> 03:54:50.000
with our higher education partners, UC Irvine,

03:54:50.000 --> 03:54:52.880
Cal State Fullerton, Cypress, and Fullerton College.

03:54:52.880 --> 03:54:54.440
And although this is UC Irvine's data,

03:54:54.440 --> 03:54:55.560
the data looks comparable

03:54:55.560 --> 03:54:57.000
across those other college partners.

03:54:57.000 --> 03:54:58.680
And we're seeing that our students

03:54:58.680 --> 03:55:00.320
who are enrolling at these institutions

03:55:00.320 --> 03:55:02.920
are not just outperforming in terms of their GPA,

03:55:02.920 --> 03:55:05.080
but they are also out persisting.

03:55:05.080 --> 03:55:06.640
They have a higher retention rate

03:55:06.640 --> 03:55:07.800
than students across the state

03:55:07.800 --> 03:55:09.160
who enter these institutions.

03:55:09.160 --> 03:55:11.160
And when we talk to our higher ed deans

03:55:11.160 --> 03:55:13.680
and vice presidents of instruction and presidents,

03:55:13.680 --> 03:55:15.280
they tell us time and time again,

03:55:15.280 --> 03:55:16.920
as a result of our drivers,

03:55:16.920 --> 03:55:19.520
the result that we give our students purpose and agency,

03:55:19.520 --> 03:55:21.520
that we make sure education works for them

03:55:21.520 --> 03:55:22.840
and not the other way around.

03:55:22.840 --> 03:55:24.760
And that we're activating their voice

03:55:24.760 --> 03:55:26.840
and we're connected to the 5C.

03:55:26.840 --> 03:55:27.880
So it's just another tribute

03:55:27.880 --> 03:55:29.680
that the work that we're doing is making the impact

03:55:29.680 --> 03:55:31.240
that we would hope that it would make

03:55:31.240 --> 03:55:32.720
with and for our students.

03:55:33.640 --> 03:55:36.160
And then lastly, we've been asked to talk a little bit

03:55:36.160 --> 03:55:38.200
of how you as a State Board of Education

03:55:38.200 --> 03:55:41.040
can support our efforts in the way that we implement

03:55:41.080 --> 03:55:43.600
our community school approach through tactical assistance.

03:55:43.600 --> 03:55:45.760
And I love what Karen said earlier,

03:55:45.760 --> 03:55:47.360
our friend and partner at UCLA,

03:55:47.360 --> 03:55:48.560
it's not tactical assistance,

03:55:48.560 --> 03:55:50.520
we see this as transformational support.

03:55:50.520 --> 03:55:53.320
It really is helping us redesign our schools

03:55:53.320 --> 03:55:55.120
so that way it can work for our students

03:55:55.120 --> 03:55:56.760
and for our communities.

03:55:56.760 --> 03:55:59.640
We believe if you could help remove some of the red tape

03:55:59.640 --> 03:56:02.120
or the bureaucracy that schools often are faced with.

03:56:02.120 --> 03:56:03.800
So many of our districts who have asked us

03:56:03.800 --> 03:56:05.320
they want to do this work,

03:56:05.320 --> 03:56:07.600
they're often focused on teaching to a test

03:56:07.600 --> 03:56:09.800
that doesn't promote the kind of student

03:56:09.800 --> 03:56:11.160
that they're looking to become

03:56:11.160 --> 03:56:13.560
to be able to succeed in life beyond school.

03:56:13.560 --> 03:56:16.160
How can we liberate our sites, liberate our teachers

03:56:16.160 --> 03:56:19.280
so that way they really do feel compelled and supported

03:56:19.280 --> 03:56:20.960
in really teaching to meet the needs

03:56:20.960 --> 03:56:23.480
and the assets of our students.

03:56:23.480 --> 03:56:25.680
Through this end, we've talked about

03:56:25.680 --> 03:56:27.040
one of the things that we could have support with

03:56:27.040 --> 03:56:29.680
is through the creation of a ninth element

03:56:29.680 --> 03:56:32.440
on their college career indicator on the dashboard.

03:56:32.440 --> 03:56:34.600
I love how our friends at UCLA talked about

03:56:34.600 --> 03:56:35.600
this growth model.

03:56:35.600 --> 03:56:37.440
Well, in our district and I know in so many other districts,

03:56:37.440 --> 03:56:38.920
they have capstone programs

03:56:38.960 --> 03:56:40.600
or graduate or senior profiles

03:56:40.600 --> 03:56:44.120
where it's not worksheets in basic assignments.

03:56:44.120 --> 03:56:46.200
These are performance task assessments

03:56:46.200 --> 03:56:47.720
and project-based learning assignments

03:56:47.720 --> 03:56:50.040
connected to the work that students are engaged in

03:56:50.040 --> 03:56:52.000
in classroom every day where they're reflecting

03:56:52.000 --> 03:56:53.480
upon the skills that they're learning,

03:56:53.480 --> 03:56:54.720
the content of the learning

03:56:54.720 --> 03:56:57.400
and how they're finding their place in this role.

03:56:57.400 --> 03:56:59.200
That could be a part of that structure

03:56:59.200 --> 03:57:00.840
that allows schools to really focus

03:57:00.840 --> 03:57:02.840
on what we believe to be the right drivers

03:57:02.840 --> 03:57:04.400
in our North Star.

03:57:04.400 --> 03:57:07.280
This is applied learning and problem solving at its best,

03:57:07.280 --> 03:57:09.360
which you saw an example of what's happening

03:57:09.360 --> 03:57:10.720
at our Mac Farm.

03:57:10.720 --> 03:57:12.240
We also would love the opportunities

03:57:12.240 --> 03:57:14.040
as our friends at UCLA also talked about

03:57:14.040 --> 03:57:15.360
to create these innovation zones

03:57:15.360 --> 03:57:16.720
or these innovation spaces

03:57:16.720 --> 03:57:18.840
where through those leadership partners,

03:57:18.840 --> 03:57:20.280
we can connect with other districts

03:57:20.280 --> 03:57:21.520
who are engaging in this work,

03:57:21.520 --> 03:57:23.480
where we can learn from each other

03:57:23.480 --> 03:57:24.680
and share our best practices,

03:57:24.680 --> 03:57:26.320
but we can also be vulnerable together

03:57:26.320 --> 03:57:27.560
and share some of the challenges

03:57:27.560 --> 03:57:29.760
and use these thought partners to help grow

03:57:29.760 --> 03:57:31.920
and strengthen the gaps that we might have

03:57:31.920 --> 03:57:33.520
within our system.

03:57:33.520 --> 03:57:35.920
We also wanna, just before we end,

03:57:35.920 --> 03:57:37.680
thank again our thought partners at UCLA.

03:57:37.680 --> 03:57:39.480
They've been a tremendous help to our team.

03:57:39.480 --> 03:57:41.320
I know Karen personally, along with Marisa,

03:57:41.320 --> 03:57:42.800
has been really helpful in supporting

03:57:42.800 --> 03:57:44.440
our district steering committee team

03:57:44.440 --> 03:57:45.560
and the work that's happening.

03:57:45.560 --> 03:57:47.960
I also wanna thank you, the State Board of Education,

03:57:47.960 --> 03:57:50.560
as we close, for this amazing, amazing opportunity

03:57:50.560 --> 03:57:53.480
that you have given us in districts and schools

03:57:53.480 --> 03:57:55.120
throughout our state.

03:57:55.120 --> 03:57:57.160
It is our hope that we can take advantage

03:57:57.160 --> 03:57:59.960
of this transformational opportunity that you have given

03:57:59.960 --> 03:58:02.960
to really make sure that we first accelerate, celebrate

03:58:02.960 --> 03:58:05.040
and build upon the many assets and strengths

03:58:05.040 --> 03:58:07.200
that our schools, our staff, our students

03:58:07.200 --> 03:58:09.120
and our families bring to the table each and every day,

03:58:09.120 --> 03:58:10.800
but also use this money to leverage

03:58:10.800 --> 03:58:12.320
to close the gaps that might exist.

03:58:12.320 --> 03:58:14.240
So we're really working towards that needle

03:58:14.240 --> 03:58:16.320
and moving towards equity and justice.

03:58:16.320 --> 03:58:18.160
So with that, I wanna thank you for this opportunity.

03:58:18.160 --> 03:58:20.120
I'll turn it back over to Dr. Darlene Hammond

03:58:20.120 --> 03:58:21.240
and our team is happy to answer

03:58:21.240 --> 03:58:22.640
any questions you might have.

03:58:26.000 --> 03:58:26.960
I think you're muted.

03:58:26.960 --> 03:58:28.280
I am.

03:58:28.280 --> 03:58:30.480
Thank you for that inspiring presentation.

03:58:30.480 --> 03:58:33.320
I know we all really appreciated it.

03:58:33.320 --> 03:58:34.960
And I see a hand going up,

03:58:34.960 --> 03:58:37.360
but we do have a little bit more presentation

03:58:37.360 --> 03:58:40.680
coming from the State Department.

03:58:40.680 --> 03:58:43.760
And then I think we can turn to questions at that time.

03:58:43.760 --> 03:58:45.880
So I'm hoping that the Anaheim team

03:58:45.880 --> 03:58:47.600
can stay with us a little bit longer.

03:58:47.600 --> 03:58:49.520
Is that okay?

03:58:49.520 --> 03:58:50.840
Great.

03:58:50.840 --> 03:58:54.880
And we really appreciate all that you presented.

03:58:54.880 --> 03:58:57.040
So we're gonna turn back to our CDE colleagues

03:58:57.040 --> 03:58:59.560
for the final part of the presentation.

03:58:59.560 --> 03:59:01.960
I think Steve Zimmer and Pete Callis

03:59:01.960 --> 03:59:03.760
are going to help us through that.

03:59:03.760 --> 03:59:06.200
And then we'll open up to everyone

03:59:06.200 --> 03:59:08.280
for questions and comments.

03:59:08.280 --> 03:59:09.720
Thank you so much.

03:59:09.720 --> 03:59:10.560
Thank you.

03:59:10.560 --> 03:59:14.200
Thank you so much, Dr. Darlene Hammond and board members.

03:59:14.200 --> 03:59:19.200
I wanna thank all of our presenters today.

03:59:20.360 --> 03:59:25.160
Superintendent Matsuda, Dr. Freed, Ms. Alvarez

03:59:25.160 --> 03:59:30.160
and Dr. Giacomis, this is an inspiring presentation.

03:59:32.040 --> 03:59:36.520
From the Anaheim Union, our S-TAC partners,

03:59:36.520 --> 03:59:40.560
Dr. Purwall and Dr. Hunter Quartz.

03:59:40.560 --> 03:59:43.720
The work as you can see is accelerating

03:59:43.720 --> 03:59:48.400
and we're so grateful to the S-TAC for their partnership

03:59:48.400 --> 03:59:50.320
for the integrated work that they're doing.

03:59:50.320 --> 03:59:55.200
And of course to Dr. Ghali and CYBHI director,

03:59:55.200 --> 04:00:00.200
Melissa Safford-Jones for really bringing us

04:00:00.240 --> 04:00:03.520
an incredible possibility of what can be

04:00:03.520 --> 04:00:06.400
when these two historic initiatives

04:00:06.400 --> 04:00:09.440
work together synergistically.

04:00:09.440 --> 04:00:14.440
I'm joined today by our division director, Pete Callis,

04:00:14.600 --> 04:00:19.400
our senior advisor to the superintendent, Brooklyn Williams.

04:00:19.400 --> 04:00:22.240
And the message, I apologize,

04:00:22.240 --> 04:00:24.640
there's a little bit of a shadow on my screen.

04:00:24.640 --> 04:00:27.560
There's something, the camera's malfunctioning a little bit,

04:00:27.640 --> 04:00:28.800
but I don't want you to think

04:00:28.800 --> 04:00:30.640
that there's anything ominous.

04:00:30.640 --> 04:00:33.920
The news around community schools is positive

04:00:34.840 --> 04:00:37.760
and is inspiring.

04:00:38.720 --> 04:00:42.000
You saw an incredible example here today

04:00:42.000 --> 04:00:45.320
with the Anaheim Union, the superintendent and I have,

04:00:45.320 --> 04:00:49.280
Superintendent Thurmond and I have had the chance to visit.

04:00:49.280 --> 04:00:54.040
Twice this year, we visited Dr. Escobedo and I

04:00:54.080 --> 04:00:57.800
and the superintendent visited the school in Vista Unified

04:00:57.800 --> 04:01:00.080
just a couple of weeks ago.

04:01:00.080 --> 04:01:02.400
And we are hearing from schools

04:01:02.400 --> 04:01:04.040
and LEAs throughout the state.

04:01:04.040 --> 04:01:07.960
I want you to know that the division is happening.

04:01:07.960 --> 04:01:10.280
It is being implemented.

04:01:10.280 --> 04:01:15.280
We have all throughout our states teams of families

04:01:17.240 --> 04:01:20.360
of staff members, of students doing assets

04:01:20.360 --> 04:01:23.920
and strength assessments and gap analysis.

04:01:24.800 --> 04:01:28.200
We have a shared decision-making councils coming together

04:01:28.200 --> 04:01:31.160
and we have rich and deep and robust

04:01:32.120 --> 04:01:37.120
and different positions about changing our school climates.

04:01:38.480 --> 04:01:43.480
Those are happening 458 school sites throughout the state

04:01:43.680 --> 04:01:45.680
and with implementation grants,

04:01:45.680 --> 04:01:49.880
172 LEAs with planning grants.

04:01:49.880 --> 04:01:54.760
And today is the next step in that process.

04:01:54.760 --> 04:01:59.760
We're going to ask you to the board to approve

04:02:00.400 --> 04:02:03.880
two critical elements of our movement forward.

04:02:03.880 --> 04:02:07.240
First, the recommendation to approve

04:02:07.240 --> 04:02:09.040
our updated administrative plan.

04:02:09.040 --> 04:02:13.000
I will note, I'll explain this in detail in a later slide.

04:02:13.000 --> 04:02:17.600
There is a slight revision to that administrative plan

04:02:18.280 --> 04:02:22.200
that I will explain related to our COE allocations.

04:02:22.200 --> 04:02:24.960
I'll explain that in the last slide.

04:02:24.960 --> 04:02:26.840
So we'll ask you for approval

04:02:26.840 --> 04:02:28.800
of the updated administration plan.

04:02:28.800 --> 04:02:32.880
And also critically, we'll recommend the approval

04:02:32.880 --> 04:02:37.880
of the grants for the regional technical assistance centers.

04:02:37.960 --> 04:02:41.840
And right now I'm gonna hand it over with my great thanks

04:02:41.840 --> 04:02:44.600
to division director Pete Callis

04:02:44.600 --> 04:02:48.560
who has been our partner in implementing this program.

04:02:48.560 --> 04:02:49.400
Pete.

04:02:59.680 --> 04:03:01.400
Federal funding to administer

04:03:01.400 --> 04:03:04.920
the California Community Schools Partnership Program

04:03:04.920 --> 04:03:07.360
for existing California community schools.

04:03:08.780 --> 04:03:10.100
This was expanded.

04:03:10.100 --> 04:03:13.040
The program for community schools was expanded

04:03:13.040 --> 04:03:17.200
and continued with CDE receiving over $3.1 million

04:03:17.200 --> 04:03:21.440
in 2021-22 state budget to expand

04:03:21.440 --> 04:03:24.120
the California Community Schools Partnership Program

04:03:24.120 --> 04:03:27.640
for new schools and for existing community schools

04:03:27.640 --> 04:03:31.960
through planning grants and implementation grants.

04:03:35.880 --> 04:03:39.840
Moving into 2022-23, the legislature allocated

04:03:39.840 --> 04:03:42.600
additional funding for the CCSPP

04:03:43.160 --> 04:03:47.200
which includes an additional $1.1 plus billion

04:03:47.200 --> 04:03:50.520
to be used beginning in 2023-24

04:03:50.520 --> 04:03:54.560
for additional implementation grants and extension grants.

04:03:54.560 --> 04:03:58.280
Another $2.5 million for formative evaluation

04:03:58.280 --> 04:04:03.280
in 2023 through 2027, $140 million

04:04:03.320 --> 04:04:07.160
for community office of education coordination grants

04:04:07.160 --> 04:04:11.080
to support LEAs within their county

04:04:11.080 --> 04:04:15.800
with implementation of their community school grant programs.

04:04:15.800 --> 04:04:20.800
$350,000 for an interim technical assistance contract.

04:04:21.400 --> 04:04:26.400
$742,000 annually for a community schools office within CDE.

04:04:27.600 --> 04:04:32.720
And finally, the program was extended from 2028-29

04:04:32.720 --> 04:04:36.640
to 2030-31 through the end of that year.

04:04:37.120 --> 04:04:39.720
And then Steve, back to you.

04:04:39.720 --> 04:04:42.040
Yes, so thank you, Pete.

04:04:42.040 --> 04:04:45.680
And today, as noted, we'll ask you to approve

04:04:45.680 --> 04:04:50.040
the applications for the Regional Technical Assistance Center,

04:04:50.040 --> 04:04:52.160
Fresno County Office of Education,

04:04:52.160 --> 04:04:55.760
LA County Office of Education, Monterey County,

04:04:55.760 --> 04:04:58.600
Sacramento County, San Bernardino County,

04:04:58.600 --> 04:05:01.320
San Diego County, Santa Clara County,

04:05:01.320 --> 04:05:04.120
and Shasta County Office of Education.

04:05:04.120 --> 04:05:07.280
And I'll refer board members to the item

04:05:07.280 --> 04:05:09.640
where we've listed not only the regions

04:05:09.640 --> 04:05:13.240
that we developed and rationale for those regions,

04:05:13.240 --> 04:05:18.240
but also the partnerships that are part of these RTAGs.

04:05:21.080 --> 04:05:25.280
And so it will give you a little bit more information

04:05:25.280 --> 04:05:28.280
about the RTAGs in the item,

04:05:28.280 --> 04:05:33.280
but these are, we feel very confident in the RTAGs

04:05:33.280 --> 04:05:35.360
and confident in the recommendation

04:05:35.360 --> 04:05:38.320
that we're making today that the work of the STAC

04:05:38.320 --> 04:05:43.320
that Dr. Purwall and Dr. Hunter-Courts outlined today

04:05:45.400 --> 04:05:50.400
can be implemented with fidelity on the ground

04:05:50.640 --> 04:05:55.640
with these demonstrated in their application

04:05:56.360 --> 04:06:00.920
knowledge of the issues on the ground in the region

04:06:00.920 --> 04:06:04.280
with the great diversity of our states.

04:06:04.280 --> 04:06:09.280
We'll ask for your approval of these RTAG awards today.

04:06:10.240 --> 04:06:11.080
Next slide please.

04:06:13.560 --> 04:06:18.000
And so we'll also talk through the administration plan

04:06:18.000 --> 04:06:23.000
and that you will also find in greater detail in the item.

04:06:24.080 --> 04:06:28.760
This plan includes an interim technical assistance plan

04:06:28.760 --> 04:06:32.560
through the STAC, extending our contract with WestEd

04:06:32.560 --> 04:06:34.400
and our team at STDE.

04:06:34.400 --> 04:06:37.600
I'll talk about this in a little bit more detail.

04:06:37.600 --> 04:06:40.720
The way that the calendar has aligned

04:06:40.720 --> 04:06:45.720
and we are extremely grateful to the STAC for jumping in

04:06:46.560 --> 04:06:51.120
and being immediately just accelerating that on-ramp

04:06:51.120 --> 04:06:52.360
to their involvement.

04:06:52.360 --> 04:06:55.560
We anticipate the same will happen with our RTAGs,

04:06:55.560 --> 04:06:58.280
but we understand for this first cohort,

04:06:58.280 --> 04:06:59.960
it was essential to have

04:06:59.960 --> 04:07:02.440
an interim technical assistance plan.

04:07:02.440 --> 04:07:04.720
I'll talk to you about the County Office

04:07:04.720 --> 04:07:06.720
of Education Coordination Grants.

04:07:06.720 --> 04:07:08.120
And again, as I mentioned,

04:07:08.120 --> 04:07:12.560
we're going to make a slight adjustment to our asks.

04:07:12.560 --> 04:07:16.960
We need to re-examine a few fine points of the data

04:07:16.960 --> 04:07:18.600
on our figures there,

04:07:18.600 --> 04:07:21.360
but I'll talk to you about the importance of this grant.

04:07:21.360 --> 04:07:26.040
And then we have two RFAs that are coming up.

04:07:26.040 --> 04:07:30.200
We released the RFA for the planning grant

04:07:31.320 --> 04:07:33.840
and the due date for that,

04:07:33.840 --> 04:07:37.600
the next round of the planning grant will be December 20th.

04:07:37.600 --> 04:07:42.600
And then we will release in January the due date,

04:07:42.760 --> 04:07:47.440
we will release the second round implementation grant.

04:07:47.440 --> 04:07:52.240
Also part of our administration process

04:07:52.240 --> 04:07:56.160
is the formative evaluation RFA,

04:07:56.160 --> 04:07:59.080
which will also be issued in the first quarter

04:07:59.080 --> 04:08:03.080
in January of 2023.

04:08:03.080 --> 04:08:07.440
And then our outreach efforts with which Brooklyn Williams

04:08:07.440 --> 04:08:09.840
we'll discuss in a little bit more detail,

04:08:09.840 --> 04:08:13.760
but it is our goal that we are able to reach areas

04:08:13.760 --> 04:08:16.920
across the state where there are high levels

04:08:16.920 --> 04:08:21.920
of qualification and to date, lower levels of participation.

04:08:22.120 --> 04:08:23.320
And next slide, please.

04:08:26.440 --> 04:08:29.280
This is what I spoke about in terms

04:08:29.280 --> 04:08:31.360
of the interim technical assistance plan.

04:08:33.080 --> 04:08:35.520
Very important to us to ensure

04:08:35.520 --> 04:08:40.400
that as we are developing this program

04:08:40.400 --> 04:08:43.400
between this transformative assistance program

04:08:43.400 --> 04:08:46.280
that Dr. Prowall discussed

04:08:46.280 --> 04:08:49.960
and Dr. Hawthorne of course elaborated on,

04:08:49.960 --> 04:08:54.200
that there is a robust interim technical assistance plan

04:08:54.200 --> 04:08:55.880
for this cohort.

04:08:55.880 --> 04:08:59.760
To date that has consisted of three elements.

04:08:59.760 --> 04:09:02.960
One is webinars that have been held by weekly,

04:09:02.960 --> 04:09:05.240
co-hosted by ourselves

04:09:05.240 --> 04:09:09.360
and the Alameda County Office of Education.

04:09:09.360 --> 04:09:11.600
They've been very well attended.

04:09:11.600 --> 04:09:14.560
And I've noted in the webinars,

04:09:14.560 --> 04:09:19.560
usually it's 400, 500, even more than 500 participants

04:09:20.680 --> 04:09:22.560
in these webinars.

04:09:22.560 --> 04:09:27.080
We've established a call center and email box system

04:09:27.080 --> 04:09:32.080
between ourselves and ACOE.

04:09:33.400 --> 04:09:37.520
We will be, as we extend our contract with West Ed,

04:09:37.520 --> 04:09:40.720
West Ed will provide additional bandwidth for us

04:09:40.720 --> 04:09:43.920
on both the call center and this email box.

04:09:43.920 --> 04:09:48.320
We meet weekly together as a team,

04:09:48.360 --> 04:09:52.120
both Alameda County and ourselves as a CDE team

04:09:52.120 --> 04:09:55.600
to calibrate our RTA responses.

04:09:55.600 --> 04:09:57.200
And to tell you the truth,

04:09:57.200 --> 04:10:00.520
we're in constant contact in between

04:10:00.520 --> 04:10:03.080
those calibration meetings to ensure

04:10:03.080 --> 04:10:06.280
that we are getting both accurate,

04:10:06.280 --> 04:10:11.280
but also to our cohort one

04:10:13.160 --> 04:10:16.160
planning and implementation grantees who are reaching out.

04:10:16.160 --> 04:10:18.360
And then the last element that we are bringing together

04:10:18.360 --> 04:10:22.480
now in anticipation for some more detailed questions.

04:10:22.480 --> 04:10:27.480
And particularly as the implementation grant is released,

04:10:29.560 --> 04:10:33.160
we're working on interdisciplinary guidance teams,

04:10:33.160 --> 04:10:38.160
meaning not only interdisciplinary CDE, ACOE and West Ed,

04:10:38.800 --> 04:10:42.120
but interdisciplinary in terms of the expertise

04:10:42.120 --> 04:10:44.280
that we're bringing into these teams

04:10:44.320 --> 04:10:47.760
from each of our respective agencies.

04:10:47.760 --> 04:10:49.720
What we hope is that we bring a team together

04:10:49.720 --> 04:10:52.360
based on the question or concern

04:10:52.360 --> 04:10:55.040
that's happening with the cohort one grantee.

04:10:55.040 --> 04:10:59.240
And we're able through that interdisciplinary process

04:10:59.240 --> 04:11:03.320
to get them all the assistance that they need

04:11:03.320 --> 04:11:07.120
to reach their implementation goals.

04:11:07.120 --> 04:11:10.960
I'm gonna hand it to Pete for the next slide.

04:11:10.960 --> 04:11:12.480
Thanks, Steve.

04:11:12.480 --> 04:11:15.320
So as noted in a previous slide,

04:11:15.320 --> 04:11:19.280
the legislature allocated up to $140 million

04:11:19.280 --> 04:11:21.120
for county offices of education

04:11:21.120 --> 04:11:23.600
to receive coordination grants.

04:11:23.600 --> 04:11:26.360
And those were county offices serving at least

04:11:26.360 --> 04:11:28.320
two qualifying entities

04:11:28.320 --> 04:11:30.720
that are receiving a community schools grant,

04:11:30.720 --> 04:11:34.680
whether it's a planning grant or an implementation grant.

04:11:34.680 --> 04:11:37.160
County offices of education will assist grantees

04:11:37.160 --> 04:11:39.880
with coordinating county level governmental

04:11:39.880 --> 04:11:42.680
nonprofit community-based organizations

04:11:42.680 --> 04:11:44.920
and other external partnerships

04:11:44.920 --> 04:11:49.920
to support the implementation of their CCSPP grants.

04:11:50.120 --> 04:11:53.320
County offices will have a community schools liaison

04:11:53.320 --> 04:11:55.200
to coordinate with CDE

04:11:55.200 --> 04:11:59.320
and the respective regional technical assistance centers.

04:11:59.320 --> 04:12:02.320
The county office of education coordination grant awards

04:12:02.320 --> 04:12:05.640
are based on the number of community schools funded

04:12:05.640 --> 04:12:07.560
in the county and the number of students

04:12:07.560 --> 04:12:09.480
enrolled at those schools.

04:12:09.480 --> 04:12:14.480
The allocations will be between 200,000 and 500,000 annually.

04:12:14.560 --> 04:12:16.720
Additional allocations will happen

04:12:16.720 --> 04:12:20.280
after cohort two planning and implementation grantees

04:12:20.280 --> 04:12:21.360
are determined.

04:12:24.240 --> 04:12:27.440
So on the coordination grant model,

04:12:27.440 --> 04:12:28.880
we built the allocation model

04:12:28.880 --> 04:12:31.480
based on the spread of enrollment at school sites

04:12:31.480 --> 04:12:34.800
and the spread of school sites within each county.

04:12:34.800 --> 04:12:37.040
In the future, we'll need to revisit this

04:12:37.040 --> 04:12:40.680
based on how many additional county offices of educations

04:12:40.680 --> 04:12:42.320
will come online with their additional

04:12:42.320 --> 04:12:45.200
community school grantees within their county.

04:12:45.200 --> 04:12:49.840
So the initial allocations that will be going out

04:12:49.840 --> 04:12:53.280
were based on this model that we put together.

04:12:54.200 --> 04:12:55.560
It could change in the future,

04:12:55.560 --> 04:12:58.840
just depending on how many county offices come on

04:12:58.840 --> 04:13:00.880
and their enrollments and the number of schools

04:13:00.880 --> 04:13:01.880
within their county.

04:13:01.880 --> 04:13:06.880
Okay, Brooklyn, I'll pass this over to Brooklyn Williams.

04:13:11.640 --> 04:13:13.480
All right, thank you so much.

04:13:13.480 --> 04:13:15.640
Pete, good afternoon, board members and community.

04:13:15.640 --> 04:13:17.320
As stated, my name is Brooklyn Williams

04:13:17.320 --> 04:13:20.960
and I serve as senior advisor to Superintendent Thurman.

04:13:20.960 --> 04:13:23.080
It has been an honor to be a part of the team

04:13:23.080 --> 04:13:24.920
supporting the California Community Schools

04:13:24.920 --> 04:13:26.320
Partnership Program.

04:13:26.320 --> 04:13:28.240
And I'm very happy to be with you all this afternoon

04:13:28.240 --> 04:13:30.840
to review grant making information.

04:13:30.840 --> 04:13:33.360
As you can see, the RFA for round two

04:13:33.360 --> 04:13:35.440
of the planning grant was released yesterday

04:13:35.440 --> 04:13:37.960
with the plan of the State Board of Education

04:13:37.960 --> 04:13:41.400
approving grantees in March of 2023,

04:13:41.400 --> 04:13:43.680
and the funding released in the winter of 22

04:13:43.680 --> 04:13:45.800
and the spring of 23.

04:13:45.800 --> 04:13:48.600
The RFA for round two for the implementation grants

04:13:48.600 --> 04:13:51.960
will be released January 23rd of next year

04:13:51.960 --> 04:13:54.440
with State Board approval in May

04:13:54.440 --> 04:13:57.960
and those funds going out in the spring of 23.

04:13:58.240 --> 04:14:01.640
Our outreach plan is both top down and ground up.

04:14:01.640 --> 04:14:04.360
CDE will host a series of webinars

04:14:04.360 --> 04:14:07.600
on Monday, November 7th and Wednesday, November 9th,

04:14:07.600 --> 04:14:11.000
as well as an early childhood education specific webinar

04:14:11.000 --> 04:14:15.680
on November 14th and another general webinar on December 6th.

04:14:15.680 --> 04:14:17.680
We are engaging with our community partners

04:14:17.680 --> 04:14:20.440
to support with outreach on the ground

04:14:20.440 --> 04:14:23.240
to help increase interest from families, communities

04:14:23.240 --> 04:14:25.760
and local districts and also awareness

04:14:25.760 --> 04:14:27.640
of the webinars CDE will be hosting.

04:14:28.840 --> 04:14:30.440
And with that, I will turn it back

04:14:30.440 --> 04:14:32.120
to Deputy Superintendent Zimmer.

04:14:32.960 --> 04:14:34.520
Thank you so much, Brooklyn.

04:14:35.560 --> 04:14:38.480
The final piece of the implementation plan

04:14:38.480 --> 04:14:41.440
involves the formative evaluation.

04:14:41.440 --> 04:14:45.560
And this is also an RFA that we will be releasing

04:14:45.560 --> 04:14:50.560
in January and as community schools is transformative.

04:14:51.280 --> 04:14:53.680
We are taking great care

04:14:53.680 --> 04:14:56.280
and the legislature is taking great care.

04:14:56.280 --> 04:14:58.440
I know the Board has taken great care

04:14:58.440 --> 04:15:03.440
in ensuring that our evaluation process

04:15:04.760 --> 04:15:06.920
reflects the transformative nature

04:15:06.920 --> 04:15:11.920
of what we need, of the ambition and the goal of CCSPP.

04:15:13.800 --> 04:15:17.200
So we will look at outcome data,

04:15:17.320 --> 04:15:20.320
including measurements of student wellbeing, engagement,

04:15:20.320 --> 04:15:25.320
and including but not limited to measures of attendance,

04:15:26.480 --> 04:15:28.840
but also ways to measure school climate.

04:15:28.840 --> 04:15:30.880
Analysis of the services being provided

04:15:30.880 --> 04:15:33.360
and changes that are taking place in schools,

04:15:33.360 --> 04:15:36.720
areas of progress and challenges to be addressed,

04:15:36.720 --> 04:15:40.320
to meet the goals of the CCSPP framework,

04:15:40.320 --> 04:15:44.320
including but not limited to the quality of education,

04:15:44.320 --> 04:15:46.800
the framework, including but not limited

04:15:46.800 --> 04:15:51.080
to the effective integration of instructional

04:15:51.080 --> 04:15:52.920
and student support services,

04:15:52.920 --> 04:15:56.360
support for authentic student and educator

04:15:56.360 --> 04:15:57.720
and family engagement,

04:15:57.720 --> 04:16:00.040
or also looking for evidence and best practices

04:16:00.040 --> 04:16:01.640
and successful strategies

04:16:01.640 --> 04:16:04.240
for integrating multiple funding systems

04:16:04.240 --> 04:16:09.240
to meet the LEA's school improvement goals

04:16:10.760 --> 04:16:13.120
identified in their outcome.

04:16:13.120 --> 04:16:16.440
The first date for a formative assessment

04:16:16.440 --> 04:16:18.560
and annual formative assessment

04:16:18.560 --> 04:16:21.920
will be the end of the next calendar year, December 31st.

04:16:21.920 --> 04:16:22.760
And that once you know,

04:16:22.760 --> 04:16:25.320
this is a conversation that we've begun to engage

04:16:25.320 --> 04:16:30.320
with the STAP and several of our university

04:16:30.440 --> 04:16:33.240
and top partners on this.

04:16:33.240 --> 04:16:37.400
We look forward to reporting back to the Board

04:16:37.400 --> 04:16:41.800
about our progress in this area.

04:16:41.800 --> 04:16:45.200
And I've promised to get to our final slide

04:16:45.200 --> 04:16:50.200
where I just wanna go over what we are looking

04:16:51.480 --> 04:16:52.520
on the Board today.

04:16:54.040 --> 04:16:58.720
First, the approval of the selection and recommendation

04:16:58.720 --> 04:17:01.560
of the regional technical assistance centers.

04:17:01.560 --> 04:17:03.800
And then I'll read to you directly

04:17:03.800 --> 04:17:05.400
what we're asking for in terms

04:17:05.400 --> 04:17:08.320
of our updated administrative plan.

04:17:08.320 --> 04:17:09.840
We're asking the Board's approval

04:17:09.880 --> 04:17:12.000
of the updated administrative plan.

04:17:12.000 --> 04:17:15.360
We are also asking to delegate CDE in consultation

04:17:15.360 --> 04:17:18.560
with and subject to the approval of the Executive Director

04:17:18.560 --> 04:17:20.320
of the State Board of Education

04:17:20.320 --> 04:17:22.960
on our ability to build a final list

04:17:22.960 --> 04:17:27.120
of the 2022-23 County Office of a Coronation Grant

04:17:27.120 --> 04:17:31.040
allocations consistent with this administrative plan.

04:17:31.040 --> 04:17:34.200
These awards shall be posted for public review and comment

04:17:34.200 --> 04:17:35.960
filed to the posting of a final list.

04:17:36.000 --> 04:17:39.000
The final list shall be posted on November 18th.

04:17:40.320 --> 04:17:44.880
I would just say we had an unexpected technical problem

04:17:44.880 --> 04:17:48.880
with our data set that may have caused a few errors

04:17:48.880 --> 04:17:52.160
both in allocation amounts and determining

04:17:53.400 --> 04:17:58.400
whether a COE had the necessary two grantee threshold.

04:17:59.240 --> 04:18:04.240
We believe that we can reconcile this with this delegation

04:18:05.920 --> 04:18:09.920
reporting in collaboration with our partners.

04:18:09.920 --> 04:18:14.920
And I'll just wrap by saying that I appreciate,

04:18:16.200 --> 04:18:19.040
and I know the Superintendent appreciates

04:18:19.040 --> 04:18:24.040
the just incredible collaboration in this department.

04:18:24.080 --> 04:18:28.280
I appreciate the just incredible collaboration,

04:18:28.280 --> 04:18:31.440
the incredible work first of Pete Callis,

04:18:32.720 --> 04:18:35.800
Lisa Reimers, Brooklyn Williams,

04:18:35.800 --> 04:18:39.480
and Deanna Niebuhr, whose term of service with us has ended

04:18:39.480 --> 04:18:42.720
but was a great contributor to this process.

04:18:42.720 --> 04:18:47.280
But also our collaboration with State Board of Ed staff,

04:18:47.280 --> 04:18:51.480
particularly Roger Osarro and Jessica Haltz

04:18:51.520 --> 04:18:55.520
who have been our partners on this

04:18:55.520 --> 04:18:57.160
in every step of the way.

04:18:57.160 --> 04:19:00.240
It truly has been a collaborative spirit

04:19:00.240 --> 04:19:05.240
to which we work on this that is extended to the ARTAC

04:19:05.400 --> 04:19:10.080
and very competent will extend to our work with the ARTAC.

04:19:10.080 --> 04:19:12.680
And if the work of the Anaheim Union

04:19:12.680 --> 04:19:16.720
and the schools we've been able to see to date

04:19:16.720 --> 04:19:18.200
is an indicator,

04:19:18.200 --> 04:19:23.200
the investment that has been made by this board

04:19:24.000 --> 04:19:26.320
by our government in the future,

04:19:26.320 --> 04:19:29.440
we truly do have a chance

04:19:29.440 --> 04:19:34.000
with the California Community Schools Partnership Program

04:19:34.000 --> 04:19:38.640
to support other schools.

04:19:38.640 --> 04:19:40.000
Superintendent's vision, I know,

04:19:40.000 --> 04:19:42.520
President Darling-Hammond's vision as well.

04:19:42.520 --> 04:19:44.800
So thank you for the opportunity to present today

04:19:44.800 --> 04:19:47.640
and welcome your questions.

04:19:48.680 --> 04:19:49.640
Thank you so much.

04:19:49.640 --> 04:19:52.240
That was a very rich presentation.

04:19:52.240 --> 04:19:56.360
I know people have a lot of comments and questions.

04:19:56.360 --> 04:20:00.240
We do want to open the public comment line.

04:20:00.240 --> 04:20:01.600
And so if we could put the public,

04:20:01.600 --> 04:20:03.760
there it is, the public comment slide.

04:20:03.760 --> 04:20:06.280
Members of the public wishing to provide comment

04:20:06.280 --> 04:20:08.840
on this item may do so by calling the telephone number

04:20:08.840 --> 04:20:11.040
and using the access code provided

04:20:11.040 --> 04:20:13.000
on the slide that is shown now.

04:20:13.000 --> 04:20:16.040
While we're waiting, I'm gonna ask our liaison member,

04:20:16.080 --> 04:20:19.200
Escobedo, if he has any initial comments.

04:20:19.200 --> 04:20:22.240
And then if there are clarifying questions from the board

04:20:22.240 --> 04:20:24.480
for any of the people who've presented,

04:20:24.480 --> 04:20:26.200
we can take those.

04:20:26.200 --> 04:20:27.560
Then we'll take public comments,

04:20:27.560 --> 04:20:30.320
then we'll come back for a full board discussion.

04:20:30.320 --> 04:20:33.680
So that's kind of the order of operations.

04:20:33.680 --> 04:20:35.560
From here, Member Escobedo.

04:20:37.120 --> 04:20:38.960
Thank you, Dr. Hammond.

04:20:39.960 --> 04:20:43.320
I truly believe that every system is perfectly designed

04:20:43.320 --> 04:20:45.800
to achieve the results it gets

04:20:46.560 --> 04:20:51.560
and I also know that the system that is being created

04:20:52.360 --> 04:20:56.840
and we're voting on with these regional techs

04:20:56.840 --> 04:21:00.480
and how they're gonna support districts and schools

04:21:00.480 --> 04:21:03.840
at a local level is really crucial.

04:21:03.840 --> 04:21:08.840
And I look forward to seeing those results

04:21:09.680 --> 04:21:12.240
and hearing what those outcomes are.

04:21:12.240 --> 04:21:15.760
And I'm really grateful that we will be hiring

04:21:16.720 --> 04:21:17.560
an entity to do that.

04:21:17.560 --> 04:21:21.760
And so this really is a start of creating this system,

04:21:23.200 --> 04:21:27.520
the system that can, that has a great potential

04:21:27.520 --> 04:21:31.920
to transform our great state of California

04:21:31.920 --> 04:21:34.280
and transform teaching and learning

04:21:34.280 --> 04:21:39.000
at a significant number of school sites

04:21:39.000 --> 04:21:40.040
throughout our state.

04:21:41.520 --> 04:21:43.680
Yes, I would just add to that.

04:21:44.480 --> 04:21:48.120
I have the opportunity to hear about what folks are doing

04:21:48.120 --> 04:21:51.320
between the board meetings who are involved

04:21:51.320 --> 04:21:53.560
with both the technical assistance functions,

04:21:53.560 --> 04:21:55.240
the work at the department

04:21:55.240 --> 04:21:59.440
and those in the community school grantees themselves.

04:21:59.440 --> 04:22:03.680
And it is quite inspiring to see the level of engagement,

04:22:03.680 --> 04:22:08.200
the level of thinking, the transformational frame

04:22:08.200 --> 04:22:10.920
that is being brought to the work.

04:22:10.920 --> 04:22:15.040
So we know that this is an enormous lift

04:22:15.040 --> 04:22:17.520
at a time when people are already very stretched

04:22:17.520 --> 04:22:21.960
in the state, but we appreciate all of the effort going in

04:22:21.960 --> 04:22:26.600
and the good signals that are already apparent

04:22:26.600 --> 04:22:28.320
in so many communities.

04:22:28.320 --> 04:22:30.880
And especially appreciate the work of the staff

04:22:30.880 --> 04:22:34.720
that has been nonstop and intense

04:22:34.720 --> 04:22:37.240
ever since this process got going.

04:22:38.400 --> 04:22:40.200
We have clarifying questions now.

04:22:40.200 --> 04:22:42.760
So I'm gonna ask folks to keep their questions

04:22:42.760 --> 04:22:45.440
to clarifying types of questions.

04:22:45.440 --> 04:22:47.840
And then when you wanna dig in on the discussion,

04:22:47.840 --> 04:22:50.080
we'll come back to that after public comment.

04:22:50.080 --> 04:22:53.720
Vice President Glover-Woods, you can kick us off.

04:22:53.720 --> 04:22:55.560
Thank you, and I'm quite excited to engage

04:22:55.560 --> 04:22:58.040
in our discussion after a public comment.

04:22:58.040 --> 04:23:00.000
This is, again, quite exciting.

04:23:00.000 --> 04:23:03.280
My clarifying question is in regards to the RTATs

04:23:03.280 --> 04:23:06.080
that were listed in the board item.

04:23:06.080 --> 04:23:09.480
I noticed that Monterey County Office of Education

04:23:09.480 --> 04:23:12.640
did not have any formal partners listed.

04:23:12.640 --> 04:23:14.920
I just wanted to know who their partners are.

04:23:17.280 --> 04:23:20.440
Yeah, thank you, Board Member Glover-Woods

04:23:20.440 --> 04:23:22.120
for elevating that.

04:23:22.120 --> 04:23:27.120
We met with Monterey County to discuss that very issue

04:23:29.360 --> 04:23:31.320
prior to our recommendation.

04:23:34.080 --> 04:23:37.800
They had not formed formal partnerships

04:23:37.800 --> 04:23:40.240
prior to their application.

04:23:41.120 --> 04:23:44.320
But we were able to, in the discussion with them,

04:23:45.640 --> 04:23:48.400
just they extensively listed the partners

04:23:48.400 --> 04:23:51.720
that they were working with.

04:23:51.720 --> 04:23:53.920
And it really was a kind of,

04:23:56.320 --> 04:23:57.560
well, I won't say misunderstanding,

04:23:57.560 --> 04:24:00.720
but it was how they interpreted the question

04:24:00.720 --> 04:24:04.040
in the application that led them

04:24:04.040 --> 04:24:07.480
to not formally list the partners.

04:24:08.160 --> 04:24:11.160
And I can get you a list of their partners,

04:24:11.160 --> 04:24:14.200
but they did include CBOs.

04:24:14.200 --> 04:24:17.320
They did include other components

04:24:17.320 --> 04:24:20.560
on the county support system,

04:24:20.560 --> 04:24:22.880
as well as other county offices of education

04:24:22.880 --> 04:24:24.640
in their region.

04:24:24.640 --> 04:24:28.280
So we left them very reassured.

04:24:28.280 --> 04:24:31.360
We're just kind of governed by the confines

04:24:32.320 --> 04:24:35.480
of how to kind of legally list this.

04:24:35.520 --> 04:24:38.360
It wasn't in their application

04:24:38.360 --> 04:24:40.120
in the same way it was in others.

04:24:40.120 --> 04:24:41.480
And so we did have that meeting.

04:24:41.480 --> 04:24:42.320
I want to share with the board.

04:24:42.320 --> 04:24:44.640
We did have that meeting to clarify

04:24:44.640 --> 04:24:47.440
and left that meeting very reassured

04:24:47.440 --> 04:24:50.320
of the partnerships that they have on the ground.

04:24:50.320 --> 04:24:51.160
Thank you.

04:24:51.160 --> 04:24:51.980
Thank you for the question.

04:24:51.980 --> 04:24:53.080
Thank you.

04:24:53.080 --> 04:24:54.480
Appreciate that.

04:24:54.480 --> 04:24:55.320
Member McQuillan.

04:24:56.520 --> 04:24:57.560
Yes, thank you.

04:24:57.560 --> 04:25:00.320
Thank you for these presentations.

04:25:00.320 --> 04:25:02.320
Also very exciting,

04:25:02.320 --> 04:25:05.520
the rollout of the community schools.

04:25:05.520 --> 04:25:08.520
Question of clarification on the TA centers.

04:25:09.680 --> 04:25:12.600
Will each, I see Shasta County,

04:25:12.600 --> 04:25:16.600
maybe the rural connection.

04:25:16.600 --> 04:25:20.680
Will each of those centers have like model programs

04:25:20.680 --> 04:25:22.440
or schools that others can say,

04:25:22.440 --> 04:25:24.240
hey, this is working here.

04:25:24.240 --> 04:25:27.880
Come look at this model.

04:25:27.880 --> 04:25:29.240
Thank you.

04:25:29.240 --> 04:25:31.640
Yeah, that is absolutely the intent.

04:25:32.640 --> 04:25:37.400
Both from the regional TAC,

04:25:37.400 --> 04:25:42.400
but also as Dr. Quartz outlined, very intentional.

04:25:43.280 --> 04:25:44.760
We've been involved in these conversations

04:25:44.760 --> 04:25:46.760
with the S-TAC as well,

04:25:46.760 --> 04:25:48.680
creating these models,

04:25:48.680 --> 04:25:52.080
creating opportunities for virtual visits

04:25:52.080 --> 04:25:53.800
and actual visits.

04:25:53.800 --> 04:25:57.280
I know that the S-TAC will be,

04:25:57.280 --> 04:26:00.800
and I want to take Dr. Perot's thunder,

04:26:01.280 --> 04:26:06.280
I know the S-TAC will be taking a tour, so to speak,

04:26:08.560 --> 04:26:11.440
after this approval process

04:26:11.440 --> 04:26:15.400
of making sure that they are learning on the ground

04:26:16.920 --> 04:26:20.680
what are the models in the different regions

04:26:20.680 --> 04:26:22.240
and different areas of our state.

04:26:22.240 --> 04:26:25.520
So board member, that is exactly the intention.

04:26:25.520 --> 04:26:26.360
Thanks for that.

04:26:28.160 --> 04:26:29.480
Terrific.

04:26:29.480 --> 04:26:32.760
I'm not seeing any other hands for clarifying questions.

04:26:33.680 --> 04:26:38.160
So with that, I think we'll move to public comment.

04:26:38.160 --> 04:26:40.320
If there's any public comment for this item,

04:26:40.320 --> 04:26:43.040
we encourage people who are calling in

04:26:43.040 --> 04:26:45.320
to state your name and affiliation for the record

04:26:45.320 --> 04:26:48.160
and remember to turn down the speaker volume

04:26:48.160 --> 04:26:51.120
of your computer if you're following the live feed

04:26:51.120 --> 04:26:53.160
and speakers are limited to one minute each.

04:26:53.160 --> 04:26:55.280
Are there any public comments?

04:26:55.280 --> 04:26:58.040
Yes, we currently have 24 callers in the queue.

04:26:58.080 --> 04:26:59.640
I will open the phone line now.

04:27:00.880 --> 04:27:01.720
Good afternoon.

04:27:01.720 --> 04:27:03.480
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:27:10.960 --> 04:27:11.800
Good afternoon.

04:27:11.800 --> 04:27:13.360
Thank you, board president Darling-Hammond

04:27:13.360 --> 04:27:15.080
and members of the board.

04:27:15.080 --> 04:27:16.800
My name is Dante Soliano

04:27:16.800 --> 04:27:18.280
and I'm the executive director

04:27:18.280 --> 04:27:21.280
for the Sacramento County Office of Education.

04:27:21.280 --> 04:27:23.880
And on behalf of the Sacramento County Office of Education,

04:27:23.880 --> 04:27:27.920
I'm calling in to support item number four on the agenda.

04:27:27.920 --> 04:27:30.600
We greatly appreciate the California Department

04:27:30.600 --> 04:27:33.040
of Education's recommendation to select

04:27:33.040 --> 04:27:35.040
the Sacramento County Office of Education

04:27:35.040 --> 04:27:40.800
for the 2022-23 BCSPP Regional Technical

04:27:40.800 --> 04:27:42.520
Assistance Center RTAC Awards.

04:27:43.320 --> 04:27:46.080
We will be co-leading this effort with the Placer County

04:27:46.080 --> 04:27:48.200
Office of Education to support the region.

04:27:48.800 --> 04:27:50.560
So we eagerly await the opportunity

04:27:50.560 --> 04:27:53.320
to continue the work that we are supporting for.

04:27:53.320 --> 04:27:55.000
We're supporting for community schools

04:27:55.000 --> 04:27:57.840
and in serving students families and districts

04:27:57.840 --> 04:27:59.840
as a leader in this space.

04:27:59.840 --> 04:28:01.800
So we're grateful for the time and effort

04:28:01.800 --> 04:28:03.800
put into the development of this program

04:28:03.800 --> 04:28:05.920
by the CDE State Board of Education

04:28:05.920 --> 04:28:09.560
and the State Transformative Assistance Center.

04:28:09.560 --> 04:28:12.160
We look forward to continuing to work with you

04:28:12.160 --> 04:28:17.160
all to ensure the success of the CCSPP.

04:28:17.200 --> 04:28:18.240
Thank you.

04:28:18.240 --> 04:28:19.080
Thank you.

Your time starts now.

04:28:28.240 --> 04:28:29.400
Good afternoon everyone.

04:28:29.400 --> 04:28:31.520
Thank you Board President Darling-Hammond,

04:28:31.520 --> 04:28:33.920
board members, colleagues and community members.

04:28:33.920 --> 04:28:36.200

04:28:41.600 --> 04:28:43.480
I am also here in support of Item 4.

04:28:44.160 --> 04:28:45.800
Our County Office of Education along

04:28:45.800 --> 04:28:48.360

for our greater LA area.

04:28:58.320 --> 04:29:00.600
We are truly enthusiastic about the opportunities

04:29:00.600 --> 04:29:03.640
that CCSPP presents for the transformation

04:29:03.640 --> 04:29:06.040
of LA County Schools to break the cycle

04:29:06.040 --> 04:29:08.600
of childhood poverty and realize the promise

04:29:08.600 --> 04:29:10.800
and potential of our public educational system

04:29:11.320 --> 04:29:13.040
especially and particularly for our

04:29:13.040 --> 04:29:15.280
historically underserved children and communities.

04:29:15.960 --> 04:29:17.840
We are deeply and unwaveringly committed

04:29:17.840 --> 04:29:20.000
to partnering championing and accelerating

04:29:20.000 --> 04:29:22.720
the success of CCSPP in alignment

04:29:22.720 --> 04:29:24.800
with the other historic state and regional

04:29:24.800 --> 04:29:27.440
initiatives and investments in support

04:29:27.440 --> 04:29:30.280
of all children youth families educators

04:29:30.280 --> 04:29:31.280
and communities.

04:29:31.680 --> 04:29:33.840
Many of these initiatives have been highlighted today.

04:29:34.640 --> 04:29:36.600
And with that I'd like to thank you for your leadership

04:29:36.600 --> 04:29:38.360
and for the opportunity to serve.

04:29:38.360 --> 04:29:39.360
Thank you. Thank you.

You have one minute. Your time starts now.

04:29:50.160 --> 04:29:51.160
Hello.

04:29:52.040 --> 04:29:53.040
Yes caller your life.

04:29:53.040 --> 04:29:54.040
Yes.

Please state your public comment.

04:29:56.080 --> 04:29:57.080
Hi.

04:29:58.320 --> 04:29:59.720
My name is Lorraine Richards.

04:29:59.720 --> 04:30:01.680
I am a classroom teacher representing

04:30:01.680 --> 04:30:03.480
California Teachers Association.

04:30:03.480 --> 04:30:06.760
CTA is pleased with the work that the S-TAC

04:30:06.760 --> 04:30:09.320
and we believe that all the support provided

04:30:09.320 --> 04:30:12.520
by the newly awarded R-TAC must be driven

04:30:12.520 --> 04:30:16.200
by the S-TAC to ensure that the support is consistent

04:30:16.200 --> 04:30:17.600
and grounded in the framework.

04:30:18.120 --> 04:30:20.560
Additionally we look forward to working with the CDE

04:30:20.560 --> 04:30:23.120
to help ensure that grantees are truly

04:30:23.120 --> 04:30:24.320
committed to the framework.

04:30:24.680 --> 04:30:27.560
It's four pillars and the four cornerstone commitment.

04:30:28.240 --> 04:30:31.200
We believe that grantees in round two must be held

04:30:31.200 --> 04:30:33.720
to a higher standard of implementation

04:30:33.720 --> 04:30:35.720
to transition from a planning grant

04:30:35.720 --> 04:30:39.240
to an implementation grant as well as for implementation

04:30:39.240 --> 04:30:42.000
grant recipients to receive year two funding.

04:30:42.000 --> 04:30:44.760
All the great work occurring at the state level

04:30:44.760 --> 04:30:47.120
to provide these transformational opportunities

04:30:47.120 --> 04:30:49.840
for our students educators and communities

04:30:49.840 --> 04:30:52.800
will be compromised if we allow substandard

04:30:52.840 --> 04:30:55.280
implementation at the local level. Thank you.

04:30:55.280 --> 04:30:56.520
Thank you.

04:30:56.520 --> 04:30:57.680

Good afternoon members of the board.

04:31:18.480 --> 04:31:19.600
My name is Eric Yanez.

04:31:19.600 --> 04:31:21.600

with the California Partnership.

04:31:27.080 --> 04:31:28.920
Thank you for today's presentation.

04:31:28.920 --> 04:31:31.960
We appreciate the various layers of assistance

04:31:31.960 --> 04:31:33.600
for community schools implementation

04:31:33.600 --> 04:31:36.200
and we want to make sure all levels are aligned

04:31:36.200 --> 04:31:37.720
with the community schools framework

04:31:37.720 --> 04:31:40.000
and have support to be effective and transformative.

04:31:40.000 --> 04:31:43.440
For the 42 county offices of education receiving

04:31:43.440 --> 04:31:48.000
coordination grants totaling in 140 million over seven years

04:31:48.000 --> 04:31:51.000
the current plan does not make clear how they will be

04:31:51.040 --> 04:31:52.600
supportive and assisting planning

04:31:52.600 --> 04:31:54.200
and implementation grantees.

04:31:54.200 --> 04:31:56.680
We seek clarification around what capacity

04:31:56.680 --> 04:32:00.800
building support will be provided by and to these

04:32:00.800 --> 04:32:03.560
county offices of education to ensure they are effective

04:32:03.560 --> 04:32:05.440
including having county-level community

04:32:05.440 --> 04:32:08.720
schools liaison participate in S-PAC or R-TAC

04:32:08.720 --> 04:32:11.120
communities of practices to establish alignment

04:32:11.120 --> 04:32:13.560
with transformative vision of racially just

04:32:13.560 --> 04:32:15.120
relationship centered community schools.

04:32:15.120 --> 04:32:16.440
I want to leave you with this.

04:32:16.440 --> 04:32:19.160
Transformation can only happen when students families

04:32:19.200 --> 04:32:21.200
communities and educators and directive leaders

04:32:21.200 --> 04:32:22.400
are authentic partners.

04:32:22.400 --> 04:32:23.240
Thank you.

04:32:23.240 --> 04:32:24.080
Thank you.

04:32:24.080 --> 04:32:25.280
Next caller please state your name

04:32:25.280 --> 04:32:27.000
and affiliation for the record you have one minute.

04:32:27.000 --> 04:32:28.160
Your time starts now.

04:32:32.880 --> 04:32:34.480
Good afternoon President Darling-Hammond

04:32:34.480 --> 04:32:36.040
and esteemed state board trustees.

04:32:36.040 --> 04:32:38.120
My name is Francisco Ortiz and I have the privilege

04:32:38.120 --> 04:32:40.320
of being a homegrown teacher in West Contra Costa

04:32:40.320 --> 04:32:41.720
Unified School District.

04:32:41.720 --> 04:32:43.440
I'm also the community schools organizer

04:32:43.440 --> 04:32:45.720
and vice president of the United Teachers of Richmond.

04:32:45.720 --> 04:32:48.440
On behalf of the 1600 educators we will present

04:32:48.480 --> 04:32:50.760
the UTR is excited and grateful that the CDE

04:32:50.760 --> 04:32:52.640
is moving forward with the approval of regional

04:32:52.640 --> 04:32:55.360
technical assistance centers to support our efforts

04:32:55.360 --> 04:32:57.600
to strengthen and expand our community schools program

04:32:57.600 --> 04:33:00.280
in West Contra Costa which received the fifth largest

04:33:00.280 --> 04:33:01.640
implementation grant in the state.

04:33:02.200 --> 04:33:04.440
We hope that through these regional supports LEAs

04:33:04.440 --> 04:33:06.560
will strengthen efforts that center and reinforce

04:33:06.560 --> 04:33:09.320
the transformative power of shared leadership practices.

04:33:09.320 --> 04:33:11.560
We know that this pillar built on trust

04:33:11.560 --> 04:33:13.480
is a relational glue that holds the community

04:33:13.480 --> 04:33:16.200
school strategies together while positively

04:33:16.240 --> 04:33:19.040
impacting academic improvement and student learning.

04:33:19.040 --> 04:33:21.800
Transformation can only happen when students families

04:33:21.800 --> 04:33:23.720
educators district leaders and communities

04:33:23.720 --> 04:33:25.120
are authentic partners.

04:33:25.120 --> 04:33:27.400
Remember that nothing about us without us.

04:33:27.400 --> 04:33:28.400
Thank you.

04:33:28.400 --> 04:33:29.360
Thank you.

04:33:29.360 --> 04:33:31.160
Next caller please state your name and affiliation

04:33:32.280 --> 04:33:33.280
Your time starts now.

04:33:38.400 --> 04:33:39.680
Thank you. My name is Amanda Dickey.

04:33:39.680 --> 04:33:42.200
I'm the executive director of government relations

04:33:42.200 --> 04:33:44.200
for the Santa Clara County Office of Education

04:33:44.200 --> 04:33:45.840
and I'm here today on behalf of Dr.

04:33:45.840 --> 04:33:48.440
DeJuan the Santa Clara County Superintendent.

04:33:48.440 --> 04:33:51.280
We are very pleased that CDE has recommended

04:33:51.280 --> 04:33:53.400
the Santa Clara County Office of Education

04:33:53.400 --> 04:33:56.440
to serve as the Bay Area ARTAC and we look forward

04:33:56.440 --> 04:34:00.040
to bringing our expertise that our staff has acquired

04:34:00.040 --> 04:34:02.560
as an operator and a TA provider of community

04:34:02.560 --> 04:34:04.600
schools in our county for the last several years.

04:34:05.120 --> 04:34:07.200
We also are really looking forward to bringing together

04:34:07.200 --> 04:34:09.600
the county office community school liaisons

04:34:09.600 --> 04:34:12.680
to ensure that the role of the liaisons for all

04:34:12.720 --> 04:34:14.760
counties honors the legislative intent

04:34:14.760 --> 04:34:16.920
and aligns with the state's adopted community

04:34:16.920 --> 04:34:18.400
school pillars. Thank you.

04:34:18.400 --> 04:34:19.400
Thank you.

04:34:19.400 --> 04:34:21.680

04:34:22.840 --> 04:34:23.840
Your time starts now.

04:34:27.360 --> 04:34:28.760
Good afternoon. My name is Dr.

04:34:28.760 --> 04:34:31.160
Annie Sharp and I am calling on behalf of the Fresno

04:34:31.160 --> 04:34:33.160
County Superintendent of Schools Jimmy Ovino

04:34:33.160 --> 04:34:35.160
to support item four on today's agenda.

04:34:35.160 --> 04:34:37.160
He is appreciative of the California Department

04:34:37.160 --> 04:34:39.680
of Education's recommendation to select our county

04:34:39.680 --> 04:34:43.880
Office of Education for one of the 2022-2023

04:34:43.880 --> 04:34:47.120
CCSPP Regional Technical Assistance Center awards.

04:34:47.680 --> 04:34:49.600
In partnership with Kern County Superintendent

04:34:49.600 --> 04:34:52.400
of Schools West Ed and Fresno Pacific University

04:34:52.400 --> 04:34:54.800
we are eager to continue the work that we are doing

04:34:54.800 --> 04:34:57.680
with community schools and serve as a leader in this space.

04:34:57.680 --> 04:35:00.120
We greatly appreciate the time and effort put

04:35:00.120 --> 04:35:02.960
into the development of this program by the CDE

04:35:02.960 --> 04:35:04.720
the State Board of Education and the State

04:35:04.720 --> 04:35:06.400
Transformational Assistance Center.

04:35:06.400 --> 04:35:08.640
And we look forward to continuing to work

04:35:08.680 --> 04:35:10.880
towards success for all students through

04:35:10.880 --> 04:35:13.000
the California Community Schools Partnership Program.

04:35:13.000 --> 04:35:14.000
Thank you.

04:35:14.000 --> 04:35:14.840
Thank you.

04:35:14.840 --> 04:35:16.040
Next caller please state your name

04:35:16.040 --> 04:35:17.240
and affiliation for the record.

04:35:17.240 --> 04:35:18.760
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

04:35:21.200 --> 04:35:23.560
I have a very hard stop at 245.

04:35:23.560 --> 04:35:25.840
I literally have to get my card out somewhere.

04:35:25.840 --> 04:35:26.440
Okay.

04:35:26.440 --> 04:35:27.440
I was even wondering.

04:35:28.040 --> 04:35:34.520
So if you know if that doesn't happen I'll take my eye out.

04:35:35.000 --> 04:35:35.720
Caller.

04:35:35.720 --> 04:35:39.320
Caller ending in the last four digits 7 0 8 3.

04:35:39.320 --> 04:35:40.280
You are now live.

04:35:40.280 --> 04:35:41.520
Please start your public comment.

04:35:46.400 --> 04:35:47.480
Hi. Good afternoon.

04:35:47.480 --> 04:35:47.960
Sorry.

04:35:47.960 --> 04:35:48.320
Dr.

04:35:48.320 --> 04:35:50.640
Hayen Kimner with the California Community Schools

04:35:50.640 --> 04:35:52.120
Learning Exchange.

04:35:52.120 --> 04:35:55.520
The goals of CSLX are to support systems transformation

04:35:55.520 --> 04:35:58.040
not random acts of whole child programming

04:35:58.040 --> 04:35:59.960
that often presents at the school level.

04:35:59.960 --> 04:36:02.240
It's critical that central office staffing

04:36:02.280 --> 04:36:04.160
and practices must model communicable

04:36:04.160 --> 04:36:06.080
priorities and integration strategies

04:36:06.080 --> 04:36:09.240
because just like schools this requires significant

04:36:09.240 --> 04:36:11.440
shifts in how they are structured and supported.

04:36:12.200 --> 04:36:14.880
We are especially concerned for implementation grantees

04:36:14.880 --> 04:36:17.720
ability to do so given the stipulation that LEAs

04:36:17.720 --> 04:36:20.640
may retain the lesser of five hundred thousand

04:36:20.640 --> 04:36:23.040
or 10 percent of grant funds to administer grants

04:36:23.040 --> 04:36:25.400
manage professional learning and coordinate services.

04:36:25.960 --> 04:36:29.000
For example the extreme Delta and capacity

04:36:29.000 --> 04:36:31.200
for change of a 30 million dollar grantee

04:36:31.240 --> 04:36:33.880
with 30 schools and five hundred thousand dollars

04:36:33.880 --> 04:36:35.360
versus three million.

04:36:35.360 --> 04:36:36.720
And whereas the state's investment

04:36:36.720 --> 04:36:38.560
and coordination grants at the county level

04:36:38.560 --> 04:36:41.080
reflects an understanding of necessary layers

04:36:41.080 --> 04:36:44.040
of systems change this cap for LEAs does not.

04:36:44.680 --> 04:36:47.960
The CCSPP funding is intended to provide infrastructure

04:36:47.960 --> 04:36:50.200
for alignment of the other state investments

04:36:50.200 --> 04:36:53.960
including CYBHI ELOP UTK among others.

04:36:53.960 --> 04:36:55.960
We encourage you to reconsider how such grant

04:36:55.960 --> 04:36:58.880
limitations impact the long term efficacy

04:36:58.880 --> 04:37:00.880
and sustainability of this strategy.

04:37:01.120 --> 04:37:02.080
Thank you so much.

04:37:02.080 --> 04:37:02.880
Thank you.

04:37:02.880 --> 04:37:04.240
Next caller please state your name

04:37:04.240 --> 04:37:05.440
and affiliation for the record.

04:37:05.440 --> 04:37:07.040
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

04:37:10.440 --> 04:37:11.160
Hello this is Dr.

04:37:11.160 --> 04:37:12.800
Kendra Fair with the California Community

04:37:12.800 --> 04:37:14.200
Schools Learning Exchange.

04:37:14.200 --> 04:37:16.240
We appreciate the detailed proposed timeline

04:37:16.240 --> 04:37:18.760
and CDA's continued commitment to a two year planning grant.

04:37:18.760 --> 04:37:21.160
The planning process is critical to meaningfully

04:37:21.160 --> 04:37:23.600
engaging students families and community partners

04:37:23.600 --> 04:37:25.640
building foundational knowledge generating buy-in

04:37:25.640 --> 04:37:27.360
and planning for long term sustainability

04:37:27.360 --> 04:37:28.760
of community schools.

04:37:28.800 --> 04:37:31.280
We're concerned that the cohort 4 implementation grant

04:37:31.280 --> 04:37:32.560
is flagged as potential.

04:37:33.160 --> 04:37:36.800
If this grant is not available for 25-26 an entire cohort

04:37:36.800 --> 04:37:38.440
of planning grantees will not have access

04:37:38.440 --> 04:37:40.480
to the full two years of the planning process.

04:37:41.200 --> 04:37:42.680
We flag this as an equity concern

04:37:42.680 --> 04:37:45.120
and also a concern with quality implementation.

04:37:45.120 --> 04:37:47.040
Limiting the planning period to one year

04:37:47.040 --> 04:37:49.200
risk limiting the critical relational work

04:37:49.200 --> 04:37:50.560
of engaging community stakeholders

04:37:50.560 --> 04:37:52.400
in shaping community school vision strategy

04:37:52.400 --> 04:37:53.440
and development.

04:37:53.440 --> 04:37:54.760
Commitment to share decision making

04:37:54.760 --> 04:37:56.600
and participatory practices is a cornerstone

04:37:56.600 --> 04:37:59.480
commitment of the CCSTP and shortening the planning

04:37:59.480 --> 04:38:02.360
period would negatively impact the grantee's ability

04:38:02.360 --> 04:38:03.440
to do this.

04:38:03.440 --> 04:38:05.840
Also initial CCSTP applicants tended

04:38:05.840 --> 04:38:09.160
to be from districts with higher capacities for grant writing.

04:38:09.160 --> 04:38:11.000
Many small rural and remote districts

04:38:11.000 --> 04:38:12.960
were left out despite serving some of the highest

04:38:12.960 --> 04:38:14.520
need students in the state.

04:38:14.520 --> 04:38:16.920
Applicants coming to CCSTP funding and later cohorts

04:38:16.920 --> 04:38:19.240
should be awarded the same quality planning opportunities

04:38:19.240 --> 04:38:20.320
as their earlier peers.

04:38:20.320 --> 04:38:22.760
Thank you so much for your continued support of this work.

04:38:22.760 --> 04:38:23.520

My name is Sue Gilford.

04:39:07.840 --> 04:39:09.600
I live in Orange Unified.

04:39:09.600 --> 04:39:14.360
My husband and I have lived in Orange Unified since 1976.

04:39:14.360 --> 04:39:17.480
Our sons graduated from the middle school

04:39:17.480 --> 04:39:19.000
and on the high school.

04:39:19.000 --> 04:39:19.840
I'm sorry, caller.

04:39:19.840 --> 04:39:22.040

Hi, my name is Sandy Davidson.

04:39:57.360 --> 04:40:00.480
And I'm motivated to speak today as a passionate

04:40:00.480 --> 04:40:05.960
about the issue on the change in the school district

04:40:05.960 --> 04:40:08.680
for panorama students.

04:40:08.680 --> 04:40:11.280
So all three of my children are panoramas students

04:40:11.280 --> 04:40:13.120
in San Diego.

04:40:13.120 --> 04:40:14.640

Please start your public comment.

04:40:49.840 --> 04:40:51.160
Good afternoon, members of the board.

04:40:51.160 --> 04:40:52.080
My name is Cole Harless.

04:40:52.120 --> 04:40:54.240
I am a field study intern with Healthy Contra Costa

04:40:54.240 --> 04:40:55.200
in Richmond.

04:40:55.200 --> 04:40:56.840
I'm a student advocate and much more.

04:40:56.840 --> 04:40:58.800
As a recently graduated high school student,

04:40:58.800 --> 04:41:00.440
it's very exciting to hear that the board is listening

04:41:00.440 --> 04:41:02.400
to feedback from the community as well as organizations

04:41:02.400 --> 04:41:03.400
on community schools.

04:41:03.400 --> 04:41:05.560
I'm calling in today to urge the department and board

04:41:05.560 --> 04:41:07.520
to be overly transparent with decision making

04:41:07.520 --> 04:41:09.000
as well as including the voices of shared

04:41:09.000 --> 04:41:10.000
decision making teams.

04:41:10.000 --> 04:41:12.320
It's important to note that these shared decision making

04:41:12.320 --> 04:41:14.360
teams should be made up directly of impacted

04:41:14.360 --> 04:41:15.600
students as well as their families.

04:41:15.600 --> 04:41:17.440
These shared decision making teams must include

04:41:17.440 --> 04:41:19.880
Black, Indigenous, and immigrant participants

04:41:19.880 --> 04:41:21.840
along with community partners and educators.

04:41:21.880 --> 04:41:24.160
From the perspective of a recently high school graduate,

04:41:24.160 --> 04:41:25.640
students, families, and community members

04:41:25.640 --> 04:41:27.640
should be supported as full and equal partners

04:41:27.640 --> 04:41:28.760
in discussion and decisions.

04:41:29.440 --> 04:41:31.600
If I could leave you with one important statement today,

04:41:31.600 --> 04:41:33.280
I would like you all to remember that transformation

04:41:33.280 --> 04:41:34.880
cannot happen without shared leadership

04:41:34.880 --> 04:41:36.720
and transparent communication. Thank you.

04:41:37.280 --> 04:41:38.320
Thank you.

04:41:38.320 --> 04:41:40.120
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

04:41:41.160 --> 04:41:42.160
Your time starts now.

04:41:45.760 --> 04:41:47.720
Good afternoon. My name is Aracely Simeon

04:41:47.720 --> 04:41:49.800
and I'm the executive director for the Parent

04:41:49.840 --> 04:41:51.680
Organization Network based in L.A.

04:41:52.240 --> 04:41:53.920
We are excited about the investment

04:41:53.920 --> 04:41:56.320
in the community schools program and its potential

04:41:56.320 --> 04:41:58.960
to transform the experience and outcomes for students.

04:41:59.600 --> 04:42:01.480
I am here today to urge the department,

04:42:01.480 --> 04:42:04.320
board, and the state TA center to consider

04:42:04.320 --> 04:42:07.000
the indicators for racially just relationship

04:42:07.000 --> 04:42:09.440
centered community schools in the implementation

04:42:09.440 --> 04:42:12.120
rubric in the annual formative assessment discussed

04:42:12.120 --> 04:42:13.240
in the administration plan.

04:42:13.960 --> 04:42:17.080
We want schools that not only better coordinate services

04:42:17.080 --> 04:42:19.920
but that actually build community between students

04:42:19.920 --> 04:42:21.400
families and staff.

04:42:21.400 --> 04:42:24.240
When adults are better able to partner to support students

04:42:24.240 --> 04:42:26.960
school transformations more achievable and sustainable.

04:42:26.960 --> 04:42:29.480
For this reason we were surprised to see

04:42:29.480 --> 04:42:31.960
that only two of the eight regional TA centers

04:42:31.960 --> 04:42:34.040
listed organizations that work with families.

04:42:34.560 --> 04:42:36.680
When the state has so many organizations

04:42:36.680 --> 04:42:40.200
that support in this area leverage our expertise.

04:42:40.200 --> 04:42:43.440
We CBOs and families want to be part of the solution.

04:42:43.440 --> 04:42:44.960
Thank you.

04:43:03.800 --> 04:43:06.440
Students families and community partners must have an equal

04:43:06.440 --> 04:43:09.240
and respected voice in decision making at every level.

04:43:09.240 --> 04:43:11.720
From our school sites to our districts county

04:43:11.720 --> 04:43:14.480

04:43:14.480 --> 04:43:16.600
families educators and community partners

04:43:16.600 --> 04:43:19.840
is fundamental for transforming the way we're doing school.

04:43:19.840 --> 04:43:22.600
We really need to have an authentic representation

04:43:22.600 --> 04:43:25.240
of shared decision making and truly value

04:43:25.240 --> 04:43:26.720
what our partners bring to the table.

04:43:27.680 --> 04:43:30.680
And we are ready to support as partners in this process.

04:43:30.680 --> 04:43:33.400
Transformation can only happen when students families

04:43:33.400 --> 04:43:36.000
communities educators and district leaders

04:43:36.000 --> 04:43:39.080

and this historic opportunity to create racially

04:44:06.080 --> 04:44:08.960
just relationship centered schools across the state.

04:44:08.960 --> 04:44:11.400
As grants are being implemented we urge the board

04:44:11.400 --> 04:44:13.480

04:44:13.480 --> 04:44:16.520

communities and at the district level every spring.

04:44:20.960 --> 04:44:23.160
The board and department should also communicate

04:44:23.160 --> 04:44:25.800
clearly that plans should be co-developed

04:44:25.800 --> 04:44:28.560

that include students families community and school

04:44:31.120 --> 04:44:33.400
and district educators and that those teams

04:44:33.400 --> 04:44:35.400
should be convened now so that they will have

04:44:35.400 --> 04:44:37.360
the opportunity to work together to determine

04:44:37.360 --> 04:44:39.800
how to reflect on learning measure progress

04:44:39.800 --> 04:44:42.400

04:44:42.440 --> 04:44:44.160

put into this program by CDE, the State Board of Education,

04:48:35.000 --> 04:48:37.360
and the State Transformative Assistance Center.

04:48:37.360 --> 04:48:39.640

I'm a mother and a parent organizer with bone.

04:50:02.520 --> 04:50:06.060
County Padres Unidos and the California partnership.

04:50:06.700 --> 04:50:09.180
Regional technical assistance centers should draw

04:50:09.180 --> 04:50:12.340
on the expertise of students families educators

04:50:12.340 --> 04:50:16.140
in the community just as we hope community school grantees well.

04:50:16.140 --> 04:50:18.940
We were pleased to see that some regional technical

04:50:18.940 --> 04:50:21.220
assistance centers named community partners

04:50:21.220 --> 04:50:22.340
in their applications.

04:50:22.860 --> 04:50:25.460
However we did notice that there were some technical

04:50:25.460 --> 04:50:28.220
support centers that do not have any formal

04:50:28.220 --> 04:50:29.700
community partners listed.

04:50:30.280 --> 04:50:33.560
Regional technical assistance centers should seek formal

04:50:33.560 --> 04:50:36.240
partnerships with community organizations

04:50:36.240 --> 04:50:39.240
that have experienced engaging families and students

04:50:39.760 --> 04:50:42.560
from Black and Latino communities in authentic

04:50:42.560 --> 04:50:44.440
shared decision making processes.

04:50:45.120 --> 04:50:47.320
Plans that are developed in authentic partnership

04:50:47.320 --> 04:50:50.200
with students families community and educators

04:50:50.200 --> 04:50:52.080
are more sustainable over time.

04:50:52.600 --> 04:50:55.000
Nothing about us without us. Thank you.

04:50:55.920 --> 04:50:56.920

I am a parent community organizer with Sacramento Act

PICO and the California partnership.

04:51:13.380 --> 04:51:16.420
We urge the department and board to communicate

04:51:16.420 --> 04:51:20.460
a clear and consistent message and to support schools district

04:51:20.460 --> 04:51:22.900
and county offices who receive planning

04:51:22.900 --> 04:51:25.860
and implementation grants to convene their community

04:51:25.880 --> 04:51:28.080
school shared decision making teams.

04:51:28.080 --> 04:51:30.840
These shared decision making teams must include Black

04:51:30.840 --> 04:51:34.920
Indigenous immigrants and other communities impacted.

04:51:36.760 --> 04:51:39.400
Student families and community members should be supported

04:51:39.400 --> 04:51:42.480
as full and equal partners in discussions and decisions.

04:51:42.480 --> 04:51:45.760
Transformation can only happen when students families

04:51:45.760 --> 04:51:49.480
communities and educators are authentic partners.

04:51:49.480 --> 04:51:52.040

I'm a parent in a community organizer with Sacramento Act

04:52:32.540 --> 04:52:34.540
and PICO in the California Partnership.

04:52:35.060 --> 04:52:38.460
We urge the department to reconsider the priority

04:52:38.460 --> 04:52:41.220
criteria for round two implementation grants.

04:52:41.220 --> 04:52:44.300
We are concerned that limiting grants to schools

04:52:44.300 --> 04:52:47.500
serving 80 percent and in duplicated students

04:52:47.500 --> 04:52:51.140
had had an intended consequences of excluding

04:52:51.140 --> 04:52:54.020
schools that serve high need population experience

04:52:54.040 --> 04:52:58.440
and severe education equity gaps in particular schools

04:52:58.440 --> 04:53:00.880
that have significant population in black

04:53:00.880 --> 04:53:04.640
and African-American students and students with disabilities.

04:53:04.640 --> 04:53:09.000
We urge the CBE to work to ensure that all our schools

04:53:09.000 --> 04:53:12.240
with the students experiencing great equity gaps

04:53:12.240 --> 04:53:15.460
have access to transformative opportunities.

04:53:15.460 --> 04:53:16.560
Thank you.

04:53:16.560 --> 04:53:17.560

04:53:41.040 --> 04:53:43.800
of community organizing and advocacy groups

04:53:43.800 --> 04:53:47.280
that censor black indigenous and brown students families

04:53:47.280 --> 04:53:49.440
and communities of color across the state

04:53:49.440 --> 04:53:51.640
to advance a shared vision for schools.

04:53:52.220 --> 04:53:55.020
We appreciate how at the department board

04:53:55.020 --> 04:53:58.220
and STAC have listened to our feedback rooted

04:53:58.220 --> 04:54:01.980
in the engagement of directly impacted students families

04:54:01.980 --> 04:54:04.500
and educators who the community school program

04:54:04.500 --> 04:54:05.620
is intended to serve.

04:54:06.140 --> 04:54:08.900
Today you will have heard from members of our network

04:54:08.900 --> 04:54:11.180
about how important this opportunity

04:54:11.180 --> 04:54:13.140
is for school transformation.

04:54:13.140 --> 04:54:16.920
We ask the department and STAC to review our proposed

04:54:16.920 --> 04:54:20.140
indicators for racially just relationship centered

04:54:20.160 --> 04:54:25.200

We're excited by efforts so far to align

04:54:43.640 --> 04:54:45.880
the community school program with other school

04:54:45.880 --> 04:54:48.200
transformation initiatives like the historic

04:54:48.220 --> 04:54:51.260
$4.7 billion dollar investment in youth mental health.

04:54:51.820 --> 04:54:54.820
We urge you to support LEAs to leverage all funds

04:54:54.820 --> 04:54:57.100
available from various initiatives towards

04:54:57.100 --> 04:55:00.420
a holistic approach to school and district transformation.

04:55:00.420 --> 04:55:03.820
As our comment letter and the STAC recognize in addition

04:55:03.820 --> 04:55:07.860
to the CCSPP expanded learning universal pre-K

04:55:07.860 --> 04:55:10.580
and mental health funds LEAs must be supported

04:55:10.580 --> 04:55:13.140
to leverage opportunities like the $1.5 billion

04:55:13.140 --> 04:55:15.900
dollars in educator effectiveness multi-million

04:55:15.900 --> 04:55:17.900

04:55:18.080 --> 04:55:20.560
and anti-bias the expansion of the community

04:55:20.560 --> 04:55:22.960
engagement initiative and the overall increase

04:55:22.960 --> 04:55:25.920
in LCFF dollars cross-sector collaboration

04:55:25.920 --> 04:55:28.560
and assistance to align and knit together funds

04:55:28.560 --> 04:55:31.120
for systems transformation will be critical

04:55:31.120 --> 04:55:33.920
to realizing a coherent and shared vision

04:55:33.920 --> 04:55:36.960

More of a follow the theme of some of those calls.

04:58:26.920 --> 04:58:31.840
What are the built in assurances for true authentic

04:58:31.840 --> 04:58:36.840
shared decision making in this process?

04:58:38.200 --> 04:58:40.240
That's one question.

04:58:40.280 --> 04:58:42.800
And then are there parts of the state

04:58:42.800 --> 04:58:44.560
that are underrepresented

04:58:44.560 --> 04:58:47.320
in some of the initial applications?

04:58:48.640 --> 04:58:52.320
How does, how is it looking in terms of the rural parts

04:58:52.320 --> 04:58:55.280
of our state or are they applying at the same rate

04:58:55.280 --> 04:58:56.920
as other parts of our state?

04:58:56.920 --> 04:58:57.760
Thank you.

04:58:58.720 --> 04:59:01.880
Steve do you want to respond to that?

04:59:01.880 --> 04:59:02.720
Sure.

04:59:04.760 --> 04:59:07.640
So in terms of, you know, assurances

04:59:07.640 --> 04:59:11.080
on a genuine authentic engagement.

04:59:12.920 --> 04:59:16.120
What I can say is that this is,

04:59:17.280 --> 04:59:21.440
it was very intentional that this was highlighted

04:59:21.440 --> 04:59:25.760
in the framework, in the way that it was,

04:59:25.760 --> 04:59:30.760
that we brought to and it was adopted by the support.

04:59:31.040 --> 04:59:36.040
I can say that it has been a priority

04:59:38.560 --> 04:59:43.560
of the S-TAC as we've begun this process

04:59:44.920 --> 04:59:49.920
and the webinar very directly focused on that.

04:59:51.880 --> 04:59:55.680
I can say that I anticipate it will be part

04:59:55.680 --> 05:00:00.680
of the formative evaluation and the, you know,

05:00:01.920 --> 05:00:06.920
the implementation, the next implementation grant RFA

05:00:07.480 --> 05:00:12.480
is designed to reflect elements of the planning process

05:00:15.720 --> 05:00:18.400
that would include this.

05:00:18.400 --> 05:00:22.680
And so those are four areas where we think that we can,

05:00:24.040 --> 05:00:27.200
that we can use the tools in our toolbox

05:00:27.200 --> 05:00:29.680
to elevate this work.

05:00:29.680 --> 05:00:32.720
But I think that the fifth is exactly board member

05:00:32.720 --> 05:00:34.760
what you referenced the first time

05:00:34.800 --> 05:00:37.240
in your first clarifying question,

05:00:37.240 --> 05:00:42.240
which is these models for authentic engagement

05:00:42.640 --> 05:00:45.360
and being able to share those models

05:00:45.360 --> 05:00:48.880
both regionally and statewide.

05:00:48.880 --> 05:00:52.880
That's where I see our pathway.

05:00:52.880 --> 05:00:57.880
To your question on areas of slow uptake and higher uptake,

05:01:00.800 --> 05:01:01.640
it is varied.

05:01:02.600 --> 05:01:06.600
There are areas where we did not have strong levels

05:01:06.600 --> 05:01:09.840
of initial applications where we thought that we would.

05:01:10.720 --> 05:01:13.720
And there are areas where we have a quite

05:01:18.360 --> 05:01:20.680
a strong concentration.

05:01:20.680 --> 05:01:25.680
I will say that there were in terms of our rural schools,

05:01:27.920 --> 05:01:30.640
there were areas of the Central Valley

05:01:30.640 --> 05:01:35.640
that were strongly represented in both the planning grant

05:01:38.600 --> 05:01:43.160
and the implementation grant, the initial cycle.

05:01:43.160 --> 05:01:45.240
But there are certainly areas of gaps

05:01:45.240 --> 05:01:49.400
and I'm happy to provide some granular detail.

05:01:51.080 --> 05:01:52.840
There are specific areas of the state

05:01:52.840 --> 05:01:56.560
where board members provide granular detail

05:01:57.560 --> 05:02:02.560
as to where there were strong concentrations

05:02:02.560 --> 05:02:05.480
of applications and where there were more

05:02:05.480 --> 05:02:09.000
kind of what we've been calling community school deserts.

05:02:09.000 --> 05:02:11.200
I hope that answers the question.

05:02:11.200 --> 05:02:13.320
And just to follow up a little bit,

05:02:14.480 --> 05:02:19.000
what is the plan from the department's state tech

05:02:19.000 --> 05:02:22.720
or regional tax to do outreach to those regions

05:02:22.720 --> 05:02:25.920
and to support applications?

05:02:25.960 --> 05:02:27.360
Thank you for the follow up.

05:02:27.360 --> 05:02:29.800
So as Brooklyn discussed,

05:02:30.680 --> 05:02:34.480
it's kind of a bi-directional strategy.

05:02:34.480 --> 05:02:38.440
We are aware of a significant organizing

05:02:38.440 --> 05:02:43.440
that is going on the ground to be able

05:02:43.440 --> 05:02:48.440
to generate higher levels of application.

05:02:50.960 --> 05:02:53.720
I wanna take us back to last year just for a second

05:02:53.760 --> 05:02:58.240
and remind everyone I know that you're aware of them today.

05:02:58.240 --> 05:03:01.360
One of the areas of feedback that we've received

05:03:02.280 --> 05:03:05.160
from dozens and dozens of LEAs

05:03:05.160 --> 05:03:10.160
was that they just had too much on their plate last year

05:03:10.280 --> 05:03:14.560
and that they do intend to apply in this round.

05:03:15.640 --> 05:03:19.600
We very much hope that that is the case.

05:03:19.600 --> 05:03:22.880
I'm encouraged by what I'm hearing from the ground,

05:03:22.880 --> 05:03:25.200
from folks who are doing organizing.

05:03:25.200 --> 05:03:26.720
As Brooklyn mentioned,

05:03:26.720 --> 05:03:30.800
we've doubled the number of webinars

05:03:30.800 --> 05:03:35.280
that we've scheduled today for this round of planning grant.

05:03:35.280 --> 05:03:38.920
We're willing to do more in specific counties

05:03:38.920 --> 05:03:42.840
where that might be requested.

05:03:43.920 --> 05:03:47.080
But we also, we wanna be supportive

05:03:47.080 --> 05:03:50.200
of kind of the grassroots organizing that's going on,

05:03:50.200 --> 05:03:54.040
not by CDE, that we are aware of

05:03:54.040 --> 05:03:56.440
and we've been in conversation about.

05:03:56.440 --> 05:04:01.440
So doubling the number of webinars is part of the work

05:04:02.840 --> 05:04:06.920
and then the ongoing collaborative work

05:04:06.920 --> 05:04:10.520
that we're doing in regular meetings

05:04:10.520 --> 05:04:15.040
with many of our partners is the idea.

05:04:15.040 --> 05:04:17.360
Thank you, I appreciate that.

05:04:17.360 --> 05:04:19.800
Every member of the board who has not yet spoken

05:04:20.400 --> 05:04:22.040
has their hand up, so I see you.

05:04:23.040 --> 05:04:25.040
And I'm excited for this conversation.

05:04:25.040 --> 05:04:28.360
I don't want to short shrift it in any way.

05:04:28.360 --> 05:04:29.240
I do wanna let you know

05:04:29.240 --> 05:04:31.840
that we're about a half an hour now past the time

05:04:31.840 --> 05:04:34.120
we thought that we would have ended this item.

05:04:34.120 --> 05:04:37.040
So we'll probably be about an hour over

05:04:37.040 --> 05:04:39.400
by the time we complete our conversation.

05:04:39.400 --> 05:04:42.000
So I'm encouraging you to be succinct,

05:04:42.000 --> 05:04:46.120
but not to fail to mention anything you want to fail,

05:04:46.120 --> 05:04:48.920
anything that you want to mention.

05:04:48.920 --> 05:04:52.560
So I'm gonna go from member Yoshimoto Tari

05:04:52.560 --> 05:04:56.600
to Orozco Gonzalez, member Glover Woods, member Lewis,

05:04:56.600 --> 05:05:00.200
member Rodriguez and member Escobedo and member Olken.

05:05:00.200 --> 05:05:03.840
You are all in the queue, member Yoshimoto Tari.

05:05:03.840 --> 05:05:05.360
Thank you, thank you.

05:05:05.360 --> 05:05:07.560
So a brief comment and then a question.

05:05:08.680 --> 05:05:10.360
So having recently been in the field,

05:05:10.360 --> 05:05:12.840
I think that I wanna just commend leadership

05:05:12.840 --> 05:05:16.360
because the infrastructure that's been put in place here

05:05:16.360 --> 05:05:19.440
is so critical as well as the evaluation components

05:05:19.440 --> 05:05:23.080
and the democratic nature of this initiative

05:05:23.080 --> 05:05:26.760
because solutions that are co-created with people

05:05:26.760 --> 05:05:27.920
really honors the assets

05:05:27.920 --> 05:05:31.200
that we have in our communities and in our schools.

05:05:31.200 --> 05:05:34.040
And truly schools have to do MOUs,

05:05:34.040 --> 05:05:36.240
service delivery agreements, data use agreements,

05:05:36.240 --> 05:05:37.400
figure out reimbursements

05:05:37.400 --> 05:05:40.280
and that is not something schools are used to doing.

05:05:40.280 --> 05:05:43.560
And so putting this infrastructure in place is incredible

05:05:43.560 --> 05:05:45.560
and thank you for the evaluation components

05:05:45.560 --> 05:05:47.480
that will build coherence.

05:05:47.480 --> 05:05:50.920
I had a question for our exemplary leaders

05:05:50.920 --> 05:05:55.000
at Anaheim Union, Superintendent Matsuda and team,

05:05:55.000 --> 05:05:56.960
including our parent today.

05:05:56.960 --> 05:06:00.040
You really showed the connection

05:06:00.040 --> 05:06:01.720
between the community school efforts

05:06:01.720 --> 05:06:05.040
and by literacy rate, civic engagement,

05:06:05.040 --> 05:06:07.880
you know, civil civic engagement,

05:06:07.880 --> 05:06:10.200
demonstrating how the workforce opportunities

05:06:10.200 --> 05:06:12.560
and action-based learning connects

05:06:12.560 --> 05:06:15.480
with the community school initiative.

05:06:16.400 --> 05:06:17.360
How has your implementation

05:06:17.360 --> 05:06:22.040
of the community school initiative really shown,

05:06:23.360 --> 05:06:25.400
helped your outcomes altogether

05:06:25.400 --> 05:06:27.640
if you were to look at all your dashboard outcomes

05:06:27.640 --> 05:06:29.040
and what is your superpower?

05:06:30.040 --> 05:06:32.320
Fantastic question and I'm gonna defer

05:06:32.320 --> 05:06:34.640
to Dr. Jared Fried for that.

05:06:36.560 --> 05:06:37.560
Thank you, Ms. Ratsuda.

05:06:37.560 --> 05:06:38.920
Yeah, we've seen,

05:06:38.920 --> 05:06:40.520
I remember we've been doing this for quite some time

05:06:40.520 --> 05:06:41.360
and obviously with the grant,

05:06:41.360 --> 05:06:43.320
we've been able to take it and inject steroids

05:06:43.320 --> 05:06:45.200
into what we're doing.

05:06:45.240 --> 05:06:48.480
We have seen, as you saw with our data improving,

05:06:48.480 --> 05:06:50.240
even on our dashboard, we're seeing a rise.

05:06:50.240 --> 05:06:52.320
We're outperforming our demographics

05:06:52.320 --> 05:06:53.560
compared to other districts.

05:06:53.560 --> 05:06:55.600
And even when you look at our A through G rates,

05:06:55.600 --> 05:06:59.080
we're not only surpassing districts who are like us,

05:06:59.080 --> 05:07:00.880
but we're actually working in very close

05:07:00.880 --> 05:07:02.080
and proximity to districts

05:07:02.080 --> 05:07:04.280
who typically would be outperforming us.

05:07:04.280 --> 05:07:05.880
So we're seeing significant improvements.

05:07:05.880 --> 05:07:07.600
We're starting to see less and less students

05:07:07.600 --> 05:07:09.000
ask questions of their teachers,

05:07:09.000 --> 05:07:10.320
why do I have to learn this?

05:07:10.320 --> 05:07:12.000
They're seeing connections to the things

05:07:12.000 --> 05:07:14.520
that they care about being brought into the classroom.

05:07:14.520 --> 05:07:17.160
We've had our instructional coaches or our five seat coaches

05:07:17.160 --> 05:07:18.040
for quite some time now.

05:07:18.040 --> 05:07:19.200
And because of the grant,

05:07:19.200 --> 05:07:20.960
we've now added a tremendous ally

05:07:20.960 --> 05:07:22.360
with our community school teacher leads.

05:07:22.360 --> 05:07:24.160
So they are a tremendous asset

05:07:24.160 --> 05:07:26.000
that we're looking to bring into our systems

05:07:26.000 --> 05:07:28.080
to help support and even further grow this work.

05:07:28.080 --> 05:07:29.400
Our attendance rates have improved,

05:07:29.400 --> 05:07:30.760
our discipline rates have improved,

05:07:30.760 --> 05:07:32.480
kids, our students are just more engaged.

05:07:32.480 --> 05:07:33.920
So we've seen that connection.

05:07:33.920 --> 05:07:36.160
And I know our director of community schools

05:07:36.160 --> 05:07:37.000
and family community engagement,

05:07:37.000 --> 05:07:38.640
Carlos Hernandez is on this call.

05:07:38.640 --> 05:07:40.880
He could probably also share just the impact

05:07:40.880 --> 05:07:43.080
we're seeing across multiple levels.

05:07:43.120 --> 05:07:45.040
I do want to add something because Steve Zimmer

05:07:45.040 --> 05:07:47.080
brought up the evaluation piece,

05:07:47.080 --> 05:07:50.280
looking at pupil attendance and school climate.

05:07:50.280 --> 05:07:52.280
I think as everybody in this room knows

05:07:52.280 --> 05:07:54.760
that we cannot affect school climate

05:07:54.760 --> 05:07:58.320
unless we have teachers involved in this initiative

05:07:58.320 --> 05:08:02.400
and teachers creating more applied learning,

05:08:02.400 --> 05:08:04.080
engaging lesson plans

05:08:04.080 --> 05:08:07.760
that are going to really attract,

05:08:07.760 --> 05:08:10.040
give kids a reason for going to school.

05:08:10.040 --> 05:08:12.320
And I think that that's the model

05:08:12.320 --> 05:08:13.600
that we want to present today.

05:08:13.600 --> 05:08:17.440
The teacher led transformation of schools.

05:08:18.440 --> 05:08:19.280
Thank you.

05:08:19.280 --> 05:08:21.200
I'm going to ask that you continue to teach us

05:08:21.200 --> 05:08:23.480
what you're doing, how you're braiding funding,

05:08:23.480 --> 05:08:25.640
state funding from educator effectiveness dollars

05:08:25.640 --> 05:08:29.480
to expanded learning dollars to mental health dollars

05:08:29.480 --> 05:08:30.680
and keep sharing that with us.

05:08:30.680 --> 05:08:31.520
Thank you.

05:08:32.480 --> 05:08:33.720
Thank you.

05:08:33.720 --> 05:08:35.320
Member Arosco Gonzalez.

05:08:36.840 --> 05:08:38.480
Thank you for your question.

05:08:38.480 --> 05:08:42.400
I just think that that really resonated with me

05:08:42.400 --> 05:08:45.360
because one of the things I'm so passionate about

05:08:45.360 --> 05:08:48.520
is just really having a community of partners

05:08:48.520 --> 05:08:52.440
and your community steering committee is really exemplary

05:08:52.440 --> 05:08:54.560
and I'm so excited to hear more about it.

05:08:55.480 --> 05:08:57.400
I really appreciate collaborative work

05:08:57.400 --> 05:08:59.800
in your shared decision-making.

05:08:59.800 --> 05:09:01.560
That really is at the heart of your work.

05:09:01.560 --> 05:09:03.200
Here's my question.

05:09:03.200 --> 05:09:06.240
What have you learned from this shared decision-making process

05:09:06.240 --> 05:09:09.040
and the implementation of your steering committee?

05:09:09.040 --> 05:09:12.000
Any advice to districts who are nervous about sharing power

05:09:12.000 --> 05:09:14.960
with teachers, students, parents, and community?

05:09:14.960 --> 05:09:18.960
I know in Montebello, we have a planning grant

05:09:18.960 --> 05:09:22.240
and we're in that process of getting started

05:09:22.240 --> 05:09:24.160
and sometimes there's so much hesitation

05:09:24.160 --> 05:09:29.160
in that community of partners and having voice all around

05:09:29.720 --> 05:09:31.880
to really giving authentic partnership

05:09:31.880 --> 05:09:35.160
to every stakeholder in the community.

05:09:35.200 --> 05:09:37.000
What advice do you have for us

05:09:37.000 --> 05:09:38.880
and I would love to continue this conversation

05:09:38.880 --> 05:09:40.880
at another time because I know we're short on time,

05:09:40.880 --> 05:09:43.920
but anything that you can share with us now.

05:09:43.920 --> 05:09:45.000
Thank you for the question.

05:09:45.000 --> 05:09:46.880
We're gonna defer to Carlos Fernandez,

05:09:46.880 --> 05:09:48.960
our director of community schools.

05:09:48.960 --> 05:09:49.800
Thank you.

05:09:49.800 --> 05:09:52.200
Thank you for the opportunity to answer that question.

05:09:52.200 --> 05:09:54.040
We actually live behind me

05:09:54.040 --> 05:09:56.240
is the district community school steering committee

05:09:56.240 --> 05:09:58.840
that is made up of those partners,

05:09:58.840 --> 05:10:00.560
the teacher association, their president,

05:10:00.560 --> 05:10:03.240
and a couple of teacher leads are sitting in the room

05:10:03.600 --> 05:10:05.480
facilitating with the district

05:10:05.480 --> 05:10:08.320
our district community schools manager,

05:10:08.320 --> 05:10:11.200
musical coordinator, students are here,

05:10:11.200 --> 05:10:13.120
high school student, a junior high student,

05:10:13.120 --> 05:10:15.760
couple parents also having and pushing on each other,

05:10:15.760 --> 05:10:16.720
community-based organizations,

05:10:16.720 --> 05:10:18.960
the city of Anaheim representative is here

05:10:18.960 --> 05:10:21.160
and really that you mentioned power,

05:10:21.160 --> 05:10:24.800
to be able to negotiate that opportunity to share

05:10:24.800 --> 05:10:27.800
in that similar vision and priorities

05:10:27.800 --> 05:10:30.040
that meet the needs of our students,

05:10:30.040 --> 05:10:31.320
the families and the community members,

05:10:31.320 --> 05:10:33.160
the city of Anaheim residents,

05:10:33.160 --> 05:10:36.560
the educators, everyone's voices in the room.

05:10:36.560 --> 05:10:40.520
We just had a guest be with us in the morning

05:10:40.520 --> 05:10:42.760
at one of our schools and they were here with us

05:10:42.760 --> 05:10:45.560
hearing and how things are negotiated.

05:10:45.560 --> 05:10:48.960
It really is an opportunity to a model

05:10:48.960 --> 05:10:51.360
what we have been doing at the opportunity

05:10:51.360 --> 05:10:54.360
that our teachers, our different community stakeholders

05:10:54.360 --> 05:10:56.600
are able to share that.

05:10:56.600 --> 05:10:58.760
It is a little nerve wracking

05:10:58.760 --> 05:11:00.520
to give up a little bit of that,

05:11:00.520 --> 05:11:03.720
but the word negotiated is really the word I'd like to say

05:11:03.720 --> 05:11:05.120
where everyone sees each other

05:11:05.120 --> 05:11:07.560
and we see themselves going farther together

05:11:07.560 --> 05:11:10.040
because of the ability to give up that.

05:11:10.040 --> 05:11:11.520
Real quick and thank you Carlos for that,

05:11:11.520 --> 05:11:13.200
but it's very important though

05:11:13.200 --> 05:11:17.080
that those decisions are then communicated to the sites.

05:11:17.080 --> 05:11:19.600
So if you wanna scale up, you need districts

05:11:19.600 --> 05:11:24.600
that have the systems and structures in place at the sites

05:11:24.840 --> 05:11:27.720
because ultimately this needs to work at the sites.

05:11:27.720 --> 05:11:30.320
And I think that's a gap that we've recognized

05:11:31.120 --> 05:11:33.200
with some of the districts that are struggling.

05:11:33.200 --> 05:11:36.400
I see, and I just have a kind of building question on that.

05:11:36.400 --> 05:11:38.400
I know you said it's all collaborative effort.

05:11:38.400 --> 05:11:40.840
I wonder if you're since you're collaborating

05:11:40.840 --> 05:11:42.880
with the Teachers Association,

05:11:42.880 --> 05:11:44.800
if you've included an article

05:11:44.800 --> 05:11:47.160
in your contract for community schools.

05:11:49.920 --> 05:11:51.920
So yes, I'm not the assistant to HR,

05:11:51.920 --> 05:11:53.840
but they're in negotiations right now.

05:11:53.840 --> 05:11:56.040
And we, there is language around community schools.

05:11:56.040 --> 05:11:57.120
And matter of fact, I know,

05:11:57.120 --> 05:11:59.160
even though they haven't settled yet,

05:11:59.160 --> 05:12:00.440
I know that there is an MOU

05:12:00.440 --> 05:12:02.320
that's gonna come out of the negotiations

05:12:02.320 --> 05:12:05.080
to talk about our involvement in community school efforts.

05:12:05.080 --> 05:12:06.560
So that is coming in.

05:12:06.560 --> 05:12:08.360
It's been tentatively agreed upon,

05:12:08.360 --> 05:12:10.560
but it's not finalized until the entire contract.

05:12:10.560 --> 05:12:12.680
But I think it's a great question.

05:12:12.680 --> 05:12:15.840
We remember because we're talking about

05:12:15.840 --> 05:12:18.520
changing the cultures of schools

05:12:18.520 --> 05:12:22.040
and really pushing on some of the more traditional folks

05:12:22.040 --> 05:12:23.440
in our system, right?

05:12:23.440 --> 05:12:28.440
And so the union leadership is vital to embrace things

05:12:29.200 --> 05:12:32.280
the concepts that we all talked about in community schools,

05:12:32.280 --> 05:12:35.120
especially all of our BIPOC

05:12:35.120 --> 05:12:39.120
and our students that have been marginalized in the system.

05:12:39.120 --> 05:12:40.720
So a great question.

05:12:40.720 --> 05:12:44.800
And hopefully, I mean, I think we can get there together.

05:12:44.800 --> 05:12:45.620
Thank you.

05:12:46.720 --> 05:12:48.160
Vice President Glover Woods.

05:12:49.320 --> 05:12:51.000
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

05:12:51.000 --> 05:12:55.400
And again, kudos to the Anaheim Union School District team

05:12:55.400 --> 05:12:58.760
for sharing how you're just transforming education

05:12:58.760 --> 05:13:01.200
for the students in your district.

05:13:01.200 --> 05:13:05.920
Your presentation was inspiring and example,

05:13:05.920 --> 05:13:08.120
a lot of the different pillars that we know

05:13:08.120 --> 05:13:09.440
are essential for community school.

05:13:09.440 --> 05:13:10.520
So thank you.

05:13:10.520 --> 05:13:13.080
Also wanted before I ask my question,

05:13:13.080 --> 05:13:17.560
just recognize and thank the STAC as well as CDE

05:13:17.560 --> 05:13:19.600
for the tremendous amount of work

05:13:19.600 --> 05:13:22.440
that is taking over this last year

05:13:22.440 --> 05:13:25.200
to really get support in place

05:13:25.200 --> 05:13:27.440
for those who are applying and grants

05:13:27.440 --> 05:13:29.200
as well as the implementation grants

05:13:29.200 --> 05:13:31.200
of the community schools program.

05:13:31.200 --> 05:13:34.160
I think we've seen today from our presentation

05:13:34.160 --> 05:13:37.000
as discussions we've had in the past

05:13:37.000 --> 05:13:40.040
that the community schools program

05:13:40.040 --> 05:13:42.000
is really going to be transformative

05:13:42.000 --> 05:13:44.280
for the students that are enrolled at those schools.

05:13:44.280 --> 05:13:45.760
And there's a lot of work.

05:13:47.160 --> 05:13:52.160
I believe key to that is alignment and coordination

05:13:52.840 --> 05:13:54.880
and ongoing collaboration.

05:13:54.880 --> 05:13:58.720
So I have a couple of logistical questions to ask

05:13:58.720 --> 05:14:02.800
and I'm going to pose my question to CDE.

05:14:02.800 --> 05:14:07.800
I in the presentation that there are dollars allocated

05:14:08.600 --> 05:14:12.880
for a CDE office or community schools.

05:14:12.880 --> 05:14:17.880
My question to you is, is that office operational right now?

05:14:19.400 --> 05:14:24.400
And if not, when will it be up and running and staff

05:14:24.440 --> 05:14:27.160
and kind of what is the vision for how that office

05:14:27.160 --> 05:14:30.960
is going to support the tax, the community,

05:14:30.960 --> 05:14:33.520
the county offices getting the coordination grants,

05:14:33.520 --> 05:14:36.320
the community schools implementing in all of those pieces?

05:14:37.680 --> 05:14:39.960
Thank you so much for the question.

05:14:39.960 --> 05:14:42.960
And the answer is, is we hope soon.

05:14:42.960 --> 05:14:45.720
We have a, we have the job posted

05:14:45.720 --> 05:14:49.440
for the educational administrator for the office

05:14:49.440 --> 05:14:54.280
and the job postings in the queue for all of the staffing.

05:14:55.240 --> 05:15:00.240
Of this office, I'll try to be happy to give more detail

05:15:03.240 --> 05:15:05.440
because I think it's a critical question.

05:15:06.440 --> 05:15:11.440
There are three elements to what we're planning

05:15:11.480 --> 05:15:14.200
to do in terms of the office.

05:15:14.200 --> 05:15:17.760
Number one, there is the operational execution of the grant.

05:15:17.760 --> 05:15:22.760
There is the, we anticipate a far higher volume

05:15:25.280 --> 05:15:30.280
of planning and implementation grants in the next cycle.

05:15:31.680 --> 05:15:36.360
Every grant, as you know, there's processes around it.

05:15:37.320 --> 05:15:41.360
And the small team, P and Nisiko I mentioned,

05:15:41.360 --> 05:15:44.600
have literally worked like around the clock

05:15:44.600 --> 05:15:48.120
at certain times to make sure there haven't been delays

05:15:48.120 --> 05:15:49.600
in our program.

05:15:49.640 --> 05:15:54.040
The second element is the collaboration

05:15:54.040 --> 05:15:58.280
and coordination support that you referenced

05:15:58.280 --> 05:16:02.680
and ensuring that we can keep the volume

05:16:02.680 --> 05:16:07.200
of collaborative meetings that we have been engaged with

05:16:07.200 --> 05:16:12.200
to keep that going as the breadth and the depth

05:16:13.240 --> 05:16:15.840
of this program increase.

05:16:15.840 --> 05:16:19.880
And then the third piece is the type of outreach

05:16:19.880 --> 05:16:23.440
that board members and so many of the folks

05:16:23.440 --> 05:16:26.760
that we have been working with in communities

05:16:26.760 --> 05:16:31.760
impressed upon us, which is the need to have staff support

05:16:33.400 --> 05:16:38.400
in areas where community schools implementation

05:16:39.200 --> 05:16:41.680
may need more support.

05:16:41.720 --> 05:16:45.320
We've heard very strongly from our rural

05:16:45.320 --> 05:16:49.160
and tribal communities.

05:16:49.160 --> 05:16:51.800
We have heard very strongly from our ECE community,

05:16:52.800 --> 05:16:57.800
which is directly mentioned in the legislation and more.

05:17:03.280 --> 05:17:05.960
And so that's how we envision it.

05:17:07.560 --> 05:17:11.200
As I said, the educational administrator is posted.

05:17:11.200 --> 05:17:16.200
We have all the other postings in the queue ready to go.

05:17:18.080 --> 05:17:20.760
We hope to have it fully operational by January.

05:17:21.760 --> 05:17:24.920
And I would say, I guess I would take this opportunity

05:17:24.920 --> 05:17:27.040
to also do some advertising.

05:17:28.120 --> 05:17:31.360
This is important and critical work.

05:17:31.360 --> 05:17:35.200
And if board members know folks who are good folks,

05:17:35.200 --> 05:17:38.800
good applicants, we are always looking for strong applicants

05:17:38.800 --> 05:17:42.760
to build our team at CDE and board president.

05:17:42.760 --> 05:17:44.760
Excuse me if I was out of line with that,

05:17:44.760 --> 05:17:49.760
with that last line, but I couldn't resist the temptation.

05:17:49.880 --> 05:17:51.840
Oh, no, that's okay.

05:17:51.840 --> 05:17:54.400
And President Donningham, and if I could please,

05:17:54.400 --> 05:17:56.040
I just had a couple of requests.

05:17:57.240 --> 05:18:02.240
In our future updates, if we can get a updated list

05:18:03.320 --> 05:18:05.680
of the partners for the RTACs,

05:18:05.680 --> 05:18:08.480
I know that there was some conversation about that.

05:18:08.520 --> 05:18:10.760
So if we can have some of that information

05:18:10.760 --> 05:18:15.760
in a future update, as well as to hear more

05:18:15.760 --> 05:18:19.160
of how the community schools and the districts

05:18:19.160 --> 05:18:22.400
supporting the community schools are communicating

05:18:22.400 --> 05:18:26.240
and aligning the work of the community schools

05:18:26.240 --> 05:18:30.040
along with the LCAP and all of the other entities

05:18:30.040 --> 05:18:34.480
that we have in our, and then lastly,

05:18:35.120 --> 05:18:40.120
an advantage of schools that we know are eligible

05:18:41.040 --> 05:18:44.760
for the grant that have not applied for a planning grant

05:18:44.760 --> 05:18:47.440
as of yet, just for some base information.

05:18:47.440 --> 05:18:49.640
But again, thank you so very much,

05:18:49.640 --> 05:18:51.360
President Donningham, and thank you for allowing me

05:18:51.360 --> 05:18:54.320
a little bit more time with my comments and questions.

05:18:54.320 --> 05:18:55.280
Thank you.

05:18:55.280 --> 05:18:56.120
Thank you.

05:18:57.600 --> 05:19:01.520
Thank you very much, and Member Lewis, it's your turn.

05:19:05.360 --> 05:19:07.520
Thank you, President Donningham.

05:19:07.520 --> 05:19:09.840
And I will say that both of my issues

05:19:09.840 --> 05:19:11.760
have already been addressed by other Board members,

05:19:11.760 --> 05:19:13.520
but I still have comment to make.

05:19:13.520 --> 05:19:15.800
And first of all, I want to thank everyone

05:19:15.800 --> 05:19:18.200
for their presentation today on this item,

05:19:18.200 --> 05:19:21.240
and really thank Anaheim Unified School District

05:19:21.240 --> 05:19:24.680
for sharing their plan and their wisdom

05:19:24.680 --> 05:19:26.600
and their experience.

05:19:26.600 --> 05:19:29.480
My two questions were about the outreach,

05:19:29.480 --> 05:19:31.720
what was the follow-up, which has already been answered

05:19:31.720 --> 05:19:34.680
by Mr. Zimmer, and thank you so much for that.

05:19:34.680 --> 05:19:38.880
And also about the shared decision-making

05:19:38.880 --> 05:19:40.440
and stakeholder engagement,

05:19:40.440 --> 05:19:41.640
which he'd already addressed that.

05:19:41.640 --> 05:19:43.920
But I just had one comment to make.

05:19:43.920 --> 05:19:48.040
On the one slide where it outlined what the entity

05:19:48.040 --> 05:19:53.040
that you would eventually engage with to come up

05:19:53.040 --> 05:19:56.920
with what that annual evaluation would look like,

05:19:56.920 --> 05:20:00.920
if maybe the stakeholder engagement could be identified

05:20:02.600 --> 05:20:05.440
as one single item, I know you have it in there

05:20:05.440 --> 05:20:10.440
on that third bullet where it says information sessions,

05:20:10.520 --> 05:20:13.400
including parents and students.

05:20:13.400 --> 05:20:18.400
But if there could be a section on that evaluation tool

05:20:18.480 --> 05:20:22.480
that really spotlights what the stakeholder engagement

05:20:22.480 --> 05:20:24.560
process has been, and that could include

05:20:24.560 --> 05:20:27.960
the steering committee as well as any public meetings

05:20:27.960 --> 05:20:29.920
that are held with regard to get input

05:20:29.920 --> 05:20:33.320
from parents, students, and other stakeholders

05:20:33.320 --> 05:20:35.840
who are not part of that steering committee,

05:20:35.840 --> 05:20:39.560
and also how the information is reported out to the public.

05:20:39.560 --> 05:20:44.360
I think that would give everyone a sense of transparency,

05:20:44.360 --> 05:20:46.520
and we heard that through some of the callers

05:20:46.520 --> 05:20:49.520
who were calling in, that's a concern about making sure

05:20:49.520 --> 05:20:52.400
that all relevant stakeholders are involved

05:20:52.400 --> 05:20:54.720
and know the process, so just a suggestion.

05:20:55.760 --> 05:20:56.600
Thank you.

05:21:00.920 --> 05:21:02.920
That was a very succinct answer.

05:21:04.920 --> 05:21:06.920
I understood it to be a suggestion

05:21:06.920 --> 05:21:10.360
that I agree with all of it, so I want to thank

05:21:10.360 --> 05:21:11.880
board member Lewis.

05:21:11.880 --> 05:21:12.720
That's great.

05:21:12.720 --> 05:21:16.520
Member Rodriguez, you have the last word.

05:21:16.520 --> 05:21:18.360
Okay, and I will keep it short because every-

05:21:18.360 --> 05:21:20.600
Oh no, member Escovedo just put it in.

05:21:20.600 --> 05:21:21.440
Oh, okay.

05:21:21.440 --> 05:21:22.280
Go ahead.

05:21:22.280 --> 05:21:23.800
I'm gonna do the motion, so.

05:21:23.800 --> 05:21:26.000
Okay, member Rodriguez.

05:21:26.000 --> 05:21:27.840
All right, I will be succinct.

05:21:27.880 --> 05:21:29.400
I will be succinct.

05:21:29.400 --> 05:21:34.080
I want to acknowledge Superintendent Matsuda

05:21:34.080 --> 05:21:37.320
and what all of his staff is working on.

05:21:37.320 --> 05:21:38.160
It's wonderful.

05:21:38.160 --> 05:21:40.080
You're an inspiration, the torchbearer,

05:21:41.000 --> 05:21:45.520
and also I want to reiterate what has been said

05:21:45.520 --> 05:21:48.280
about making sure that there's a structure in place,

05:21:48.280 --> 05:21:49.880
that we have all the voices

05:21:49.880 --> 05:21:52.040
that truly represent the community,

05:21:52.040 --> 05:21:55.280
and that we can, you know,

05:21:55.280 --> 05:21:58.120
we still have a lot of that top-down mentality,

05:21:58.120 --> 05:22:01.560
and when I think of the spirit of community schools,

05:22:01.560 --> 05:22:03.600
we all truly have a say,

05:22:03.600 --> 05:22:07.600
and especially the families and our students of color.

05:22:09.280 --> 05:22:10.120
So thank you.

05:22:13.640 --> 05:22:14.560
Thank you so much.

05:22:16.760 --> 05:22:21.360
I think we're ready for a motion, and member Escovedo?

05:22:21.360 --> 05:22:22.200
Yes.

05:22:22.200 --> 05:22:23.040
Now it goes to you.

05:22:23.040 --> 05:22:25.960
Yes, I will motion, number one,

05:22:25.960 --> 05:22:29.760
for the approval of the CCSPP

05:22:29.760 --> 05:22:32.960
Regional Technical Assistance Centers,

05:22:32.960 --> 05:22:34.920
as well as approving

05:22:34.920 --> 05:22:37.920
the California Community Schools Partnership Program

05:22:37.920 --> 05:22:40.760
updated administration plan,

05:22:40.760 --> 05:22:44.600
and delegating to CDE in consultation with,

05:22:44.600 --> 05:22:49.600
and subject to the approval of the executive director of SBE

05:22:50.600 --> 05:22:55.440
to develop a final list of our 22-23

05:22:56.680 --> 05:22:59.200
coordination grant allocations

05:22:59.200 --> 05:23:01.600
consistent with the administration plan.

05:23:04.880 --> 05:23:06.120
I second.

05:23:06.120 --> 05:23:09.400
All right, member Roscoe-Gonzalez, thank you very much.

05:23:09.400 --> 05:23:11.800
At that point, if there's no further discussion,

05:23:11.800 --> 05:23:14.560
we'll ask Brooks to call the roll call vote.

05:23:15.720 --> 05:23:17.000
President Darling-Hammond.

05:23:18.200 --> 05:23:19.040
Aye.

05:23:19.760 --> 05:23:21.480
Member Escovedo.

05:23:21.480 --> 05:23:22.400
Aye.

05:23:22.400 --> 05:23:24.720
Vice President Glover-Woods.

05:23:24.720 --> 05:23:25.840
Aye.

05:23:25.840 --> 05:23:26.680
Member Lewis.

Yes.

05:23:28.720 --> 05:23:30.560
Member McQuillan.

05:23:30.560 --> 05:23:31.920
Yes.

05:23:31.920 --> 05:23:32.760
Member Olken.

05:23:33.680 --> 05:23:34.720
Yes.

05:23:34.720 --> 05:23:37.040
Member Roscoe-Gonzalez.

05:23:37.040 --> 05:23:38.160
Aye.

05:23:38.160 --> 05:23:39.440
Member Petillo-Brownson.

05:23:40.720 --> 05:23:41.800
Yes.

Member Porter.

Yes.

Member Rodriguez.

05:23:50.120 --> 05:23:51.200
Yes.

05:23:51.200 --> 05:23:52.600
Motion carries unanimously.

05:23:53.960 --> 05:23:55.040
Terrific.

05:23:55.040 --> 05:23:58.320
Well, that was an exciting set of presentations,

05:23:58.320 --> 05:24:03.320
and now we will have an exciting break for 15 minutes.

05:24:03.840 --> 05:24:05.480
We'll see you back at 3.05.

05:24:12.000 --> 05:24:13.360
Thank you, Board President.

05:24:15.800 --> 05:24:17.160
Thank you very much.

05:24:18.160 --> 05:24:20.520
Board members, we need to reestablish a quorum,

05:24:20.520 --> 05:24:23.200
so Brooks is going to call the roll.

05:24:23.200 --> 05:24:25.320
President Darling-Hammond.

05:24:25.320 --> 05:24:26.160
Here.

05:24:26.160 --> 05:24:27.520
Member Escovedo.

05:24:27.520 --> 05:24:28.360
Here.

05:24:28.360 --> 05:24:30.400
Vice President Glover-Woods.

05:24:30.400 --> 05:24:31.240
Here.

05:24:31.240 --> 05:24:32.920
Member Lewis.

05:24:32.920 --> 05:24:33.760
Here.

05:24:33.760 --> 05:24:34.600
Member McQuillan.

05:24:35.760 --> 05:24:36.600
Here.

05:24:36.600 --> 05:24:37.440
Member Olken.

05:24:38.440 --> 05:24:39.280
Here.

05:24:39.280 --> 05:24:41.560
Member Roscoe-Gonzalez.

05:24:41.560 --> 05:24:42.480
Here.

05:24:42.480 --> 05:24:44.560
Member Petillo-Brownson.

05:24:44.560 --> 05:24:45.400
Here.

05:24:45.400 --> 05:24:47.000
Member Porter.

05:24:47.840 --> 05:24:48.680
Here.

05:24:48.680 --> 05:24:49.520
Member Rodriguez.

05:24:49.520 --> 05:24:50.360
Here.

05:24:50.360 --> 05:24:51.440
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

05:24:52.560 --> 05:24:53.400
Here.

05:24:53.400 --> 05:24:55.120
Everyone's present.

05:24:55.120 --> 05:24:58.920
All right, we're going to take up regular consent items

05:24:58.920 --> 05:25:00.360
five through nine.

05:25:00.360 --> 05:25:02.080
Understand we have three members

05:25:02.080 --> 05:25:06.200
who need to recuse themselves from item five in this vote.

05:25:06.200 --> 05:25:09.320
Board members Escovedo, Olken, and Yoshimoto-Towry,

05:25:09.320 --> 05:25:11.040
please appear yourself

05:25:11.040 --> 05:25:13.520
by turning off your camera and microphone.

05:25:13.520 --> 05:25:14.920
Please stay close to your computer

05:25:14.920 --> 05:25:18.480
so you can rejoin quickly after the vote.

05:25:18.480 --> 05:25:20.960
And we will now open the phone line for the queue

05:25:20.960 --> 05:25:24.480
for public comment on consent items five through nine.

05:25:25.440 --> 05:25:28.000
Members of the public wishing to provide comment

05:25:28.000 --> 05:25:30.840
on consent items five through nine may do so

05:25:30.840 --> 05:25:33.880
by calling the telephone number and using the access code

05:25:33.880 --> 05:25:36.760
provided on the slide that is shown now.

05:25:36.760 --> 05:25:39.160
Are there any public comments

05:25:39.160 --> 05:25:41.600
on regular consent items five through nine?

05:25:42.560 --> 05:25:44.200
We do have some callers in the queue.

05:25:44.200 --> 05:25:47.360
I'm not sure if they are on the line for the next item.

05:25:47.360 --> 05:25:48.600
I'd like to remind everybody

05:25:48.600 --> 05:25:52.800
if you would like to speak towards consent items

05:25:52.800 --> 05:25:55.360
five through nine, please stay on the line.

05:25:55.360 --> 05:25:57.960
If not, please hang up and dial back in

05:25:57.960 --> 05:25:59.640
when we are on item number 10.

05:25:59.640 --> 05:26:00.460
Thank you.

05:26:02.120 --> 05:26:03.760
I will open the phone line now.

05:26:03.760 --> 05:26:05.560
It looks like some of them dropped.

05:26:05.560 --> 05:26:10.560
Okay, we do not have any callers for regular consent items.

05:26:18.840 --> 05:26:21.960
All right, given that there's no public comment,

05:26:21.960 --> 05:26:25.360
I'll ask for a motion on consent items five through nine.

05:26:25.360 --> 05:26:26.760
Vice President Glover Woods.

05:26:27.920 --> 05:26:32.920
I move that we approve consent items number five through nine.

05:26:33.760 --> 05:26:34.600
Thank you.

05:26:34.600 --> 05:26:35.440
Do I have a second?

05:26:36.600 --> 05:26:37.440
I second.

05:26:37.440 --> 05:26:38.280
Yes, thank you.

05:26:39.440 --> 05:26:42.000
We'll now hold a roll call vote.

05:26:42.000 --> 05:26:43.880
Brooks, please call the roll.

05:26:43.880 --> 05:26:45.680
Present, Darling Hammond.

05:26:45.680 --> 05:26:46.520
Yes, aye.

05:26:48.280 --> 05:26:49.800
Member Escobedo is abstaining.

05:26:49.800 --> 05:26:52.000
Vice President Glover Woods.

05:26:52.000 --> 05:26:53.400
Yes.

05:26:53.400 --> 05:26:55.040
Member Lewis.

05:26:55.040 --> 05:26:55.880
Yes.

05:26:56.840 --> 05:26:58.600
Member McQuillan.

05:26:58.600 --> 05:26:59.920
Yes.

05:26:59.920 --> 05:27:02.000
Member Olken is abstaining, recusal.

05:27:02.000 --> 05:27:03.160
Member Roscoe-Gonzalez.

05:27:04.320 --> 05:27:05.400
Yes.

05:27:05.400 --> 05:27:06.440
Member Patilio-Brownson.

05:27:07.520 --> 05:27:08.480
Yes.

05:27:08.480 --> 05:27:10.000
Member Porter.

05:27:10.000 --> 05:27:11.000
Yes.

05:27:11.000 --> 05:27:11.840
Member Rodriguez.

05:27:12.960 --> 05:27:13.800
Yes.

05:27:15.680 --> 05:27:16.520
Motion passes.

05:27:18.720 --> 05:27:21.720
All right, so board members Escobedo, Olken,

05:27:21.720 --> 05:27:25.360
and Yashimoto-Tarier are now able to rejoin the meeting.

05:27:26.680 --> 05:27:29.920
And let's see if we've got them all.

05:27:32.400 --> 05:27:34.480
Member Escobedo back, yes he is, great.

05:27:35.840 --> 05:27:37.480
Thank you very much.

05:27:37.480 --> 05:27:40.320
Item 10 is a public hearing regarding the appeal

05:27:40.320 --> 05:27:42.720
from an action of the Orange County Committee

05:27:42.720 --> 05:27:45.840
on School District Organization to approve a petition

05:27:45.840 --> 05:27:49.520
to transfer territory from the Orange Unified School District

05:27:49.520 --> 05:27:51.640
to the Tustin Unified School District.

05:27:52.480 --> 05:27:54.560
The California Department of Education recommends

05:27:54.560 --> 05:27:56.640
that the State Board affirm the decision

05:27:56.640 --> 05:27:59.200
of the County Committee to approve the proposal

05:27:59.280 --> 05:28:03.720
to transfer territory from the Orange Unified School District

05:28:03.720 --> 05:28:06.160
to the Tustin Unified School District.

05:28:06.160 --> 05:28:09.480
Regarding the election required to finalize the transfer,

05:28:09.480 --> 05:28:11.720
the CDE further recommends that the State Board

05:28:11.720 --> 05:28:14.080
not expand the area for the election

05:28:14.080 --> 05:28:17.000
beyond the territory proposed for transfer.

05:28:17.000 --> 05:28:20.920
This item will be presented by Larry Shirey of the CDE.

05:28:20.920 --> 05:28:23.160
Larry, you may begin.

05:28:23.160 --> 05:28:25.200
Good afternoon, again, I'm Larry Shirey,

05:28:25.200 --> 05:28:28.640
the School Facilities and Transportation Services Division.

05:28:28.680 --> 05:28:30.680
Today we're considering an appeal

05:28:30.680 --> 05:28:32.120
from an Orange County Committee

05:28:32.120 --> 05:28:34.600
and School District Organization approval

05:28:34.600 --> 05:28:36.000
of a transfer of territory

05:28:36.000 --> 05:28:37.800
from the Orange Unified School District

05:28:37.800 --> 05:28:40.680
to the Tustin Unified School District.

05:28:40.680 --> 05:28:42.280
The Orange Unified School District

05:28:42.280 --> 05:28:43.960
is the appellant in this matter.

05:28:46.880 --> 05:28:49.880
Most of you on the board have only heard

05:28:49.880 --> 05:28:52.720
one reorganization item, the one we had in July,

05:28:52.720 --> 05:28:56.480
about the formation of the Northgate Unified School District

05:28:56.480 --> 05:28:58.320
from a portion of Mount Diablo.

05:29:00.360 --> 05:29:03.960
The State Board is the lead agency, as we mentioned,

05:29:03.960 --> 05:29:07.000
for all formations of new school districts.

05:29:07.000 --> 05:29:10.800
And that statute requires you to either approve

05:29:10.800 --> 05:29:13.080
or disapprove those proposals.

05:29:13.080 --> 05:29:15.400
For territory transfers, the County Committee

05:29:15.400 --> 05:29:17.600
is the lead agency with the responsibility

05:29:17.600 --> 05:29:20.080
for approving or disapproving.

05:29:20.080 --> 05:29:23.040
Local approvals can be appealed to the State Board,

05:29:23.040 --> 05:29:26.320
and when that happens, it's your statutory responsibility

05:29:27.160 --> 05:29:30.040
to either affirm or reverse the local action.

05:29:31.400 --> 05:29:36.040
Just to make the distinction between those two processes,

05:29:36.040 --> 05:29:39.400
since we're in the heart of football season

05:29:39.400 --> 05:29:41.000
and the World Series is going on,

05:29:41.000 --> 05:29:42.880
I'd like to use a sports analogy

05:29:45.120 --> 05:29:48.320
to describe what we do regarding appeals.

05:29:48.320 --> 05:29:52.320
The CDE treats appeals much as if there is a call

05:29:52.720 --> 05:29:57.280
on the football field or a call on the baseball diamond,

05:29:57.280 --> 05:30:00.600
and one of the teams challenges the call.

05:30:00.600 --> 05:30:02.480
When that happens, the officials can make

05:30:02.480 --> 05:30:04.880
one of three determinations.

05:30:04.880 --> 05:30:08.760
After reviewing all the information they have,

05:30:08.760 --> 05:30:13.720
they can say, yep, we see something that confirms the call,

05:30:13.720 --> 05:30:18.520
so that will be what our call is, the call is confirmed.

05:30:18.520 --> 05:30:21.240
Or they can see something that causes them

05:30:21.240 --> 05:30:24.760
to want to reverse the call, that the call wasn't accurate,

05:30:24.760 --> 05:30:29.760
and then their call will be that the call was reversed.

05:30:30.280 --> 05:30:34.500
If they don't find compelling information,

05:30:34.500 --> 05:30:36.720
compelling evidence either way,

05:30:36.720 --> 05:30:39.760
then the call is gonna be the decision stands,

05:30:39.760 --> 05:30:41.440
the call in the field stands.

05:30:41.440 --> 05:30:44.480
And at the risk of spoiling the outcome

05:30:44.480 --> 05:30:48.760
of our recommendation here, that's what our recommendation,

05:30:48.760 --> 05:30:51.920
our general recommendation is, that the call stands.

05:30:55.300 --> 05:30:59.760
The territory transfer itself is 459 parcels

05:30:59.760 --> 05:31:01.960
with about 127 students.

05:31:03.120 --> 05:31:06.160
The Orange County Superintendent received the petition

05:31:06.160 --> 05:31:09.600
to transfer that territory signed by at least 25%

05:31:09.600 --> 05:31:13.520
of the voters residing in the Panorama Heights area

05:31:13.520 --> 05:31:15.440
of North Tustin.

05:31:15.440 --> 05:31:17.480
The county committee determined that all nine

05:31:17.480 --> 05:31:20.240
minimum threshold conditions of the education code

05:31:20.240 --> 05:31:23.920
are substantially met, and then it approved the petition

05:31:23.920 --> 05:31:25.280
on an eight to one vote.

05:31:26.160 --> 05:31:29.320
It also, since the Orange Unified District

05:31:30.600 --> 05:31:34.400
opposes the transfer, an election is required

05:31:34.400 --> 05:31:36.160
to give final approval.

05:31:36.160 --> 05:31:40.600
So the county committee decided after looking at the effect

05:31:40.600 --> 05:31:43.400
of the proposal on surrounding communities

05:31:43.400 --> 05:31:45.640
that there was nothing significant enough for them

05:31:45.640 --> 05:31:49.280
to expand the election area beyond the area

05:31:49.280 --> 05:31:51.520
proposed for transfer, excuse me,

05:31:51.520 --> 05:31:56.520
which is the default area and statute for election area.

05:31:59.920 --> 05:32:04.920
CDE recommendations are that you affirm the actions

05:32:04.920 --> 05:32:07.480
of the county committee to approve the proposal,

05:32:07.480 --> 05:32:10.160
and that you establish the territory proposed

05:32:10.160 --> 05:32:12.120
for transfer as the election area

05:32:12.120 --> 05:32:13.980
when it does have to go to election.

05:32:13.980 --> 05:32:16.780
Again, that was the termination of the county committee.

05:32:20.300 --> 05:32:24.940
The map on the right is a general description

05:32:24.940 --> 05:32:28.380
of where the proposed transfer area is

05:32:28.380 --> 05:32:31.020
in relation to the school district boundary,

05:32:31.020 --> 05:32:33.220
which is the dark black line,

05:32:33.220 --> 05:32:38.220
and the boundary of the North Tustin unincorporated area.

05:32:40.180 --> 05:32:42.180
It's an unincorporated area.

05:32:42.180 --> 05:32:45.020
Also, it's a census designated place

05:32:45.020 --> 05:32:46.680
according to the Census Bureau.

05:32:47.740 --> 05:32:50.540
We find some lack of clarity regarding

05:32:50.540 --> 05:32:53.320
the actual boundaries of North Tustin,

05:32:53.320 --> 05:32:55.820
which we'll get into a little bit later.

05:32:55.820 --> 05:32:58.420
But the boundary that we accept for our analysis

05:32:58.420 --> 05:33:01.220
is what is on that map on the left.

05:33:01.220 --> 05:33:05.220
Petitioner reasons for transferring are on the right.

05:33:05.220 --> 05:33:08.100
They note that their territory,

05:33:08.100 --> 05:33:10.460
their neighborhood is in North Tustin,

05:33:10.460 --> 05:33:12.860
the majority of which is already in

05:33:12.860 --> 05:33:14.860
the Tustin Unified School District.

05:33:14.860 --> 05:33:17.900
Many of their students already attend Tustin Unified

05:33:17.900 --> 05:33:20.380
on inter-district transfer agreements,

05:33:20.380 --> 05:33:23.760
according to Orange Unified.

05:33:23.760 --> 05:33:25.660
For this current school year,

05:33:25.660 --> 05:33:29.820
22 of the 127 students attend Tustin Unified.

05:33:29.820 --> 05:33:32.180
Their community-based activities

05:33:32.180 --> 05:33:34.980
are all in Tustin Unified,

05:33:34.980 --> 05:33:39.300
and that the county committee approved a similar transfer

05:33:39.340 --> 05:33:40.700
a number of years ago.

05:33:43.780 --> 05:33:47.220
Both Orange Unified and Tustin Unified are large districts.

05:33:47.220 --> 05:33:52.220
Orange at over 26,000, Tustin just over 22,000.

05:33:52.300 --> 05:33:54.340
And the two districts are relatively similar

05:33:54.340 --> 05:33:57.940
in terms of the composition of students

05:33:57.940 --> 05:33:59.880
on both racial ethnic categories,

05:33:59.880 --> 05:34:03.540
as well as on some of the socioeconomic indicators,

05:34:03.540 --> 05:34:04.720
as you can see there.

05:34:05.400 --> 05:34:10.400
Tustin Unified is a little more minority,

05:34:11.080 --> 05:34:14.400
but the minority groups between the district

05:34:14.400 --> 05:34:16.320
do change a little bit.

05:34:17.240 --> 05:34:21.720
Hispanic, Latino students are about 10% higher,

05:34:21.720 --> 05:34:23.560
10 percentage points higher.

05:34:23.560 --> 05:34:27.080
In Orange Unified, while in Tustin Unified,

05:34:27.080 --> 05:34:30.480
Asian students are about 10 percentage points higher.

05:34:30.480 --> 05:34:32.680
But there are a great deal similarities.

05:34:33.680 --> 05:34:37.080
On not only the racial ethnic composition,

05:34:37.080 --> 05:34:41.560
but also on students who are socioeconomically disadvantaged,

05:34:41.560 --> 05:34:42.680
who are English learners,

05:34:42.680 --> 05:34:45.780
are eligible for the free reduced price meal program.

05:34:50.300 --> 05:34:52.000
The county committee, as I stated,

05:34:52.000 --> 05:34:54.760
found that all nine minimum threshold standards

05:34:55.640 --> 05:34:58.960
are substantially met by the territory transfer proposal.

05:34:58.960 --> 05:35:01.920
They voted eight to one to approve the transfer,

05:35:01.920 --> 05:35:03.560
and then, again, they established

05:35:03.560 --> 05:35:07.360
the territory proposed for transfer as the election,

05:35:07.360 --> 05:35:09.720
just a summary of what the county committee did.

05:35:14.320 --> 05:35:19.000
The Orange Unified appeal has three major components.

05:35:19.000 --> 05:35:21.720
They claim that five of the minimum standards

05:35:21.720 --> 05:35:24.080
are not substantially met,

05:35:24.080 --> 05:35:26.680
and that the proposed territory transfer

05:35:26.680 --> 05:35:29.760
should not be approved, should not have been approved,

05:35:29.800 --> 05:35:31.200
and that if approved,

05:35:31.200 --> 05:35:34.680
if the state board allows the proposal to go through,

05:35:34.680 --> 05:35:36.960
the election area should be expanded

05:35:36.960 --> 05:35:39.120
to include the attendance area

05:35:39.120 --> 05:35:41.600
of the El Modena High School.

05:35:41.600 --> 05:35:45.020
That high school is the high school that serves

05:35:45.020 --> 05:35:46.720
this area proposed for transfer,

05:35:46.720 --> 05:35:49.360
and also contains the attendance boundaries

05:35:49.360 --> 05:35:52.440
of the middle school and the elementary school

05:35:52.440 --> 05:35:53.600
that serve that area.

05:35:56.760 --> 05:35:58.200
Here are the five standards

05:35:58.200 --> 05:36:00.300
that the appellant claims are not met.

05:36:01.480 --> 05:36:04.560
They believe, they claim that the community identity

05:36:04.560 --> 05:36:08.680
of the districts will be damaged by the proposal.

05:36:10.080 --> 05:36:11.920
County committee found, as I said,

05:36:11.920 --> 05:36:15.080
found that at what went, that was substantially met.

05:36:15.080 --> 05:36:16.400
We agree with them.

05:36:16.400 --> 05:36:18.080
I'm gonna jump down to the fourth one,

05:36:18.080 --> 05:36:20.400
increased property values.

05:36:20.400 --> 05:36:25.400
That standard states that a proposal should not be approved

05:36:26.040 --> 05:36:28.000
if it's primarily for the purposes

05:36:28.000 --> 05:36:29.920
of increased property values.

05:36:29.920 --> 05:36:31.440
County committee did not find that.

05:36:31.440 --> 05:36:34.040
We found no, even though we accept

05:36:34.040 --> 05:36:38.320
that property values may go up, up to 18%,

05:36:38.320 --> 05:36:42.280
based on the district of residence,

05:36:42.280 --> 05:36:45.660
we find, we do not find any rationale to support

05:36:45.660 --> 05:36:50.660
that the primary reason for the petitioner's desire

05:36:50.660 --> 05:36:53.680
to transfer territory is because of property values.

05:36:53.680 --> 05:36:57.480
The other three we'll address in the next few slides.

05:37:02.640 --> 05:37:05.120
Orange Unified claims that the proposal

05:37:05.120 --> 05:37:09.360
will promote segregation in the districts

05:37:09.360 --> 05:37:12.960
and will harm the district's ability

05:37:12.960 --> 05:37:16.340
to educate students in an integrated environment.

05:37:16.340 --> 05:37:19.860
And those claims are based on a comparison

05:37:19.860 --> 05:37:22.440
of the existing racial ethic composition

05:37:23.120 --> 05:37:25.840
of the schools that currently serve

05:37:25.840 --> 05:37:29.240
this proposed transfer area to the schools

05:37:29.240 --> 05:37:31.680
that would serve it in Tustin Unified

05:37:31.680 --> 05:37:33.520
if the proposal were approved.

05:37:34.840 --> 05:37:38.800
CDE agrees that there are substantial differences

05:37:38.800 --> 05:37:42.400
between the sets of schools,

05:37:42.400 --> 05:37:44.460
but does not agree with the claim

05:37:44.460 --> 05:37:46.480
that the transfer will negatively affect

05:37:46.480 --> 05:37:48.920
the Orange Unified's ability to educate students

05:37:48.920 --> 05:37:52.240
in an integrated environment for two reasons.

05:37:52.240 --> 05:37:54.640
First, as we noted previously,

05:37:54.640 --> 05:37:57.260
the racial ethnic comparison of the districts

05:37:57.260 --> 05:38:00.680
is much closer than is the comparison

05:38:00.680 --> 05:38:02.740
between these sets of districts.

05:38:02.740 --> 05:38:04.680
Neighborhoods within a district,

05:38:06.340 --> 05:38:09.580
that composition reflects a neighborhood

05:38:09.580 --> 05:38:12.160
that is served by the school,

05:38:12.160 --> 05:38:15.840
and those neighborhoods do not reflect

05:38:15.840 --> 05:38:16.980
the district as a whole,

05:38:16.980 --> 05:38:20.420
do not necessarily reflect the districts as a whole.

05:38:20.420 --> 05:38:24.100
For example, Tustin Unified has three high schools.

05:38:25.060 --> 05:38:27.260
You can see Foothill High School

05:38:27.260 --> 05:38:31.660
with 42%, 43% Hispanic or Latino,

05:38:31.660 --> 05:38:36.260
and 41% white, but if you look at Tustin High School,

05:38:36.260 --> 05:38:39.220
that high school is 82% Hispanic, Latino,

05:38:39.220 --> 05:38:41.060
and less than 8% white.

05:38:41.060 --> 05:38:43.940
The third high school, Beckman High School,

05:38:43.940 --> 05:38:48.220
is 22% Hispanic, 25% white,

05:38:48.220 --> 05:38:51.180
and over 40% of the students are Asian.

05:38:51.180 --> 05:38:54.820
So again, you kind of aggregate all those together,

05:38:54.820 --> 05:38:58.580
and the district's composition

05:38:58.580 --> 05:39:00.580
looks very similar to Orange Unified.

05:39:03.340 --> 05:39:06.300
Secondly, that's not the point,

05:39:06.300 --> 05:39:08.940
that's not the point of this condition anyway.

05:39:08.940 --> 05:39:11.860
The point is that the proposed transfer

05:39:11.860 --> 05:39:15.960
will not negatively affect the district's ability

05:39:15.960 --> 05:39:20.160
or a school's ability to educate its students

05:39:20.160 --> 05:39:22.240
in an integrated environment.

05:39:22.240 --> 05:39:24.600
This shows the effects of the transfer

05:39:24.600 --> 05:39:26.560
on Panorama Elementary School,

05:39:26.560 --> 05:39:29.280
which is the smallest elementary school

05:39:29.280 --> 05:39:31.920
in the second smallest elementary school

05:39:31.920 --> 05:39:33.900
in the Orange Unified School District.

05:39:34.800 --> 05:39:36.940
If all the students are transferred out,

05:39:38.160 --> 05:39:40.720
all the elementary students are transferred out

05:39:40.720 --> 05:39:42.760
from the proposed transfer area,

05:39:42.760 --> 05:39:46.360
then it would only change the racial ethic composition

05:39:46.360 --> 05:39:49.240
by a couple percentage points at most.

05:39:49.240 --> 05:39:51.480
Looking at the middle school and the high school,

05:39:51.480 --> 05:39:53.240
which are much larger schools

05:39:53.240 --> 05:39:55.800
with fewer students from the transfer area,

05:39:55.800 --> 05:39:58.920
the change is in tenths of a percentage point.

05:40:02.520 --> 05:40:05.600
The next standard that the Orange Unified claims

05:40:05.600 --> 05:40:08.260
is not substantially met is negative effect

05:40:08.260 --> 05:40:12.680
on the educational programs of the schools or districts.

05:40:13.600 --> 05:40:17.560
Orange Unified notes that Panorama Elementary student losses

05:40:17.560 --> 05:40:21.520
will result in reduced staffing at that school,

05:40:21.520 --> 05:40:24.600
will result in grade level combination classes

05:40:24.600 --> 05:40:26.520
where none already exist,

05:40:26.520 --> 05:40:29.720
and lower levels of parental participation.

05:40:29.720 --> 05:40:32.120
And they also claim that the middle and high schools

05:40:32.120 --> 05:40:36.760
will also see staff reductions and less parental involvement.

05:40:36.760 --> 05:40:38.760
Our findings regarding this condition

05:40:38.760 --> 05:40:41.400
is that less than one half of a percent

05:40:41.400 --> 05:40:45.000
of the district enrollment is affected

05:40:45.000 --> 05:40:48.080
based on what we've seen in territory transfers

05:40:48.080 --> 05:40:50.360
in past decades.

05:40:51.480 --> 05:40:54.920
Student losses will occur over a number of years.

05:40:54.920 --> 05:40:56.640
Whenever a territory transfers,

05:40:56.640 --> 05:40:59.840
it's not like all the students are gonna leave their teachers,

05:40:59.840 --> 05:41:02.200
leave their school, leave their classmates,

05:41:02.200 --> 05:41:06.160
that shift will happen over a period of time.

05:41:07.000 --> 05:41:12.000
The educational programs of Orange Unified are very good,

05:41:13.080 --> 05:41:15.240
and no one is complaining about the quality

05:41:15.240 --> 05:41:16.880
of the educational program.

05:41:16.880 --> 05:41:19.440
Orange Unified notes that there are many exemplary

05:41:19.440 --> 05:41:23.040
and innovative educational programs provided in the district,

05:41:23.040 --> 05:41:25.040
including identification of a number

05:41:25.040 --> 05:41:26.560
of award-winning schools,

05:41:26.560 --> 05:41:29.760
seven gold-ribboned and distinguished secondary schools,

05:41:29.760 --> 05:41:32.640
19 elementary gold-ribboned schools,

05:41:32.640 --> 05:41:35.440
and the designation of El Medina High School

05:41:35.440 --> 05:41:37.640
as the best public high school in Orange County

05:41:37.640 --> 05:41:40.320
by parenting Orange County magazine.

05:41:40.320 --> 05:41:44.160
So we're talking about programs that are functioning well,

05:41:44.160 --> 05:41:45.880
showing good results.

05:41:45.880 --> 05:41:50.880
So we do not see that the loss of fewer than,

05:41:52.440 --> 05:41:55.160
less than one percent or less than half of a percent

05:41:55.160 --> 05:41:57.440
of the students in the district will have any effect

05:41:57.440 --> 05:42:00.320
of those high-functioning programs.

05:42:00.320 --> 05:42:03.040
Additionally, the appeal does not identify

05:42:03.040 --> 05:42:06.720
any specific effects on educational program

05:42:06.720 --> 05:42:09.520
only regarding what might happen

05:42:09.520 --> 05:42:12.760
at the Panamara Elementary School regarding staffing.

05:42:18.440 --> 05:42:21.720
The last condition that we're gonna look at

05:42:21.720 --> 05:42:24.360
is that the Orange Unified School District believes

05:42:24.360 --> 05:42:28.600
that this transfer will cause a significant

05:42:28.600 --> 05:42:32.280
negative fiscal effect on Orange Unified.

05:42:33.600 --> 05:42:35.880
Specifically, the transfer would exacerbate

05:42:35.880 --> 05:42:38.760
long-term declining enrollment in the district.

05:42:38.760 --> 05:42:42.520
The loss of ADA would result in decreased district funding,

05:42:42.520 --> 05:42:44.480
and the loss of assessed valuation

05:42:44.480 --> 05:42:47.320
would reduce the school bonding capacity for the district.

05:42:48.640 --> 05:42:51.520
Our findings, again, it's very similar

05:42:51.520 --> 05:42:54.240
to the ones on the educational program.

05:42:56.360 --> 05:42:59.240
Less than half a percent of the enrollment is affected.

05:43:00.080 --> 05:43:04.160
Enrollment decline that has been less than

05:43:04.160 --> 05:43:08.240
what the district has projected for the past few years.

05:43:08.240 --> 05:43:11.520
Less than one percent of the district's assessed valuation

05:43:11.520 --> 05:43:14.200
is affected, and this is a district that's seen

05:43:14.200 --> 05:43:17.360
its assessed valuation grow about 24%

05:43:17.360 --> 05:43:18.800
over the past few years.

05:43:21.400 --> 05:43:24.520
So in summary, we agree with all the county committee's

05:43:24.520 --> 05:43:29.520
findings that the nine minimum threshold standards

05:43:29.720 --> 05:43:31.360
are substantially met.

05:43:31.360 --> 05:43:35.840
However, as we discussed at the July meeting,

05:43:35.840 --> 05:43:38.720
approval of a district reorganization

05:43:38.720 --> 05:43:40.280
is a two-step process.

05:43:40.280 --> 05:43:43.760
We first look at those nine conditions

05:43:43.760 --> 05:43:48.280
and then try to determine if there are reasons

05:43:48.280 --> 05:43:51.360
to move forward with the change.

05:43:51.400 --> 05:43:55.720
That's the court's interpretation of what the state board

05:43:55.720 --> 05:43:58.400
as well as the county committee's responsibility are,

05:43:58.400 --> 05:44:02.440
and to help guide us in terms of reasons we can look at,

05:44:02.440 --> 05:44:06.040
the legislature has given us its intent

05:44:06.040 --> 05:44:08.800
that local educational needs and concerns

05:44:08.800 --> 05:44:12.040
shall serve as the basis for a future reorganization

05:44:12.040 --> 05:44:14.800
of districts in each county.

05:44:14.800 --> 05:44:17.720
We'll look at some of those needs and concerns next.

05:44:22.200 --> 05:44:25.400
The state board has considerable discretion

05:44:25.400 --> 05:44:28.720
when it comes to school district reorganization matters.

05:44:28.720 --> 05:44:31.760
You can consider really any issue that you want

05:44:31.760 --> 05:44:34.120
when it comes to making your decision.

05:44:34.120 --> 05:44:36.760
Again, using the sports analogy,

05:44:36.760 --> 05:44:40.760
what we're doing here is we're looking for things

05:44:40.760 --> 05:44:45.760
that would confirm the county committee's action.

05:44:46.760 --> 05:44:49.480
Two of those issues that the petitioners have brought up

05:44:49.760 --> 05:44:52.040
is that there's a greater sense of community identity

05:44:52.040 --> 05:44:55.400
with North Tustin and the Tustin Unified School District

05:44:55.400 --> 05:44:57.520
and that the county committee previously approved

05:44:57.520 --> 05:45:00.920
a transfer of another Tustin, North Tustin neighborhood

05:45:00.920 --> 05:45:03.120
from Orange Unified to Tustin Unified.

05:45:07.800 --> 05:45:11.080
The map on the left shows the transfer area

05:45:11.080 --> 05:45:14.760
and its relation to the district boundary.

05:45:14.760 --> 05:45:16.760
Orange Unified School serving the area

05:45:16.760 --> 05:45:19.440
and Tustin Unified School serving the area

05:45:20.440 --> 05:45:25.440
if the transfer is approved are also noted on the map.

05:45:25.680 --> 05:45:29.440
Tustin's Arroyo Elementary is about a mile further away

05:45:29.440 --> 05:45:32.000
than is Orange Unified's Panorama School

05:45:32.000 --> 05:45:34.120
which is really kind of a community school there.

05:45:34.120 --> 05:45:37.920
It's named after the, as I noted, Panorama Heights

05:45:37.920 --> 05:45:41.000
is a neighborhood and Panorama Elementary School

05:45:41.000 --> 05:45:42.360
kind of goes with that.

05:45:43.440 --> 05:45:47.440
Well, Tustin Unified Middle and High Schools

05:45:47.440 --> 05:45:50.400
are about three quarters and a half a mile closer

05:45:50.400 --> 05:45:52.520
than our Orange Unified School District.

05:45:52.520 --> 05:45:55.600
However, we don't see those distances

05:45:55.600 --> 05:45:57.680
as being particularly significant,

05:45:57.680 --> 05:46:01.480
especially since Orange Unified provides bus transportation

05:46:01.480 --> 05:46:03.680
while Tustin Unified would not.

05:46:04.680 --> 05:46:07.080
As I mentioned, the proposed transfer area

05:46:07.080 --> 05:46:11.120
is part of Panorama Heights and as the name suggests,

05:46:11.120 --> 05:46:14.000
the community is located at elevation.

05:46:14.000 --> 05:46:15.760
The only access to the community

05:46:15.760 --> 05:46:19.800
is on the southeastern edge which abuts Tustin Unified.

05:46:19.800 --> 05:46:21.880
Again, that geographic feature

05:46:21.880 --> 05:46:25.640
is not particularly compelling for us.

05:46:25.640 --> 05:46:30.160
The map on the right is the U.S. Census Bureau

05:46:30.160 --> 05:46:35.160
boundaries for the North Tustin Census Designated Place.

05:46:36.680 --> 05:46:38.840
And according to the Census Bureau,

05:46:38.840 --> 05:46:43.200
the petition area is not within the boundaries

05:46:43.200 --> 05:46:46.560
of North Tustin as the census designated place.

05:46:46.560 --> 05:46:48.480
And that gets to the lack of clarity

05:46:48.480 --> 05:46:53.480
that I mentioned earlier regarding what North Tustin is

05:46:53.520 --> 05:46:58.520
but the Orange County maps are a little different

05:46:58.760 --> 05:47:01.880
as are Google maps but as I mentioned,

05:47:01.880 --> 05:47:05.160
the boundaries that we are using in our analysis

05:47:05.160 --> 05:47:10.040
assumes that the petitionary is in North Tustin

05:47:10.040 --> 05:47:12.640
despite the Census Bureau's indication.

05:47:14.040 --> 05:47:18.440
So that lack of clarity somewhat diminishes

05:47:18.440 --> 05:47:21.680
the argument of community identity for us

05:47:21.680 --> 05:47:24.480
even though I need to note that the Orange County Committee

05:47:24.480 --> 05:47:27.560
focused on this as its primary rationale

05:47:27.560 --> 05:47:30.640
for approval of the territory transfer

05:47:30.640 --> 05:47:32.880
and they didn't state that specifically

05:47:32.880 --> 05:47:37.880
but through our review of the audio recordings of meetings

05:47:38.040 --> 05:47:39.800
and written transcripts of meetings,

05:47:39.800 --> 05:47:41.760
that was a determination that we made.

05:47:43.880 --> 05:47:47.720
There was, there have been previous transfer approvals

05:47:47.720 --> 05:47:51.400
from North Tustin area to from Orange Unified

05:47:51.400 --> 05:47:54.320
to North for Tustin Unified.

05:47:54.320 --> 05:47:58.880
The most recent was the Rocking Horse Ridge transfer

05:47:58.880 --> 05:48:01.760
and that's again not particularly compelling to us.

05:48:01.760 --> 05:48:03.400
It was a very different circumstance

05:48:03.400 --> 05:48:06.440
than what the proposal is here.

05:48:06.440 --> 05:48:09.160
Rocking Horse Ridge was a new development

05:48:09.160 --> 05:48:11.720
that was split by the district boundaries

05:48:12.680 --> 05:48:16.000
and Orange Unified did not oppose that one.

05:48:16.000 --> 05:48:17.520
They were neutral on that one.

05:48:22.360 --> 05:48:24.840
As looking for reasons to confirm the action,

05:48:24.840 --> 05:48:28.040
you can also consider any reason or concern you want

05:48:28.040 --> 05:48:30.840
in making your decision to reverse local approval

05:48:30.840 --> 05:48:32.600
of a territory transfer.

05:48:32.600 --> 05:48:35.880
Two that we often look at are,

05:48:35.880 --> 05:48:38.880
one, the territory transfer likely would establish

05:48:38.880 --> 05:48:41.440
a precedent for future transfers.

05:48:42.200 --> 05:48:44.680
Or the transfer removes a student population

05:48:44.680 --> 05:48:47.080
that has higher socioeconomic status.

05:48:51.320 --> 05:48:56.320
In our opinion, there are two other areas of North Tustin,

05:48:56.840 --> 05:48:58.920
the unincorporated area of North Tustin

05:48:58.920 --> 05:49:02.000
that would remain in Orange Unified

05:49:02.000 --> 05:49:04.200
if the transfer area were approved,

05:49:04.200 --> 05:49:06.360
if the transfer took place.

05:49:06.360 --> 05:49:09.200
Area one and area two, they're on the map.

05:49:09.240 --> 05:49:12.880
The real light red area shows the boundary.

05:49:14.120 --> 05:49:18.480
In looking at these areas, we think, we believe

05:49:18.480 --> 05:49:21.840
that the number of homes and the number of students

05:49:21.840 --> 05:49:23.640
combined in those two areas

05:49:23.640 --> 05:49:25.880
is less than what's in the transfer area.

05:49:25.880 --> 05:49:30.880
So we don't see this as a particularly compelling rationale

05:49:30.920 --> 05:49:33.120
to reverse the action.

05:49:33.120 --> 05:49:37.040
I will also note, however, that area two there,

05:49:37.040 --> 05:49:38.520
Panorama Elementary School,

05:49:38.520 --> 05:49:41.520
Orange Unified Elementary School is located in that area

05:49:41.520 --> 05:49:45.000
which would create additional concerns

05:49:45.000 --> 05:49:48.800
if there was a transfer proposal from that area.

05:49:56.400 --> 05:49:59.200
As with the earlier examination

05:49:59.200 --> 05:50:01.800
of racial ethnic composition of the schools

05:50:01.800 --> 05:50:04.720
that serve the area or that would serve the area,

05:50:04.760 --> 05:50:07.120
there are differences between those sets of schools,

05:50:07.120 --> 05:50:11.160
between Orange Unified and Tustin Unified.

05:50:11.160 --> 05:50:13.920
But again, as with racial composition,

05:50:13.920 --> 05:50:17.920
the district numbers are much more similar.

05:50:17.920 --> 05:50:22.920
And again, as with our racial ethnic comparisons,

05:50:23.280 --> 05:50:26.480
the point is, would there be a negative effect

05:50:26.480 --> 05:50:31.040
on what is in the schools, any of the schools?

05:50:31.040 --> 05:50:35.360
And even though we did not collect information

05:50:35.360 --> 05:50:38.040
on students in the area

05:50:38.040 --> 05:50:40.320
who were socioeconomically disadvantaged,

05:50:40.320 --> 05:50:43.320
English learners or eligible for the free

05:50:43.320 --> 05:50:47.600
and reduced priced meal program,

05:50:49.120 --> 05:50:52.080
given the small numbers and the size of the schools,

05:50:52.080 --> 05:50:54.080
we do not believe there would be any effect

05:50:54.080 --> 05:50:57.240
on any of the schools and especially not at the district.

05:50:58.240 --> 05:51:03.040
So in summary, our findings are as follows.

05:51:03.040 --> 05:51:07.320
We find that all minimum standards are substantially met

05:51:07.320 --> 05:51:09.680
by the territory transfer proposal.

05:51:09.680 --> 05:51:12.600
The county committee demonstrated strong support

05:51:12.600 --> 05:51:14.640
for the transfer, eight to one vote,

05:51:14.640 --> 05:51:17.600
and identified a reason for its action,

05:51:17.600 --> 05:51:20.600
a community identity issue that we discussed.

05:51:20.600 --> 05:51:24.840
The CDE finds, excuse me, no local educational reason

05:51:24.840 --> 05:51:27.280
compelling enough to support the transfer,

05:51:27.280 --> 05:51:30.440
but we also find no educational reason or concern

05:51:30.440 --> 05:51:32.760
compelling enough to reverse

05:51:32.760 --> 05:51:35.000
county committee approval of the transfer.

05:51:35.000 --> 05:51:40.000
So again, using our sports metaphor or analogy,

05:51:40.440 --> 05:51:44.400
the local approval, in our opinion, should stand.

05:51:44.400 --> 05:51:47.720
The CDE also finds no effects on other communities

05:51:47.720 --> 05:51:50.040
that warrant expanding the election area.

05:51:50.840 --> 05:51:54.960
We recommend, as we mentioned earlier,

05:51:54.960 --> 05:51:57.080
that the state board affirm the actions

05:51:57.080 --> 05:52:00.160
of the county committee and establish the territory

05:52:00.160 --> 05:52:03.920
proposed for transfer as the election area.

05:52:03.920 --> 05:52:05.680
I know you have a public hearing scheduled.

05:52:05.680 --> 05:52:08.080
I can respond to any clarifying questions

05:52:08.080 --> 05:52:09.440
that you might have before then,

05:52:09.440 --> 05:52:12.160
or we can do that after the public hearing

05:52:12.160 --> 05:52:14.480
at the discretion of the board president.

05:52:20.120 --> 05:52:21.440
I'm on mute.

05:52:21.440 --> 05:52:25.040
If there are any just factual clarifying questions

05:52:25.040 --> 05:52:29.360
that you wanna ask now, we could do that,

05:52:29.360 --> 05:52:31.760
but I'm not seeing any hands up.

05:52:31.760 --> 05:52:35.000
So I think we will move to the public hearing,

05:52:35.880 --> 05:52:38.200
and then we'll have any additional questions

05:52:38.200 --> 05:52:41.600
in conversation and discussion thereafter.

05:52:41.600 --> 05:52:45.760
I hereby open the public hearing at 3.34 p.m.

05:52:45.760 --> 05:52:47.680
We will first hear from the petitioners

05:52:47.720 --> 05:52:50.400
who are in favor of the territory transfer.

05:52:50.400 --> 05:52:53.400
They will have 12 minutes to make their presentation.

05:52:53.400 --> 05:52:55.200
We will then hear from Orange Unified

05:52:55.200 --> 05:52:59.360
and those who are opposed to the territory transfer.

05:52:59.360 --> 05:53:02.360
They will have 12 minutes to make their presentation.

05:53:02.360 --> 05:53:05.040
After the presentations, we will open up the phone line

05:53:05.040 --> 05:53:07.720
for public comment from individuals

05:53:07.720 --> 05:53:10.280
who are not part of either presentation.

05:53:10.280 --> 05:53:12.600
Petitioners, you may begin.

05:53:18.520 --> 05:53:21.240
Hello, just doing a sound check.

05:53:21.240 --> 05:53:23.200
This is Marlene Graham speaking.

05:53:23.200 --> 05:53:24.400
We can hear you.

05:53:24.400 --> 05:53:27.880
Awesome, I am going to share my screen.

05:53:27.880 --> 05:53:29.920
I do believe we sent it in earlier,

05:53:29.920 --> 05:53:34.920
but I will hope this will come through.

05:53:35.920 --> 05:53:37.600
We can see it.

05:53:37.600 --> 05:53:39.400
Great, thank you so much.

05:53:39.400 --> 05:53:42.600
Well, good afternoon, honorable President Darlene Hammond

05:53:42.600 --> 05:53:44.200
and fellow board members.

05:53:44.200 --> 05:53:48.280
I thank you for your time and to just let you know,

05:53:48.280 --> 05:53:49.640
it is a great honor and privilege

05:53:49.640 --> 05:53:51.920
to speak in front of you today.

05:53:51.920 --> 05:53:55.680
I'd also like to take a second to thank Layari Shirey

05:53:55.680 --> 05:53:58.960
and the rest of the CDE Executive Office staff

05:53:58.960 --> 05:54:00.280
for their thorough report.

05:54:01.480 --> 05:54:05.360
We most definitely agree with the CDE recommendations

05:54:05.360 --> 05:54:08.760
to affirm the decision of the local County Committee

05:54:08.760 --> 05:54:11.440
to approve the proposal to transfer territory

05:54:11.440 --> 05:54:14.360
from Orange Unified to Tustin Unified.

05:54:14.360 --> 05:54:18.600
And we also agree with the motion

05:54:18.600 --> 05:54:20.760
that they do not expand the area

05:54:20.760 --> 05:54:22.480
for the election beyond the territory

05:54:22.480 --> 05:54:25.400
proposed for the transfer.

05:54:25.400 --> 05:54:27.960
So I will go to next slide.

05:54:27.960 --> 05:54:32.040
Before I start, I did want to just do a quick minute

05:54:32.040 --> 05:54:35.520
just to introduce myself again,

05:54:35.520 --> 05:54:36.840
and I will turn it over also

05:54:36.840 --> 05:54:40.240
to my fellow Chief Petitioner, Jennifer Lampman.

05:54:40.240 --> 05:54:42.640
As I said, my name is Marlene Graham.

05:54:42.640 --> 05:54:46.520
I'm a proud fourth generation Californian.

05:54:46.520 --> 05:54:49.040
I had the pleasure of going through

05:54:49.040 --> 05:54:52.600
all of the California public schools from elementary

05:54:52.600 --> 05:54:53.720
all the way through high school

05:54:53.720 --> 05:54:58.720
in my beloved hometown of Montevideo Unified School District.

05:54:59.680 --> 05:55:04.600
And I'm also a daughter of a retired LA USD teacher

05:55:04.600 --> 05:55:05.440
from Echo Park.

05:55:06.200 --> 05:55:10.240
And lastly, my dad would be unhappy

05:55:10.240 --> 05:55:14.680
if I didn't talk about the fact that he was a immigrant

05:55:14.680 --> 05:55:19.520
at 17 years old with who greatly benefit

05:55:19.520 --> 05:55:21.920
from the great programs in California.

05:55:21.920 --> 05:55:26.040
He came to this country speaking only Spanish from Nicaragua

05:55:26.040 --> 05:55:29.480
and has excelled in life thankfully

05:55:29.480 --> 05:55:32.760
to the great education for the California public schools.

05:55:33.720 --> 05:55:37.680
I am a mother of three, one still in elementary school

05:55:37.680 --> 05:55:40.400
and twins in middle school

05:55:40.400 --> 05:55:44.360
that went through the elementary school at Tustin Unified

05:55:44.360 --> 05:55:48.120
and is now still on transfer to their middle school.

05:55:48.120 --> 05:55:51.920
And I bring that up because this is why I'm here.

05:55:51.920 --> 05:55:54.520
This is why Jennifer Lampman's here.

05:55:54.520 --> 05:55:57.520
These are children that get to walk to school right now

05:55:58.640 --> 05:56:02.320
from their homes to their local neighborhood schools

05:56:02.360 --> 05:56:03.280
in North Tustin.

05:56:04.600 --> 05:56:06.720
So that's just a little bit about me.

05:56:06.720 --> 05:56:09.920
I just wanted to give you a picture

05:56:09.920 --> 05:56:13.120
of my deep roots in California

05:56:13.120 --> 05:56:17.720
and my deep support of California public schools

05:56:17.720 --> 05:56:21.560
because I believe there's nothing more important to family

05:56:21.560 --> 05:56:26.560
in feeling safe and not having anxiety to question

05:56:26.560 --> 05:56:29.040
where your children will be able to go to school

05:56:29.040 --> 05:56:30.560
and that they will be able to go to school

05:56:30.560 --> 05:56:34.680
with their friends and in neighborhood community.

05:56:34.680 --> 05:56:36.160
Jennifer.

05:56:36.160 --> 05:56:38.080
And in the interest of our time,

05:56:38.080 --> 05:56:39.880
I'll just introduce myself really quickly.

05:56:39.880 --> 05:56:42.960
I too am a product of public schools in California

05:56:42.960 --> 05:56:45.120
and the daughter of a 30 year high school math teacher

05:56:45.120 --> 05:56:47.640
and specifically in Irvine, California.

05:56:47.640 --> 05:56:49.680
And so I just wanna say thank you for all the hard work

05:56:49.680 --> 05:56:50.520
that you guys do.

05:56:50.520 --> 05:56:54.480
We definitely understand what a challenge teachers face

05:56:54.480 --> 05:56:55.840
and the hard work and commitment

05:56:55.840 --> 05:56:57.240
to the students that they have.

05:56:57.240 --> 05:56:59.040
So now I'll give it back to Marty.

05:57:00.040 --> 05:57:01.560
Thanks, Jen.

05:57:01.560 --> 05:57:05.680
So I wanna hit on this point most definitely

05:57:05.680 --> 05:57:09.760
because the idea that we are a community,

05:57:09.760 --> 05:57:12.160
even though we are unincorporated,

05:57:12.160 --> 05:57:16.800
should not be up for grabs.

05:57:16.800 --> 05:57:18.720
We are unincorporated,

05:57:18.720 --> 05:57:21.160
but we do have many great associations

05:57:21.160 --> 05:57:24.640
that help make sure that our interests

05:57:24.640 --> 05:57:28.960
and that we're served through our community as we align.

05:57:29.960 --> 05:57:34.800
And so the idea is that North Houston really is a,

05:57:34.800 --> 05:57:37.000
I like to call it a secret little gem

05:57:37.000 --> 05:57:39.400
in Orange County being unincorporated.

05:57:39.400 --> 05:57:41.600
We don't have sidewalks,

05:57:41.600 --> 05:57:43.200
but yet we walk out,

05:57:43.200 --> 05:57:46.560
we walk and say hi to neighbors every single day.

05:57:46.560 --> 05:57:49.200
And with that, it comes with the idea

05:57:49.200 --> 05:57:51.600
that we probably live in our community

05:57:51.600 --> 05:57:53.320
because we love that freedom

05:57:53.320 --> 05:57:56.200
and we especially believe in the parental rights

05:57:56.200 --> 05:57:58.760
of our community to have our children go to schools

05:57:59.720 --> 05:58:03.040
based in our community within walking distance

05:58:03.040 --> 05:58:05.720
from our homes when they are old enough to walk

05:58:05.720 --> 05:58:07.680
from home to schools.

05:58:08.880 --> 05:58:10.240
And as mentioned earlier,

05:58:10.240 --> 05:58:14.440
there were previous suits that went uncontested before,

05:58:14.440 --> 05:58:19.440
one in 2012 and then another one previously in 2002.

05:58:20.080 --> 05:58:22.080
Go to the next slide.

05:58:22.080 --> 05:58:24.240
Just to give you a brief timeline,

05:58:24.240 --> 05:58:27.200
we started this petition in 2015.

05:58:27.240 --> 05:58:28.640
We began conversations

05:58:28.640 --> 05:58:31.680
or we attempted to begin conversations with Orange Unified.

05:58:31.680 --> 05:58:35.560
We never received any response.

05:58:35.560 --> 05:58:37.480
And so, but we did have meetings

05:58:37.480 --> 05:58:39.520
with testing unified register voters

05:58:39.520 --> 05:58:41.360
and we started the process.

05:58:41.360 --> 05:58:43.680
We collected over 350 signatures

05:58:43.680 --> 05:58:48.680
more than the requirement to submit the petition.

05:58:50.480 --> 05:58:52.360
We went through the entire process

05:58:52.360 --> 05:58:55.960
was received the approval from OCDE

05:58:56.000 --> 05:58:59.240
where we received that we substantially met

05:58:59.240 --> 05:59:00.320
all nine requirements.

05:59:00.320 --> 05:59:03.560
The one dissenting vote was from a current board member

05:59:03.560 --> 05:59:04.640
from Orange Unified.

05:59:06.360 --> 05:59:09.520
The appeal process started in 2017.

05:59:09.520 --> 05:59:12.560
And the reason why I put in the COVID delay

05:59:12.560 --> 05:59:14.120
because we don't blame everyone,

05:59:14.120 --> 05:59:16.240
we have all been on this pause.

05:59:16.240 --> 05:59:19.520
So we understand the five year delay,

05:59:19.520 --> 05:59:21.240
but here we are five years later.

05:59:21.240 --> 05:59:23.160
And I show this timeline

05:59:23.160 --> 05:59:26.000
because this is seven years of commitment

05:59:26.000 --> 05:59:27.440
from our community.

05:59:27.440 --> 05:59:30.800
It might be only Jen and I speaking in front of you today,

05:59:30.800 --> 05:59:34.960
but our vast majority of 459 homes, neighbors,

05:59:34.960 --> 05:59:38.000
we have stayed committed to this, talked about this

05:59:38.000 --> 05:59:40.480
through every medium that you can imagine

05:59:40.480 --> 05:59:43.240
from neighborhood meetings to next door

05:59:43.240 --> 05:59:45.520
to everything you can imagine.

05:59:45.520 --> 05:59:49.440
So the point is we have been committed to this petition.

05:59:50.440 --> 05:59:54.320
And just really quickly to talk about this North Tustin

05:59:54.320 --> 05:59:56.960
community profile and our identity with this,

05:59:58.360 --> 06:00:01.840
as mentioned, it's roughly about 10,000 homes

06:00:01.840 --> 06:00:05.040
across this large unincorporated area.

06:00:05.040 --> 06:00:09.680
We are 100% serviced by the county,

06:00:09.680 --> 06:00:12.400
not from any other city,

06:00:12.400 --> 06:00:14.360
not from the city of Orange or any other city.

06:00:14.360 --> 06:00:16.040
It is all by the county.

06:00:16.040 --> 06:00:20.040
And as such, the census designated area,

06:00:20.040 --> 06:00:22.280
there are multiple small communities,

06:00:22.280 --> 06:00:23.920
if you wanna call them that.

06:00:23.920 --> 06:00:26.760
Cowan Heights, East Tustin, Lemon Heights, North Tustin,

06:00:26.760 --> 06:00:30.760
and our South Panorama Heights, including Red Hill.

06:00:30.760 --> 06:00:34.720
Our mailing address, my mailing address on the hill

06:00:34.720 --> 06:00:37.520
and surrounding Panorama Heights area,

06:00:37.520 --> 06:00:41.120
it is recognized by the U.S. Postal Service as North Tustin.

06:00:41.120 --> 06:00:44.320
It's what's on my passport, my driver's license,

06:00:44.320 --> 06:00:45.280
all my mail.

06:00:46.440 --> 06:00:49.200
And also my ballot that I just turned it.

06:00:49.200 --> 06:00:53.760
So our diverse community, I wanna highlight that too,

06:00:53.760 --> 06:00:57.520
because I came from a diverse neighborhood

06:00:57.520 --> 06:00:59.880
where I grew up in Montebello and I loved it.

06:00:59.880 --> 06:01:02.400
And when I picked my community to move to next,

06:01:02.400 --> 06:01:03.760
that's what I wanted to live in,

06:01:03.760 --> 06:01:06.600
in an area where we felt we had people

06:01:06.600 --> 06:01:09.680
from different backgrounds and experiences

06:01:09.680 --> 06:01:13.280
and provided a rich environment for our families.

06:01:13.280 --> 06:01:17.440
What's really of note also is the rest of our neighbors,

06:01:17.440 --> 06:01:19.920
my neighbors that I can touch across the street

06:01:21.160 --> 06:01:26.120
are already part of Tustin Unified, 95% of them.

06:01:26.120 --> 06:01:28.320
Panorama Heights too, and we call it too,

06:01:28.320 --> 06:01:31.040
because what you saw previously in the map,

06:01:31.040 --> 06:01:32.880
you might've seen the word Panorama Heights

06:01:32.880 --> 06:01:34.240
and it was cut in half,

06:01:34.240 --> 06:01:36.800
because our other neighbors in Panorama Heights

06:01:38.080 --> 06:01:40.960
were drawn in for Tustin Unified.

06:01:40.960 --> 06:01:42.840
So what we're looking at is to unite

06:01:42.840 --> 06:01:45.520
the last 4% that we represent,

06:01:45.520 --> 06:01:48.760
that is still currently in Orange Unified

06:01:48.760 --> 06:01:50.320
to be part of Tustin Unified.

06:01:52.240 --> 06:01:55.600
You saw this map earlier, what this really is,

06:01:55.600 --> 06:01:59.080
is a map of Tustin Unified School District boundaries.

06:02:00.080 --> 06:02:04.200
As mentioned, the 95% of North Tustin,

06:02:04.200 --> 06:02:08.080
which we are most 100% definitely part of North Tustin,

06:02:09.040 --> 06:02:12.320
this is the map that we're looking to include.

06:02:12.320 --> 06:02:16.000
As I mentioned, 95% already under Tustin Unified,

06:02:16.000 --> 06:02:20.360
we represent the missing 4%, and as in total,

06:02:20.360 --> 06:02:23.200
the affected students are less than a percent,

06:02:23.200 --> 06:02:27.360
which is a third of a percent of Orange Unified's population.

06:02:29.280 --> 06:02:31.560
I'm gonna turn that over to Jen at this point.

06:02:32.960 --> 06:02:34.520
Okay, thank you.

06:02:34.520 --> 06:02:37.960
Just really quickly, I know we heard the argument

06:02:38.840 --> 06:02:41.360
that there would be a negative impact on finances,

06:02:41.360 --> 06:02:42.720
so we just wanted to highlight

06:02:42.720 --> 06:02:44.520
what we have been able to find,

06:02:44.520 --> 06:02:46.400
because obviously that's not our intention

06:02:46.400 --> 06:02:49.560
is to hurt anybody in this endeavor.

06:02:49.560 --> 06:02:51.000
But in looking at Orange's budget

06:02:51.000 --> 06:02:52.120
for the current fiscal year,

06:02:52.120 --> 06:02:56.400
they're projecting $341 million in revenues

06:02:56.400 --> 06:02:59.520
compared to 335 million in expenses,

06:02:59.520 --> 06:03:01.720
and are actually projecting to increase their fund balance

06:03:01.720 --> 06:03:04.320
over the past fiscal year.

06:03:04.320 --> 06:03:07.320
As a finance director for a local city

06:03:07.720 --> 06:03:10.040
whose budget is sadly only 45 million,

06:03:10.040 --> 06:03:13.200
I can strongly agree with the CDE's assessment

06:03:13.200 --> 06:03:18.200
that the transfer of less than 1% of the territory

06:03:18.520 --> 06:03:22.640
would not have a negative impact financially on Orange,

06:03:22.640 --> 06:03:24.080
and in fact, it'd be so small,

06:03:24.080 --> 06:03:26.160
it'd be considered de minimis.

06:03:26.160 --> 06:03:29.000
Same goes for their bonding capacity with the assessed value.

06:03:29.000 --> 06:03:32.000
I professionally have seen the reports

06:03:32.000 --> 06:03:33.200
on the assessed value growth

06:03:33.200 --> 06:03:35.640
and agree that there would be no impact whatsoever

06:03:35.680 --> 06:03:37.840
on any bonding capacity in the future

06:03:37.840 --> 06:03:40.640
should the transfer be pushed forward.

06:03:40.640 --> 06:03:43.200
In addition, there was no fiscal impact cited

06:03:43.200 --> 06:03:45.640
for the previous transfer of Rocking Horse Ridge.

06:03:45.640 --> 06:03:47.240
It wasn't just uncontested,

06:03:47.240 --> 06:03:50.280
they actually stated there would be no fiscal impact,

06:03:50.280 --> 06:03:52.840
and the argument that it was a new development,

06:03:52.840 --> 06:03:54.720
it actually was built in 1981,

06:03:54.720 --> 06:03:56.840
but not transferred for 2012,

06:03:56.840 --> 06:03:58.360
so it wasn't really cleaning up

06:03:58.360 --> 06:04:00.400
the separation of a new development.

06:04:00.400 --> 06:04:03.400
It was really similar to what we're looking

06:04:03.400 --> 06:04:04.920
at doing right now,

06:04:04.960 --> 06:04:07.600
and I just wanted to highlight there on the bottom right

06:04:07.600 --> 06:04:11.280
that some of the projections for declining enrollment,

06:04:11.280 --> 06:04:14.480
each as the CDE analyzed and reported out,

06:04:15.360 --> 06:04:16.320
didn't come to fruition.

06:04:16.320 --> 06:04:17.600
They didn't lose as many students

06:04:17.600 --> 06:04:19.200
as they had originally thought,

06:04:19.200 --> 06:04:22.840
and even as one of the board members is highlighting,

06:04:22.840 --> 06:04:25.240
the enrollment is up in Orange over projections

06:04:25.240 --> 06:04:28.480
while most other districts are experiencing declines.

06:04:28.480 --> 06:04:30.000
Next slide, please.

06:04:31.840 --> 06:04:34.080
One thing on, also just really quick,

06:04:34.080 --> 06:04:36.120
we also wanna highlight there's a new development

06:04:36.120 --> 06:04:38.600
in Orange Heights of approximately 1,200 homes

06:04:38.600 --> 06:04:39.960
being constructed,

06:04:39.960 --> 06:04:43.480
which should more than make up for development impact fees,

06:04:43.480 --> 06:04:45.120
and also any sort of vacancies,

06:04:45.120 --> 06:04:47.080
they're gonna have a significant amount of students

06:04:47.080 --> 06:04:50.320
that could easily backfill the vacancies created,

06:04:50.320 --> 06:04:52.280
specifically in Panorama Elementary.

06:04:54.160 --> 06:04:55.200
As Marlene communicated,

06:04:55.200 --> 06:04:56.760
our goal of this petition's always been

06:04:56.760 --> 06:04:57.920
to unite North Houston,

06:04:57.920 --> 06:05:02.440
and while property values increasing are only good

06:05:02.440 --> 06:05:04.160
when you go to sell your home,

06:05:04.160 --> 06:05:07.200
and as my son has made me promise never to sell my house,

06:05:08.360 --> 06:05:12.160
that's definitely not our goal of this petition,

06:05:12.160 --> 06:05:14.400
and the appraisal that was cited,

06:05:14.400 --> 06:05:17.800
just to highlight, was done in 2013 under a scope

06:05:17.800 --> 06:05:20.160
for determining the chance of success

06:05:20.160 --> 06:05:21.800
for a proposed bond measure,

06:05:21.800 --> 06:05:26.560
so it wasn't looking at specific zoning or property sizes.

06:05:26.560 --> 06:05:28.440
It's not an apples-to-apples comparison,

06:05:28.440 --> 06:05:31.160
so given the timeframe that's elapsed,

06:05:31.160 --> 06:05:33.800
and just really the big picture scope of it,

06:05:33.800 --> 06:05:38.800
it's really not a support tool for this argument by Orange.

06:05:40.760 --> 06:05:42.320
But really what we wanna highlight,

06:05:42.320 --> 06:05:46.120
the biggest one is that this is personal for us.

06:05:46.120 --> 06:05:48.080
Sorry to interrupt, your time is up.

06:05:49.440 --> 06:05:50.280
Thank you.

06:05:55.040 --> 06:05:56.400
Thank you very much.

06:05:56.400 --> 06:05:57.840
Thank you.

06:05:57.840 --> 06:05:59.200
At this point, we will hear

06:05:59.200 --> 06:06:02.240
from the Orange Unified representatives,

06:06:02.240 --> 06:06:05.600
and those who are opposed to the territory transfer,

06:06:05.600 --> 06:06:08.240
they will have 12 minutes to make their presentation.

06:06:10.360 --> 06:06:12.120
After the presentations, I'll note

06:06:12.120 --> 06:06:15.000
that we're gonna open up the phone line for public comment

06:06:15.000 --> 06:06:17.240
from individuals who are not part of the presentation,

06:06:17.240 --> 06:06:19.360
so they can get ready.

06:06:21.480 --> 06:06:22.520
Okay, thank you.

06:06:22.520 --> 06:06:24.480
Good morning, members of the Board of Education

06:06:24.480 --> 06:06:26.360
and State Superintendent Thurman.

06:06:26.400 --> 06:06:28.120
I am Andrea Yamasaki,

06:06:28.120 --> 06:06:30.480
President of the seven-member Board of Education

06:06:30.480 --> 06:06:32.920
of the Orange Unified School District.

06:06:32.920 --> 06:06:35.320
We appreciate the opportunity to present

06:06:35.320 --> 06:06:39.760
on this important issue that deeply impacts Orange Unified.

06:06:39.760 --> 06:06:42.520
Our presentation is a summary of the highlights

06:06:42.520 --> 06:06:47.000
due to the limited time afforded to us today.

06:06:47.000 --> 06:06:49.600
Orange Unified opposes the transfer

06:06:49.600 --> 06:06:52.280
because it is a drastic measure

06:06:52.280 --> 06:06:54.560
that has severe consequences

06:06:54.560 --> 06:06:58.040
and negative impacts on student education.

06:06:58.040 --> 06:07:00.880
We encourage this body to scrutinize

06:07:00.880 --> 06:07:03.120
and to deny this petition.

06:07:03.120 --> 06:07:07.000
Deference to the 2017 County Committee recommendation

06:07:07.000 --> 06:07:09.880
is neither required nor just.

06:07:09.880 --> 06:07:13.400
I am now going to call on Vice President Kristen Erickson.

06:07:14.680 --> 06:07:15.800
Thank you.

06:07:15.800 --> 06:07:18.640
Good afternoon, members of the State Board of Education

06:07:18.640 --> 06:07:20.120
and State Superintendent Thurman.

06:07:20.120 --> 06:07:21.520
My name is Chris Erickson,

06:07:21.520 --> 06:07:25.640
and I was elected to the OUSD Board in 2018.

06:07:25.640 --> 06:07:27.240
My trustee area includes

06:07:27.240 --> 06:07:29.720
Orange Unified-Santorama Elementary School

06:07:29.720 --> 06:07:31.680
and Santiago Charter Middle School,

06:07:31.680 --> 06:07:33.480
which serves students residing

06:07:33.480 --> 06:07:36.320
in the proposed transfer area.

06:07:36.320 --> 06:07:40.600
I come also as a proud graduate of El Medina High School

06:07:40.600 --> 06:07:44.240
and a parent of two former Santiago Middle School students

06:07:44.240 --> 06:07:46.520
and two El Medina High School graduates

06:07:46.520 --> 06:07:49.560
who I'm proud to say have graduated from college

06:07:49.560 --> 06:07:51.400
and one has gone back to serve

06:07:51.400 --> 06:07:54.600
as a public school teacher at Santiago Middle School.

06:07:54.600 --> 06:07:56.440
The other is attending law school now.

06:07:57.360 --> 06:08:00.680
I've been aware of this issue before this committee

06:08:00.680 --> 06:08:05.200
since 2016, and I spoke as a parent at that time

06:08:05.200 --> 06:08:09.800
to the County Committee opposing this transfer five years ago.

06:08:09.800 --> 06:08:11.760
I found it inconceivable,

06:08:11.760 --> 06:08:13.400
and I still find it inconceivable,

06:08:13.400 --> 06:08:16.960
that a tiny group of mostly wealthy people

06:08:16.960 --> 06:08:20.480
who knowingly moved into Orange Unified School District

06:08:20.480 --> 06:08:23.360
could force their will and acquire,

06:08:23.360 --> 06:08:26.640
like a hostile takeover, a portion of OUSD

06:08:26.640 --> 06:08:28.920
and merge it into another district

06:08:28.920 --> 06:08:31.680
for no real reason except their personal feelings

06:08:31.680 --> 06:08:34.320
of identity with another community.

06:08:34.320 --> 06:08:36.120
This area we are talking about

06:08:36.120 --> 06:08:38.280
has been part of Orange Unified School District

06:08:38.280 --> 06:08:40.680
for nearly 70 years.

06:08:40.680 --> 06:08:44.480
80% of the students that reside in this area

06:08:44.480 --> 06:08:48.000
are enrolled in Orange Unified School District School

06:08:48.000 --> 06:08:48.840
currently.

06:08:50.240 --> 06:08:53.800
This is a view from Panorama Elementary School

06:08:53.800 --> 06:08:57.000
looking west up Crawford Canyon Road.

06:08:57.000 --> 06:09:00.240
The red car that you see is within one-tenth of a mile

06:09:00.240 --> 06:09:02.520
of Panorama Elementary School.

06:09:02.520 --> 06:09:05.280
All of the houses you see here have been in Orange Unified

06:09:05.280 --> 06:09:09.600
since it was formed in 1954.

06:09:09.600 --> 06:09:11.520
If the proposed transfer is approved,

06:09:11.520 --> 06:09:13.640
all of the students residing in these houses

06:09:13.640 --> 06:09:15.760
that you see up here on the hill

06:09:15.760 --> 06:09:18.720
will no longer be part of Orange Unified School District.

06:09:19.560 --> 06:09:21.480
This is another view of all of the homes

06:09:21.480 --> 06:09:24.960
that are currently within Orange Unified looking east.

06:09:24.960 --> 06:09:28.320
The houses in the foreground will be left in Orange Unified,

06:09:28.320 --> 06:09:31.320
but all the houses that you see on the hill back there

06:09:31.320 --> 06:09:33.760
will be transferred to Test and Unified

06:09:33.760 --> 06:09:35.640
should the transfer be approved.

06:09:37.120 --> 06:09:39.800
Here's another view looking west

06:09:39.800 --> 06:09:42.200
from these luxury homes on the hill

06:09:42.240 --> 06:09:44.840
that will be transferred to Test and Unified.

06:09:44.840 --> 06:09:47.320
Petitioners have not included any of the homes

06:09:47.320 --> 06:09:50.640
behind these luxury houses in their petition for transfer.

06:09:50.640 --> 06:09:53.800
The school behind these homes, Jordan Elementary School,

06:09:53.800 --> 06:09:56.760
and the adjoining houses will remain in Orange Unified.

06:09:57.760 --> 06:10:00.240
It's clear from looking at these pictures

06:10:00.240 --> 06:10:03.240
that the petitioners excluded low-income homes

06:10:03.240 --> 06:10:05.280
from their proposed transfer.

06:10:05.280 --> 06:10:09.160
This will in fact exacerbate the socioeconomic disparities

06:10:09.160 --> 06:10:11.720
that already exist in the attendance area.

06:10:13.000 --> 06:10:15.760
Less than 20% of the students who reside

06:10:15.760 --> 06:10:17.200
in the proposed transfer area

06:10:17.200 --> 06:10:20.120
choose to attend Test and Unified schools.

06:10:20.120 --> 06:10:22.960
Students in Orange Unified already have the choice

06:10:22.960 --> 06:10:26.200
to attend Test and Unified through an existing robust

06:10:26.200 --> 06:10:28.760
inter-district transfer program.

06:10:28.760 --> 06:10:30.640
The idea that Orange Unified's

06:10:30.640 --> 06:10:33.960
inter-district transfer process is unduly burdensome

06:10:33.960 --> 06:10:35.440
is unsupported by the fact.

06:10:36.440 --> 06:10:40.120
Looking district-wide for the 2022-23 school year,

06:10:40.120 --> 06:10:43.720
there are 401 students attending Test and Unified

06:10:43.720 --> 06:10:46.320
on inter-district attendance permits granted

06:10:46.320 --> 06:10:48.240
by Orange Unified.

06:10:48.240 --> 06:10:50.960
Further, our process encourages applicants

06:10:50.960 --> 06:10:51.840
to visit our schools

06:10:51.840 --> 06:10:54.880
before they make a final decision to transfer.

06:10:54.880 --> 06:10:56.880
The transfer process in Orange Unified

06:10:56.880 --> 06:10:59.920
is similar to all those in our neighboring districts.

06:10:59.920 --> 06:11:02.640
We all have pride in our educational programs,

06:11:02.640 --> 06:11:04.360
and we would love for our residents

06:11:04.360 --> 06:11:06.680
to stay within our district.

06:11:06.680 --> 06:11:10.000
However, we don't force anybody to stay in our district.

06:11:11.040 --> 06:11:14.080
Focusing on just the proposed transfer area,

06:11:14.080 --> 06:11:18.040
there are currently 127 students residing there.

06:11:18.040 --> 06:11:22.960
105 of these students that represent 63 households,

06:11:22.960 --> 06:11:26.680
or 82.7% attend Orange Unified schools,

06:11:27.680 --> 06:11:32.240
and only 22 students that represent 15 households,

06:11:32.240 --> 06:11:36.840
or 17.3% choose to attend Test and Unified.

06:11:36.840 --> 06:11:39.400
It would be absolutely unreasonable

06:11:39.400 --> 06:11:43.120
to force the parents of 82.7% of the students

06:11:43.120 --> 06:11:45.040
in the proposed transfer area

06:11:45.040 --> 06:11:47.880
to seek transfers back into Orange Unified

06:11:47.880 --> 06:11:51.240
to attend the schools that they are currently attending.

06:11:51.240 --> 06:11:54.280
It's important to note that the 17.3%

06:11:54.280 --> 06:11:56.640
that currently have transfer permits

06:11:56.640 --> 06:11:58.320
did not seek those transfers

06:11:58.320 --> 06:12:01.080
because of dissatisfaction with educational programs

06:12:01.120 --> 06:12:02.520
or opportunities,

06:12:02.520 --> 06:12:05.240
but rather stated reasons are generally

06:12:05.240 --> 06:12:08.200
continuing enrollment, sibling enrollment,

06:12:08.200 --> 06:12:09.480
and parental employment.

06:12:10.600 --> 06:12:12.440
Like most districts in Orange County,

06:12:12.440 --> 06:12:15.160
Test and Unified is also in declining enrollment

06:12:15.160 --> 06:12:17.120
and is vigorously encouraging

06:12:17.120 --> 06:12:19.760
inter-district transfers to their school.

06:12:19.760 --> 06:12:22.160
Test and Unified has already posted instructions

06:12:22.160 --> 06:12:24.400
on their website for how to apply for permits

06:12:24.400 --> 06:12:25.920
to attend Test and Unified

06:12:25.920 --> 06:12:29.200
for the upcoming 23, 24th school year.

06:12:29.280 --> 06:12:33.960
So between our robust inter-district granting of permits

06:12:33.960 --> 06:12:37.080
and their desire for students from outside of the district,

06:12:37.080 --> 06:12:39.800
there's no problem for those who want to choose

06:12:39.800 --> 06:12:42.920
to go to Test and Unified from that area.

06:12:42.920 --> 06:12:47.480
There is no reason to transfer the entire property

06:12:47.480 --> 06:12:50.360
over there for just a few students.

06:12:51.360 --> 06:12:54.600
The forced transfer of half of the Panorama attendance area

06:12:54.600 --> 06:12:57.440
will result in a cut to teachers and staff

06:12:57.440 --> 06:12:59.760
and may lead to Panorama's closure,

06:12:59.760 --> 06:13:01.800
which by all accounts would be tragic

06:13:01.800 --> 06:13:06.240
as everyone agrees Panorama is a gym to the community.

06:13:06.240 --> 06:13:07.600
I thank you very much

06:13:07.600 --> 06:13:10.120
and I will now call on board member Anna Page.

06:13:12.840 --> 06:13:15.520
Good afternoon members of the State Board of Education

06:13:15.520 --> 06:13:17.640
and State Superintendent Thurman.

06:13:17.640 --> 06:13:19.200
I am board member Anna Page

06:13:19.200 --> 06:13:21.920
and I'm also a family and engagement,

06:13:21.920 --> 06:13:23.240
community engagement expert

06:13:23.240 --> 06:13:25.880
and a doctoral student in education.

06:13:25.880 --> 06:13:27.240
I am proud of our schools.

06:13:28.040 --> 06:13:30.320
Orange Unified Schools provide a fantastic education

06:13:30.320 --> 06:13:33.040
and I know firsthand from being a graduate of OUSD

06:13:33.040 --> 06:13:36.760
and also having my two young children in OUSD.

06:13:36.760 --> 06:13:39.680
This move to secede is all too common.

06:13:39.680 --> 06:13:41.520
It is happening all over the country.

06:13:41.520 --> 06:13:44.480
Numerous communities have seceded from their school districts

06:13:44.480 --> 06:13:47.360
and these communities involved were less diverse

06:13:47.360 --> 06:13:48.880
and had higher property values

06:13:48.880 --> 06:13:51.080
than those they left behind.

06:13:51.080 --> 06:13:54.080
This compounds socioeconomic inequalities

06:13:54.080 --> 06:13:56.280
that plague public schools.

06:13:56.280 --> 06:13:58.800
I'm very concerned that if the proposed transfer

06:13:58.800 --> 06:14:02.640
is approved that it will result in an even greater disparity

06:14:02.640 --> 06:14:06.360
of socioeconomic differences within the attendance area.

06:14:06.360 --> 06:14:07.880
The CDE acknowledges

06:14:07.880 --> 06:14:10.360
that some county committee members express concerns

06:14:10.360 --> 06:14:12.960
noting that the overall demographic disparity

06:14:12.960 --> 06:14:15.960
between the districts were a little troubling.

06:14:15.960 --> 06:14:19.160
Members further commented that the proposed transfer

06:14:19.160 --> 06:14:22.240
if approved probably would move those numbers

06:14:22.240 --> 06:14:23.520
in the wrong direction

06:14:23.560 --> 06:14:27.080
in reference to the racial and ethnic disparity.

06:14:27.080 --> 06:14:29.160
It is further troubling that the CDE

06:14:29.160 --> 06:14:31.680
only compared district-wide socioeconomic data

06:14:31.680 --> 06:14:33.040
between the two districts

06:14:33.040 --> 06:14:36.320
when the integrated education environment should be viewed

06:14:36.320 --> 06:14:38.960
comparing the six impacted schools.

06:14:38.960 --> 06:14:42.080
There's a marked difference in the socioeconomic data

06:14:42.080 --> 06:14:43.880
between these six schools.

06:14:43.880 --> 06:14:47.040
The three orange schools as depicted in the orange color

06:14:47.040 --> 06:14:50.120
serve a significant larger population of students

06:14:50.120 --> 06:14:51.560
who are English learners,

06:14:51.600 --> 06:14:53.560
receive free or reduced meals,

06:14:53.560 --> 06:14:56.040
and are generally socioeconomically disadvantaged

06:14:56.040 --> 06:14:57.960
compared to the three schools in testing

06:14:57.960 --> 06:14:59.960
as depicted in blue.

06:14:59.960 --> 06:15:03.440
In conclusion, the question is not necessarily intent,

06:15:03.440 --> 06:15:05.600
but the impact of this transfer.

06:15:05.600 --> 06:15:08.000
This transfer would exacerbate disparities

06:15:08.000 --> 06:15:11.440
and negative impacts of mental health

06:15:11.440 --> 06:15:14.520
in other students and proposed transfer area.

06:15:14.520 --> 06:15:17.680
This undermines diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts

06:15:17.680 --> 06:15:19.880
by Orange and the state board.

06:15:19.880 --> 06:15:22.840
The CDE makes no mention of these crucial impacts

06:15:22.840 --> 06:15:25.760
and is out of date and out of touch with reality.

06:15:25.760 --> 06:15:27.920
Thank you so much for your consideration.

06:15:33.240 --> 06:15:35.800
Hello, and good afternoon, state board members

06:15:35.800 --> 06:15:38.120
and state superintendent Thurmond.

06:15:38.120 --> 06:15:40.320
I'm Gumri Hansen, superintendent

06:15:40.320 --> 06:15:42.360
of Orange Unified School District,

06:15:42.360 --> 06:15:44.840
and I was previously the deputy superintendent

06:15:44.840 --> 06:15:46.800
of educational services.

06:15:46.800 --> 06:15:49.800
And I did meet with the two petitioners

06:15:50.720 --> 06:15:52.360
at that time in 2017,

06:15:52.360 --> 06:15:54.960
as well as again, when I became superintendent.

06:15:56.160 --> 06:15:59.440
There are conclusions that are made by the CDE

06:15:59.440 --> 06:16:01.400
that strongly support reasons

06:16:01.400 --> 06:16:04.800
why the transfer should not be approved.

06:16:04.800 --> 06:16:06.520
Unfortunately, the staff report

06:16:06.520 --> 06:16:09.040
defers to the county committee's decision,

06:16:09.040 --> 06:16:12.200
despite its numerous flaws and omissions.

06:16:12.200 --> 06:16:15.600
On page 15, the CDE staff report agrees

06:16:15.600 --> 06:16:17.600
with the academic quality assessments

06:16:17.600 --> 06:16:20.040
for the Orange Unified School District.

06:16:20.040 --> 06:16:21.440
And another reason for the denial

06:16:21.440 --> 06:16:23.280
is that the CDE acknowledges

06:16:23.280 --> 06:16:25.840
that the county committee took no formal action

06:16:25.840 --> 06:16:28.000
to identify the reasons for its approval

06:16:28.000 --> 06:16:30.320
or for the proposal.

06:16:30.320 --> 06:16:34.280
The CDE also found that the approval was quote,

06:16:34.280 --> 06:16:37.040
was prompted primarily by the county committee's

06:16:37.040 --> 06:16:39.080
determination that the petition

06:16:39.080 --> 06:16:41.840
had a greater sense of community identity

06:16:41.840 --> 06:16:44.120
with the test in Unified School District

06:16:44.120 --> 06:16:46.280
than with the Orange USD.

06:16:46.280 --> 06:16:48.080
The county committee decision was based

06:16:48.080 --> 06:16:51.560
on subjective beliefs of the petitioners

06:16:51.560 --> 06:16:54.760
rather than objective factors affecting the community.

06:16:55.680 --> 06:16:59.040
In fact, CDE found that none of the reasons

06:16:59.040 --> 06:17:02.760
offered by the petitioners made a compelling enough case

06:17:02.760 --> 06:17:05.240
to approve the proposed territory transfer

06:17:05.240 --> 06:17:06.880
because of the following issues.

06:17:06.880 --> 06:17:09.840
Number one, lack of consensus regarding

06:17:09.840 --> 06:17:12.760
the territory North Tustin comprises,

06:17:12.760 --> 06:17:15.160
which was discussed by Mr. Shirey.

06:17:15.160 --> 06:17:18.200
The fact that the additional North Tustin territory,

06:17:18.200 --> 06:17:21.440
and this is number two, would remain in Orange USD

06:17:21.440 --> 06:17:23.560
should the current proposal be approved.

06:17:23.560 --> 06:17:26.560
And number three, the long standing attendance

06:17:26.560 --> 06:17:30.800
from the proposed transfer area at OUSD schools.

06:17:30.800 --> 06:17:34.000
In all due respect, the CDE is incorrect

06:17:34.000 --> 06:17:37.120
and should not defer to the county committee's

06:17:37.120 --> 06:17:40.680
recommendations which apply an arbitrary standard

06:17:40.680 --> 06:17:43.200
that there must be a compelling reason

06:17:43.200 --> 06:17:45.280
to deny the proposed transfer.

06:17:45.280 --> 06:17:48.320
That erroneous standard does not comply

06:17:48.320 --> 06:17:53.320
with the education code or title five, section 18573.

06:17:53.560 --> 06:17:56.080
Again, the CDE is not a referee

06:17:56.080 --> 06:17:58.160
and this is not a sports match.

06:17:58.160 --> 06:18:01.240
The burden in fact falls on the petitioners

06:18:01.240 --> 06:18:05.160
to justify the merits of the proposed transfer of territory.

06:18:05.160 --> 06:18:09.280
Again, the proposed transfer will have a negative impact

06:18:09.280 --> 06:18:12.080
on Orange Unified educational programs.

06:18:12.080 --> 06:18:15.920
Any loss of students from, CDE opined that any loss

06:18:15.920 --> 06:18:18.840
of students from Panorama Elementary School

06:18:18.840 --> 06:18:22.480
would be gradual and occur over a period of time or years.

06:18:22.480 --> 06:18:24.680
This is purely speculative.

06:18:24.680 --> 06:18:28.040
There's no valid reason why Panorama Elementary.

06:18:28.040 --> 06:18:30.360
Your time is up, thank you.

06:18:30.360 --> 06:18:31.200
Thank you.

06:18:37.240 --> 06:18:39.840
At this point, we wanna open the phone lines

06:18:39.840 --> 06:18:41.400
for public comment.

06:18:43.080 --> 06:18:44.440
Somebody should mute.

06:18:45.840 --> 06:18:46.680
Thank you.

06:18:48.280 --> 06:18:51.000
We're gonna open the phone lines for public comment

06:18:51.000 --> 06:18:55.600
according to the slide that is now on the screen.

06:18:55.600 --> 06:18:57.840
Members of the public wishing to provide public comment

06:18:57.840 --> 06:19:00.440
can do so by calling that telephone number

06:19:00.440 --> 06:19:03.280
and using the access code provided on the slide.

06:19:03.280 --> 06:19:07.400
We remind you to turn down the volume of your computer

06:19:07.400 --> 06:19:09.320
if you're following the live feed.

06:19:09.320 --> 06:19:11.920
Speakers will be limited to one minute each.

06:19:12.760 --> 06:19:14.920
Are there any public comments?

06:19:14.920 --> 06:19:18.400
Yes, we have currently have 27 people in the queue.

06:19:18.400 --> 06:19:20.680
I will open the phone line now.

06:19:20.680 --> 06:19:21.520
Thank you.

06:19:22.400 --> 06:19:23.240
Good afternoon, caller.

06:19:23.240 --> 06:19:25.040
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:19:25.040 --> 06:19:25.880
You have one minute.

06:19:25.880 --> 06:19:26.880
Your time starts now.

06:19:32.080 --> 06:19:36.040
Caller with the last four digits, 3352, you are now live.

06:19:36.040 --> 06:19:37.640
Please start your public comment.

06:19:38.640 --> 06:19:41.040
Hi, my name is Tatiana Kuyumkin

06:19:41.040 --> 06:19:44.480
and I live in the neighborhood that is being considered

06:19:44.480 --> 06:19:46.920
to be rezoned to Tustin Unified School District

06:19:46.920 --> 06:19:50.960
and I do not consider myself a part of CUSD.

06:19:50.960 --> 06:19:53.640
I went through Orange USD since kindergarten

06:19:53.640 --> 06:19:55.960
along with my four younger siblings,

06:19:55.960 --> 06:19:59.600
two of which are attending Alvedina High School currently.

06:19:59.600 --> 06:20:03.400
I loved OUSD so much, I wanted to come back and teach here.

06:20:03.400 --> 06:20:05.400
So I'm now a middle school OUSD teacher

06:20:06.400 --> 06:20:08.840
at Santiago Charter Middle School.

06:20:08.840 --> 06:20:11.000
I do not agree with the rezoning of my neighborhood

06:20:11.000 --> 06:20:13.160
to Tustin because everyone who lives there

06:20:13.160 --> 06:20:16.080
and wants to continue to attend Orange Unified School

06:20:16.080 --> 06:20:19.840
will now have TUSD as their home school of residence.

06:20:19.840 --> 06:20:22.760
If parents want their child to attend Tustin Unified,

06:20:22.760 --> 06:20:23.760
I believe they can do so

06:20:23.760 --> 06:20:26.240
with the inter-district transfer form

06:20:26.240 --> 06:20:29.000
and instead not make everyone else have to apply

06:20:29.000 --> 06:20:33.360
to continue going to their current OUSD school.

06:20:33.360 --> 06:20:34.360
Thank you.

06:20:34.400 --> 06:20:35.320
Thank you.

06:20:35.320 --> 06:20:36.520
Next caller, please state your name

06:20:36.520 --> 06:20:37.720
and affiliation for the record.

06:20:37.720 --> 06:20:39.920
You have one minute, your time starts now.

06:20:43.560 --> 06:20:45.120
Yes, my name is Steve Lampman.

06:20:45.120 --> 06:20:46.240
I live in the area.

06:20:47.880 --> 06:20:49.400
My neighbors and I have endured

06:20:49.400 --> 06:20:51.120
an enormous amount of stress and anxiety

06:20:51.120 --> 06:20:53.720
at the annual inter-district transfer process.

06:20:53.720 --> 06:20:55.600
The process changed almost annually

06:20:55.600 --> 06:20:58.760
to include changing forms, increased denials,

06:20:58.760 --> 06:21:02.360
and recently the change in transfer application dates

06:21:02.360 --> 06:21:04.920
to miss a line and not even open

06:21:04.920 --> 06:21:08.640
until Tustin Unified transfer window closed.

06:21:08.640 --> 06:21:09.760
Like all students in the state,

06:21:09.760 --> 06:21:11.000
my twins have had a rough few years

06:21:11.000 --> 06:21:12.720
due to the pandemic and the stress

06:21:12.720 --> 06:21:14.480
of potentially having to leave

06:21:14.480 --> 06:21:16.640
the only schools and friends they've ever known,

06:21:16.640 --> 06:21:18.120
attend a school in a foreign community

06:21:18.120 --> 06:21:19.800
a great distance further away

06:21:19.800 --> 06:21:21.400
and or explore private school options

06:21:21.400 --> 06:21:24.200
has not been healthy for our kids or our families.

06:21:24.200 --> 06:21:26.720
As the board discussed earlier today's agenda,

06:21:26.720 --> 06:21:29.120
the social, emotional, wellbeing,

06:21:29.120 --> 06:21:31.400
and mental health of students in California

06:21:31.400 --> 06:21:32.760
is at a crucial point.

06:21:32.760 --> 06:21:34.160
COVID is trying to clear things.

06:21:34.160 --> 06:21:36.640
People need their community, stability,

06:21:36.640 --> 06:21:38.160
and belonging more than ever.

06:21:38.160 --> 06:21:39.080
Thank you.

06:21:39.080 --> 06:21:39.960

06:21:50.920 --> 06:21:53.960
Caller with the last four digits, 6059.

06:21:53.960 --> 06:21:54.800
You are now live.

06:21:54.800 --> 06:21:56.400
Please start your public comment.

06:21:59.080 --> 06:22:00.080
Good afternoon.

06:22:00.080 --> 06:22:02.680
I am Heather Irwin a teacher and parent

06:22:02.680 --> 06:22:05.840
of Orange Unified School District for over 20 years.

06:22:06.640 --> 06:22:09.760
I have taught at Panorama Elementary since 2010.

06:22:10.680 --> 06:22:13.440
All three of my delightful children are products

06:22:13.440 --> 06:22:14.840
of Panorama Elementary.

06:22:15.600 --> 06:22:17.880
Currently I have a freshman at El Medina,

06:22:18.520 --> 06:22:20.520
an eighth grader at Santiago,

06:22:20.520 --> 06:22:22.760
and a fourth grader here at Panorama.

06:22:23.480 --> 06:22:25.880
Although we choose to have our scholar athletes

06:22:25.880 --> 06:22:29.640
play multiple sports in custom including baseball,

06:22:29.680 --> 06:22:31.560
football, and cheerleading,

06:22:31.560 --> 06:22:34.880
our core community is the family connection

06:22:34.880 --> 06:22:36.720
we have made here at Panorama.

06:22:37.640 --> 06:22:40.440
These are the families who we rely on for carpools,

06:22:40.440 --> 06:22:42.400
babysitting, and social engagement.

06:22:43.120 --> 06:22:46.600
If this transfer occurs I will lose my community

06:22:47.120 --> 06:22:48.800
and thus would affect school pickups,

06:22:49.440 --> 06:22:51.040
after school activities,

06:22:51.040 --> 06:22:54.280
and loss of friends for both me as a parent

06:22:54.280 --> 06:22:55.280
and my children.

06:22:56.280 --> 06:23:00.880
And as a teacher I am terrified of this transfer.

06:23:01.560 --> 06:23:03.040
Class sizes would be smaller.

06:23:03.040 --> 06:23:05.400
Thus creating more combination classes.

06:23:05.400 --> 06:23:08.240
Thank you caller your time is up.

06:23:08.240 --> 06:23:09.360
Next caller please state your name

06:23:09.360 --> 06:23:10.600

06:23:21.520 --> 06:23:23.480
you are now live. Please start your public comment.

06:23:26.280 --> 06:23:28.240
Hi my name is Lana Tellman.

06:23:28.240 --> 06:23:30.800
I am a Panorama High president in favor

06:23:30.800 --> 06:23:33.560
of transferring area to to USD.

06:23:33.560 --> 06:23:35.800
Currently I have a lot of stress and uncertainty

06:23:35.800 --> 06:23:37.800
in knowing where my kids will be attending

06:23:37.800 --> 06:23:39.400
school in the future.

06:23:39.400 --> 06:23:41.400
Fact is my daughter attends elementary school

06:23:41.400 --> 06:23:44.320
currently at OUSD and none of her friends

06:23:44.320 --> 06:23:46.200
live in our community now.

06:23:46.200 --> 06:23:48.720
The children that live by us do attend to USD

06:23:48.720 --> 06:23:50.000
or are in private school.

06:23:50.520 --> 06:23:52.360
My daughter will finish the sixth grade

06:23:52.360 --> 06:23:53.800
due to my work schedule.

06:23:53.840 --> 06:23:56.520
I'm going to need to request a transfer so that her

06:23:56.520 --> 06:23:58.600
middle school and her high school will also

06:23:58.600 --> 06:24:00.280
be walking distance from our home.

06:24:00.880 --> 06:24:02.640
When that time comes I'm not even sure

06:24:02.640 --> 06:24:04.240
if my transfer would be approved.

06:24:04.960 --> 06:24:07.600
My son will start kindergarten next year

06:24:07.600 --> 06:24:10.000
and I will be requesting a transfer at that time.

06:24:10.000 --> 06:24:13.200
I don't want to risk uprooting my son in middle school too.

06:24:13.200 --> 06:24:15.480
He currently plays soccer with North Testen

06:24:15.480 --> 06:24:18.440
and my husband coached the team that plays over at Arroyo.

06:24:19.120 --> 06:24:21.960
So my family attends church kids sports

06:24:21.960 --> 06:24:24.960
and the kids friends live in this North Testen community

06:24:24.960 --> 06:24:27.200
and we'd be really grateful if our kids schools

06:24:27.200 --> 06:24:28.800
align with that as well.

06:24:28.800 --> 06:24:31.560
Well thankful for the CDE recommendations

06:24:31.560 --> 06:24:34.440
and we hope that you affirm as well.

06:24:34.440 --> 06:24:36.080
Thank you for your consideration.

06:24:36.080 --> 06:24:37.080
Thank you.

06:25:22.640 --> 06:25:24.640
Good afternoon.

06:25:24.640 --> 06:25:28.200
My name is Anthony Dang and calling in

06:25:28.200 --> 06:25:32.320
in petition for the fact that my family,

06:25:32.960 --> 06:25:35.200
our family just recently moved to the neighborhood

06:25:35.200 --> 06:25:39.360
in Paraguay because we fell in love with the community

06:25:39.360 --> 06:25:41.480
and that is so diverse and tight-knit.

06:25:42.680 --> 06:25:46.200
So we've been participate with a lot of things going on

06:25:46.200 --> 06:25:48.520
with the rest of North Testen neighborhood

06:25:49.200 --> 06:25:54.760
where we have soccer for my little daughter over Sundays

06:25:54.760 --> 06:25:58.360
and then my newborn son is going to get baptized

06:25:58.360 --> 06:26:02.000
in the church down the hill near Foothill High School here.

06:26:02.000 --> 06:26:03.440
So that's where we go to church.

06:26:04.520 --> 06:26:08.360
But then you know we often play they often play

06:26:08.360 --> 06:26:10.560
with each other as well as my neighborhood.

06:26:10.560 --> 06:26:14.640
Now we not knowing where we're going to be going for school

06:26:15.560 --> 06:26:18.480
and especially with the you know I'm listening

06:26:18.480 --> 06:26:23.680
to this whole thing about the inter transfer looks

06:26:23.680 --> 06:26:25.800
like we have to do it every single year

06:26:25.800 --> 06:26:28.640
if that's what we need to do for my kid to attend school.

06:26:28.640 --> 06:26:29.640
Thank you.

06:26:33.160 --> 06:26:34.360

06:27:23.000 --> 06:27:24.560
Good afternoon members of the board.

06:27:24.560 --> 06:27:27.720
I am Erin Roseli the principal at Panorama Elementary.

06:27:27.720 --> 06:27:29.520
I have been in Orange Unified School District

06:27:29.520 --> 06:27:32.120
almost my entire life first as a student

06:27:32.120 --> 06:27:35.240
then as a teacher at Panorama and now as the principal.

06:27:35.280 --> 06:27:37.640
I am extremely concerned about the negative impact

06:27:37.640 --> 06:27:39.800
this proposed transfer will have on the community

06:27:39.800 --> 06:27:41.520
of Panorama Elementary.

06:27:41.520 --> 06:27:44.400
At this time 53 of our current students reside within

06:27:44.400 --> 06:27:45.920
the impacted area.

06:27:45.920 --> 06:27:47.600
The loss of these students and the loss

06:27:47.600 --> 06:27:50.920
of the attendance area will substantially impact our school

06:27:50.920 --> 06:27:53.640
with the elimination of teachers staff funding

06:27:53.640 --> 06:27:55.280
and our programs offered.

06:27:55.280 --> 06:27:57.440
Additionally we currently have a very involved

06:27:57.440 --> 06:28:00.240
and active parent community to support our educational

06:28:00.240 --> 06:28:01.800
programs and activities.

06:28:01.800 --> 06:28:04.600
This significantly depletes the families at our school

06:28:04.600 --> 06:28:06.720
and impacts our Panorama community.

06:28:06.720 --> 06:28:08.640
During my time here our attendance area

06:28:08.640 --> 06:28:09.880
has already decreased.

06:28:09.880 --> 06:28:12.280
I'm concerned about the future of Panorama

06:28:12.280 --> 06:28:15.240
as its attendance area continues to be depleted.

06:28:15.240 --> 06:28:16.160
Thank you.

06:28:16.160 --> 06:28:17.080
Thank you.

06:28:17.080 --> 06:28:19.240
Next caller please state your name and affiliation

06:28:19.240 --> 06:28:20.080
for the record.

06:28:20.080 --> 06:28:22.000
You have one minute your time starts now.

06:28:27.240 --> 06:28:29.720
Caller with the last four digits 0 9 7 5

06:28:29.720 --> 06:28:30.560
you are now live.

06:28:30.560 --> 06:28:32.160
Please start your public comment.

06:28:33.160 --> 06:28:35.840
Yes my name is David Rivera.

06:28:35.840 --> 06:28:38.240
I'm the Deputy Superintendent for Orange Unified.

06:28:41.240 --> 06:28:44.880
The facts that, first of all Orange Unified

06:28:44.880 --> 06:28:47.360
is a very diverse school district

06:28:47.360 --> 06:28:50.000
within the Orange County area.

06:28:50.000 --> 06:28:54.720
The facts are incorrect and generalized

06:28:54.720 --> 06:28:58.120
with the data that was shared early in the presentation.

06:28:58.120 --> 06:29:01.360
18 of our schools have unduplicated accounts

06:29:01.360 --> 06:29:05.320
of 75% or higher and they're in the close proximity

06:29:05.320 --> 06:29:07.160
of the transfer area.

06:29:07.160 --> 06:29:11.400
23 of our schools are in the more affluent areas

06:29:11.400 --> 06:29:13.920
and they have a UPP of 25%

06:29:13.920 --> 06:29:16.440
but they're five to 10 miles away.

06:29:16.440 --> 06:29:18.800
For this reason with all due respect

06:29:18.800 --> 06:29:21.520
I'm challenging the representation as accurate.

06:29:22.400 --> 06:29:24.440
I disagree with the staff report

06:29:24.440 --> 06:29:27.960
that the transfer has minimal impact to OUSD.

06:29:27.960 --> 06:29:29.480
The district has already implemented

06:29:29.520 --> 06:29:31.680
$20 million of budget reductions

06:29:31.680 --> 06:29:34.000
as a result of enrollment decline.

06:29:34.000 --> 06:29:36.760
The impact of this decision will not only impact

06:29:36.760 --> 06:29:40.120
the Panorama community but it will also be felt

06:29:40.120 --> 06:29:40.960
across the district.

06:29:40.960 --> 06:29:43.000
Thank you caller.

06:29:43.000 --> 06:29:44.280
Next caller please state your name

06:29:44.280 --> 06:29:45.560
and affiliation for the record.

06:29:45.560 --> 06:29:47.680
You have one minute your time starts now.

06:29:52.360 --> 06:29:56.320
Caller with the last four digits 2233

06:29:56.320 --> 06:29:57.160
you are now live.

06:29:57.160 --> 06:29:58.720
Please start your public comment.

06:30:00.480 --> 06:30:01.800
Thank you.

06:30:01.800 --> 06:30:03.440
My name is Kathy Moffitt.

06:30:03.440 --> 06:30:06.480
I am a trustee of Orange Unified School District

06:30:06.480 --> 06:30:08.480
since 2001.

06:30:08.480 --> 06:30:11.920
I have also been a member of the Orange County Committee

06:30:11.920 --> 06:30:15.480
on School District Organization for six years.

06:30:15.480 --> 06:30:18.600
I want to repeat the testimony given by the petitioners

06:30:18.600 --> 06:30:22.280
that OUSD did not respond to their earlier attempts

06:30:22.280 --> 06:30:24.160
to contact us.

06:30:24.160 --> 06:30:26.960
As a board member I spent several hours one morning

06:30:26.960 --> 06:30:28.440
with all of the petitioners.

06:30:30.480 --> 06:30:32.720
I'm shocked that they don't remember that

06:30:32.720 --> 06:30:35.680
but it was an in-depth conversation.

06:30:35.680 --> 06:30:38.400
But I want to tell you today that my position is

06:30:38.400 --> 06:30:41.560
and it's a strong position that this petition

06:30:41.560 --> 06:30:44.640
must be denied for this very important reason.

06:30:44.640 --> 06:30:49.640
It seeks to segregate this small elite wealthy subset

06:30:50.160 --> 06:30:53.600
of the community from the larger community of culturally

06:30:53.600 --> 06:30:56.960
and economically diverse neighbors whose kids now

06:30:56.960 --> 06:31:00.840
all attend school together in Orange Unified.

06:31:00.840 --> 06:31:05.840
These, the vast majority of Panorama Heights students

06:31:06.040 --> 06:31:08.920
and their parents all have chosen

06:31:08.920 --> 06:31:12.120
to go to Panorama, Santiago.

06:31:12.120 --> 06:31:13.320
Next caller, please state your name

06:31:13.320 --> 06:31:14.640
and affiliation for the record.

06:31:14.640 --> 06:31:16.800
You have one minute, your time starts now.

06:31:22.400 --> 06:31:23.240
Caller with the last.

06:31:23.240 --> 06:31:25.840
Good afternoon members of the State Board of Education.

06:31:27.160 --> 06:31:29.320
Good afternoon members of the State Board of Education

06:31:29.320 --> 06:31:31.000
and State Superintendent Thurmond.

06:31:31.000 --> 06:31:33.320
My name is Eddie Angel, Executive Director

06:31:33.320 --> 06:31:36.400
of Student and Community Services for Orange Unified.

06:31:36.400 --> 06:31:38.280
The Orange Unified School District is committed

06:31:38.280 --> 06:31:41.520
to providing rigorous and engaging education

06:31:41.520 --> 06:31:43.920
to all students to lead them to college career

06:31:43.920 --> 06:31:45.440
and life readiness.

06:31:45.440 --> 06:31:48.080
Despite having a process in place for incoming

06:31:48.080 --> 06:31:51.280
and outgoing inter-district transfer requests

06:31:51.280 --> 06:31:53.080
similar to our neighboring districts,

06:31:53.080 --> 06:31:55.520
the Orange Unified School District works diligently

06:31:55.520 --> 06:31:57.480
to provide all students with a safe

06:31:57.480 --> 06:31:59.600
and equitable learning environment.

06:31:59.600 --> 06:32:01.720
After submitting their inter-district transfer request

06:32:01.720 --> 06:32:04.400
application, parents and our legal guardians

06:32:04.400 --> 06:32:06.840
are highly encouraged to meet with the school principal

06:32:06.840 --> 06:32:10.480
to allow our district to showcase our excellent programs.

06:32:10.480 --> 06:32:13.000
If a family should decide to move forward

06:32:13.000 --> 06:32:15.200
with their inter-district transfer request,

06:32:15.200 --> 06:32:16.800
the Office of Student Community Services

06:32:16.800 --> 06:32:19.440
will collaborate with the family on their request.

06:32:19.440 --> 06:32:20.400
Thank you.

06:32:20.400 --> 06:32:21.680
Thank you.

06:32:21.680 --> 06:32:22.920
Next caller, please state your name

06:32:22.920 --> 06:32:24.000
and affiliation for the record.

06:32:24.000 --> 06:32:24.840
We have one minute.

06:32:24.840 --> 06:32:25.680
Your time starts now.

06:32:30.360 --> 06:32:32.960
Caller with the last four digits, 4, 4, 6, 6.

06:32:32.960 --> 06:32:34.000
You are now live.

06:32:34.000 --> 06:32:35.600
Please start your public comment.

06:32:37.840 --> 06:32:38.680
Good afternoon.

06:32:38.680 --> 06:32:40.480
This is Kathleen Corrella.

06:32:40.480 --> 06:32:42.160
I am the Assistant Superintendent

06:32:42.160 --> 06:32:44.280
with Orange Unified School District.

06:32:44.280 --> 06:32:47.080
It is imperative to note that the rocking horse

06:32:47.080 --> 06:32:50.440
rich transfer bears no relevance to this proposed transfer

06:32:50.440 --> 06:32:53.440
and it is wholly distinguishable situation.

06:32:53.480 --> 06:32:55.960
CDE mentioned that in 2012,

06:32:55.960 --> 06:32:58.200
part of the rocking horse ridge subdivision

06:32:58.200 --> 06:33:00.160
was transferred from Orange to Tustin

06:33:00.160 --> 06:33:03.080
and only transferred 43 students.

06:33:03.080 --> 06:33:05.160
Rocking horse ridge was a newly developed,

06:33:05.160 --> 06:33:08.080
guard gated and self-contained subdivision.

06:33:08.080 --> 06:33:10.080
Both districts were neutral with the transfer

06:33:10.080 --> 06:33:12.200
of this small piece of territory.

06:33:12.200 --> 06:33:16.160
By contrast, this proposal would take 125 students

06:33:16.160 --> 06:33:18.320
and territory from Orange Unified

06:33:18.320 --> 06:33:20.680
that existed for over 60 years,

06:33:20.680 --> 06:33:22.880
forcing students out of one school district

06:33:22.960 --> 06:33:26.360
into another for what the CDE staff reports omit

06:33:26.360 --> 06:33:28.360
is no compelling reason.

06:33:28.360 --> 06:33:30.040
And for no compelling reason,

06:33:30.040 --> 06:33:33.480
less than 20% of the students in this proposed transfer

06:33:33.480 --> 06:33:35.920
will be allowed to dictate where over 80%

06:33:35.920 --> 06:33:37.600
of the students attend school.

06:33:37.600 --> 06:33:38.440
Thank you.

06:33:38.440 --> 06:33:39.720
Thank you.

06:33:39.720 --> 06:33:41.120
Next caller, please state your name

06:33:41.120 --> 06:33:42.200
and affiliation for the record.

06:33:42.200 --> 06:33:43.040
You have one minute.

06:33:43.040 --> 06:33:43.960
Your time starts now.

06:33:49.680 --> 06:33:51.120
Hi, my name is Sandy Davidson.

06:33:51.120 --> 06:33:52.520
I'm motivated to speak today

06:33:52.520 --> 06:33:55.720
as I feel very passionate about this issue.

06:33:55.720 --> 06:33:58.160
I'm a parent and an active community leader.

06:33:58.160 --> 06:34:01.720
I believe that if the petition is approved,

06:34:01.720 --> 06:34:04.040
it will have a huge impact on our community.

06:34:04.040 --> 06:34:06.240
All three of my children attended

06:34:06.240 --> 06:34:08.400
Orange Unified School District schools,

06:34:08.400 --> 06:34:11.120
Panorama, Santiago and El Medina.

06:34:11.120 --> 06:34:14.160
They had many friends from the affected area.

06:34:14.160 --> 06:34:15.880
They've grown up with these kids

06:34:15.880 --> 06:34:17.840
that they've played sports with

06:34:17.840 --> 06:34:19.640
and gone to Girl Scouts with,

06:34:19.640 --> 06:34:22.520
and they're continuing to get together today.

06:34:22.520 --> 06:34:24.160
So many entities will be impacted

06:34:24.160 --> 06:34:26.200
if this change is allowed to go through.

06:34:26.200 --> 06:34:29.160
OUSD revenue base will be eroded with the bond measure

06:34:29.160 --> 06:34:31.120
we passed to upgrade our schools,

06:34:31.120 --> 06:34:34.440
taking these high value homes out of the equation.

06:34:34.440 --> 06:34:36.520
Our Girl Scout Service Unit will be impacted

06:34:36.520 --> 06:34:38.520
as we have many members from this area

06:34:38.520 --> 06:34:42.360
and we are aligned with schools and a school district.

06:34:42.360 --> 06:34:43.880
Our Little League will be impacted

06:34:43.880 --> 06:34:45.440
as the boundaries for South Sunrise

06:34:45.440 --> 06:34:48.320
are aligned with a lower portion of our school district.

06:34:48.320 --> 06:34:51.400
That'll have a huge impact on that community.

06:34:51.400 --> 06:34:53.960
We've all been a part of this community together.

06:34:53.960 --> 06:34:56.400
It may also put our local elementary school,

06:34:56.400 --> 06:34:58.360
Panorama, at risk of losing.

06:34:58.360 --> 06:35:00.680
So there are many unintended consequences.

06:35:01.840 --> 06:35:03.120
Next caller, please state your name

06:35:03.120 --> 06:35:04.360
and affiliation for the record.

06:35:04.360 --> 06:35:06.520
You have one minute, your time starts now.

06:35:13.360 --> 06:35:16.440
Caller with the last four digits, 6261,

06:35:16.480 --> 06:35:17.320
you are now live.

06:35:17.320 --> 06:35:18.880
Please start your public comment.

06:35:29.080 --> 06:35:32.400
Caller with the last four digits, 1680,

06:35:32.400 --> 06:35:33.400
you are now live.

06:35:33.400 --> 06:35:35.120
Please start your public comment.

06:35:37.960 --> 06:35:39.360
My name is Christy Franco.

06:35:39.360 --> 06:35:41.880
I'm calling in opposition of the rezoning

06:35:41.880 --> 06:35:43.920
of Panorama Elementary School.

06:35:43.920 --> 06:35:46.840
In 2001, my husband and I purchased our home

06:35:46.840 --> 06:35:48.920
in Panorama Heights neighborhood,

06:35:48.920 --> 06:35:50.880
the exact neighborhood that's being considered

06:35:50.880 --> 06:35:54.280
for rezoning because it was in Orange Unified

06:35:54.280 --> 06:35:56.960
and it was .5 miles from Panorama.

06:35:56.960 --> 06:35:59.240
Our daughter and son both attended Panorama,

06:35:59.240 --> 06:36:01.480
went on to Santiago Charter Middle School

06:36:01.480 --> 06:36:03.320
and El Medina High School

06:36:03.320 --> 06:36:06.160
with their Panorama Elementary School friends.

06:36:06.160 --> 06:36:09.120
Both thrived academically, socially, and emotionally

06:36:09.120 --> 06:36:11.360
during their time in Orange Unified.

06:36:11.400 --> 06:36:14.160
Our daughter recently graduated from Gonzaga University

06:36:14.160 --> 06:36:16.960
and our son is a junior at Seattle Pacific University

06:36:16.960 --> 06:36:18.760
as a student athlete.

06:36:18.760 --> 06:36:21.160
Our children's current achievement began

06:36:21.160 --> 06:36:24.280
and are directly due to their academic origins

06:36:24.280 --> 06:36:26.880
at Panorama and continued academic

06:36:26.880 --> 06:36:30.480
and extracurricular opportunities in Orange Unified.

06:36:30.480 --> 06:36:32.680
It would be unfair for those who want to attend

06:36:32.680 --> 06:36:35.920
test in Unified to force my entire neighborhood

06:36:35.920 --> 06:36:37.160
to be rezoned.

06:36:37.160 --> 06:36:39.280
They have an option of doing so

06:36:39.280 --> 06:36:40.800
through inter-district transfer

06:36:41.240 --> 06:36:43.160
and if they want to attend tested,

06:36:43.160 --> 06:36:45.000
they could do it in that.

06:36:45.000 --> 06:36:45.840
Thank you.

06:36:46.840 --> 06:36:48.080
Next caller, please state your name

06:36:48.080 --> 06:36:49.320
and affiliation for the record.

06:36:49.320 --> 06:36:51.480
You have one minute, your time starts now.

06:36:57.240 --> 06:36:58.360
Good afternoon board members.

06:36:58.360 --> 06:37:01.760
My name is John Besta and my real job is retiree

06:37:01.760 --> 06:37:04.360
but in my spare time, I serve as the president

06:37:04.360 --> 06:37:06.800
of the Santiago Charter Middle School Board.

06:37:06.800 --> 06:37:08.480
I've had the pleasure of serving on the board

06:37:08.480 --> 06:37:11.600
of this wonderful school for the last five years.

06:37:11.600 --> 06:37:13.880
In addition to this, I've lived just one block

06:37:13.880 --> 06:37:17.040
from the area in question for the last 26 years.

06:37:17.040 --> 06:37:18.600
I'm very familiar with the schools

06:37:18.600 --> 06:37:20.000
on each side of the line.

06:37:20.000 --> 06:37:23.640
All of the schools we are discussing regarding this move

06:37:23.640 --> 06:37:27.160
are excellent and offer great opportunities for students.

06:37:27.160 --> 06:37:29.520
Speaking as the Santiago Board President,

06:37:29.520 --> 06:37:33.000
I'm against any change to the current district boundaries.

06:37:33.000 --> 06:37:33.960
Why?

06:37:33.960 --> 06:37:37.960
Because we are an independently operated charter school.

06:37:37.960 --> 06:37:40.720
The proposed change could cause a dramatic deficit

06:37:40.720 --> 06:37:42.600
to our operating budget.

06:37:42.600 --> 06:37:44.840
While it may be easier for Tustin and Orange Unified

06:37:44.840 --> 06:37:48.080
as large districts to bear the changes to enrollment,

06:37:48.080 --> 06:37:49.720
it's much more difficult for us

06:37:49.720 --> 06:37:52.440
and the school of 1100 to lose students.

06:37:52.440 --> 06:37:55.400
We could be looking at the loss of student programs,

06:37:55.400 --> 06:37:57.720
employees and operating budget.

06:37:57.720 --> 06:37:59.480
I recommend Panorama Heights neighborhood

06:37:59.480 --> 06:38:01.680
remain as part of the Orange Unified school district

06:38:01.680 --> 06:38:03.360
and no changes to be made.

06:38:03.360 --> 06:38:06.560
We already have a process of many times.

06:38:06.560 --> 06:38:07.400
Thank you, caller.

06:38:07.400 --> 06:38:08.240
Many times.

06:38:10.640 --> 06:38:11.920
Next caller, please state your name

06:38:11.920 --> 06:38:13.240
and affiliation for the record.

06:38:13.240 --> 06:38:14.200
Your time starts now.

06:38:14.200 --> 06:38:15.240
You have one minute.

06:38:18.400 --> 06:38:19.240
Good afternoon.

06:38:19.240 --> 06:38:20.840
My name is Dr. Jim D'Agostino.

06:38:20.840 --> 06:38:22.080
I am the Executive Director

06:38:22.080 --> 06:38:24.040
of Santiago Charter Middle School.

06:38:24.040 --> 06:38:25.360
Santiago is the middle school

06:38:25.360 --> 06:38:27.760
that the Panorama Heights neighborhood feeds into

06:38:27.760 --> 06:38:30.400
as part of Orange Unified's attendance area.

06:38:30.400 --> 06:38:32.680
Santiago currently has 17 students

06:38:32.680 --> 06:38:34.680
who reside in the Panorama Heights neighborhood

06:38:34.680 --> 06:38:36.320
and attend our school.

06:38:37.040 --> 06:38:39.360
In some years, that number is as high as 25 students.

06:38:39.360 --> 06:38:42.320
That's more than 2% of our student population.

06:38:42.320 --> 06:38:43.800
If the Panorama Heights neighborhood

06:38:43.800 --> 06:38:46.160
is rezoned to Tustin USD,

06:38:46.160 --> 06:38:47.760
it would require all of the parents

06:38:47.760 --> 06:38:49.120
who live in that neighborhood

06:38:49.120 --> 06:38:53.720
and selected their homes based on the attending OUSD schools

06:38:53.720 --> 06:38:56.200
to have to apply for an inter-district transfer

06:38:56.200 --> 06:38:58.800
to continue attending their home schools,

06:38:58.800 --> 06:39:01.520
which would create challenges for parents and students

06:39:01.520 --> 06:39:04.160
who simply want to stay in OUSD schools.

06:39:04.160 --> 06:39:06.160
This does not seem reasonable to me.

06:39:07.000 --> 06:39:08.720
I respectfully request that the State Board

06:39:08.720 --> 06:39:10.800
take action on this issue today

06:39:10.800 --> 06:39:13.760
and deny the transfer of the Panorama Heights neighborhood

06:39:13.760 --> 06:39:15.200
to Tustin USD.

06:39:15.200 --> 06:39:17.360
Thank you for your consideration on this matter.

06:39:17.360 --> 06:39:18.800
Thank you.

06:39:32.120 --> 06:39:32.960

Please start your public comment.

06:39:36.560 --> 06:39:38.200
My name is Claire Bridge.

06:39:38.200 --> 06:39:40.880
I'm the parent of a Panorama Heights resident

06:39:40.880 --> 06:39:42.840
and the grandparent of a kindergartner

06:39:42.840 --> 06:39:44.520
attending Arroyo Elementary

06:39:44.520 --> 06:39:46.520
in the Tustin Unified School District

06:39:46.520 --> 06:39:48.680
on an inter-district transfer.

06:39:48.680 --> 06:39:50.440
I urge the State Board of Education

06:39:50.440 --> 06:39:52.360
to uphold the California Department

06:39:52.360 --> 06:39:54.520
of Education recommendation

06:39:54.520 --> 06:39:56.840
and the County Committee approval of the proposal

06:39:56.840 --> 06:40:00.880
to transfer territory from the Orange Unified School District

06:40:00.880 --> 06:40:03.520
to the Tustin Unified School District.

06:40:03.520 --> 06:40:05.760
I'd like to add that I find it offensive

06:40:05.760 --> 06:40:08.880
to suggest that the motivation of these engaged

06:40:08.880 --> 06:40:12.480
and concerned parents is socioeconomically motivated.

06:40:12.480 --> 06:40:13.600
Thank you.

06:40:13.600 --> 06:40:15.000
Thank you.

Next caller, please state your name

06:40:23.280 --> 06:40:24.280
Thank you for your time today.

06:40:24.280 --> 06:40:25.640
My name is Ashley Pedroza

06:40:25.640 --> 06:40:27.120
and I serve as an administrator

06:40:27.120 --> 06:40:28.520
at Santiago Charter Middle School

06:40:28.520 --> 06:40:30.200
within the Orange Unified School District.

06:40:30.200 --> 06:40:31.360
I'm calling it opposition

06:40:31.360 --> 06:40:33.720
of rezoning the Panorama Heights community.

06:40:33.720 --> 06:40:34.920
Santiago Charter Middle School

06:40:34.960 --> 06:40:36.720
over the last five years has been recognized

06:40:36.720 --> 06:40:38.480
as a California democracy school,

06:40:38.480 --> 06:40:41.000
a P-21 exemplar school where WASCA credited

06:40:41.000 --> 06:40:43.800
and a California civic learning school of distinction.

06:40:43.800 --> 06:40:45.520
Many of these distinctions have been accompanied

06:40:45.520 --> 06:40:47.720
by visits from people across the state.

06:40:47.720 --> 06:40:49.400
The feedback from all of these committees

06:40:49.400 --> 06:40:52.440
is always Santiago and OUSD do an exemplary job

06:40:52.440 --> 06:40:54.520
of valuing diversity, inclusivity,

06:40:54.520 --> 06:40:58.080
and providing programs to students unseen anywhere else.

06:40:58.080 --> 06:41:01.520
Our programs and offerings would be dramatically different

06:41:01.520 --> 06:41:03.680
and depleted if the families of Panorama Heights

06:41:03.680 --> 06:41:05.400
were rezoned to test in Unified.

06:41:05.400 --> 06:41:07.680
These are and have always been Orange families

06:41:07.680 --> 06:41:09.880
and we are proud to be their school.

06:41:09.880 --> 06:41:10.760
Thank you.

06:41:10.760 --> 06:41:12.120
Thank you.

06:41:12.120 --> 06:41:13.240
Next caller, please state your name

06:41:13.240 --> 06:41:14.440
and affiliation for the record.

06:41:14.440 --> 06:41:15.280
You have one minute.

06:41:15.280 --> 06:41:16.200
Your time starts now.

06:41:24.880 --> 06:41:25.720
How are you?

06:41:25.720 --> 06:41:27.520
Hi, this is Joe Irvin, executive director.

06:41:28.960 --> 06:41:31.120
Hello, this is Joe Irvin, executive director

06:41:31.120 --> 06:41:32.360
of innovation and excellence

06:41:32.360 --> 06:41:35.080
with the Orange Unified School District.

06:41:35.080 --> 06:41:37.040
Public comment cards were reviewed.

06:41:37.040 --> 06:41:39.560
The comment cards sent to SBE email

06:41:39.560 --> 06:41:41.520
represent 48 individuals.

06:41:41.520 --> 06:41:42.680
Of those email comments,

06:41:42.680 --> 06:41:45.440
38 are verbatim cut and paste comments

06:41:45.440 --> 06:41:48.040
and individuals did not identify as parents

06:41:48.040 --> 06:41:50.320
of school age students in OUSD

06:41:50.320 --> 06:41:52.200
or test in Unified School District.

06:41:53.120 --> 06:41:55.440
These are residents in the proposed transfer area

06:41:55.440 --> 06:41:57.080
who have been asked to send in comments

06:41:57.080 --> 06:41:58.520
with a cut and paste email.

06:41:58.520 --> 06:42:02.120
Only four email comments were from OUSD families,

06:42:02.120 --> 06:42:05.320
three who support the transfer and one that does not.

06:42:05.320 --> 06:42:07.040
Four other email comments were from

06:42:07.040 --> 06:42:09.040
test in Unified School District parents

06:42:09.040 --> 06:42:10.800
who are in a district transfers approved

06:42:10.800 --> 06:42:13.080
by Orange Unified School District.

06:42:13.080 --> 06:42:15.120
This is significant as the majority of those

06:42:15.120 --> 06:42:17.800
who are commenting are not parents with children in schools

06:42:17.800 --> 06:42:19.760
but residents who have other motives.

06:42:19.760 --> 06:42:20.760
Thank you.

06:42:20.760 --> 06:42:21.640
Thank you.

06:42:21.640 --> 06:42:22.800
Next caller, please state your name

06:42:22.800 --> 06:42:23.960
and affiliation for the record.

06:42:23.960 --> 06:42:24.800
You have one minute.

06:42:24.800 --> 06:42:25.720
Your time starts now.

06:42:32.560 --> 06:42:34.840
Caller with the last four digits, six, two, six, one.

06:42:34.840 --> 06:42:35.680
You are now live.

06:42:35.680 --> 06:42:37.240
Please start your public comment.

06:42:44.160 --> 06:42:46.280
Moving on to the next caller.

06:42:46.280 --> 06:42:48.160
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:42:48.160 --> 06:42:49.000
You have one minute.

06:42:49.000 --> 06:42:50.040
Your time starts now.

06:43:03.120 --> 06:43:05.800
Caller with the last four digits, seven, two, zero, four.

06:43:05.800 --> 06:43:06.760
You are now live.

06:43:06.760 --> 06:43:08.200
Please start your public comment.

06:43:10.880 --> 06:43:12.760
My name is Sandra Presciato, Principal

06:43:12.760 --> 06:43:14.480
at Almedina High School.

06:43:14.480 --> 06:43:17.480
It is truly unfortunate that the Panorama territory

06:43:17.480 --> 06:43:20.320
transfer may be approved by SBE, creating greater

06:43:20.320 --> 06:43:23.040
disparity in racial and socioeconomic status

06:43:23.040 --> 06:43:25.040
at Panorama in Jordan Elementary,

06:43:25.040 --> 06:43:27.960
Santiago Middle School, and Almedina High School.

06:43:27.960 --> 06:43:30.240
The CDE mistakenly makes comparisons

06:43:30.240 --> 06:43:32.640
to district-wide data and not the impact

06:43:32.640 --> 06:43:34.560
in the attendance area, therefore stating

06:43:34.560 --> 06:43:37.360
the territory transfer is insignificant.

06:43:37.360 --> 06:43:41.080
The CDE and SBE may not be aware of the rich history

06:43:41.080 --> 06:43:44.000
of the Almedina community which fought for desegregation

06:43:44.000 --> 06:43:45.960
of schools in Orange County.

06:43:45.960 --> 06:43:48.000
This petition takes us backwards in the fight

06:43:48.000 --> 06:43:51.000
for equity and access and does not honor and nor uphold

06:43:51.000 --> 06:43:53.720
what plaintiff Lorenza Ramirez fought for in West

06:43:53.720 --> 06:43:55.640
Minister versus Board of Education case.

06:43:56.320 --> 06:43:59.440
Please do not approve the transfer of territory.

06:43:59.480 --> 06:44:02.080
None of the education code criteria for proposal

06:44:02.080 --> 06:44:05.680
was transfer was met and OC County committee

06:44:05.680 --> 06:44:08.120
made no findings because the petition was approved

06:44:08.120 --> 06:44:10.400
for reasons of personal identity preference

06:44:11.000 --> 06:44:13.360
of a limited number of families and not in the best

06:44:13.360 --> 06:44:16.120
interest of the edification process of our community.

06:44:16.120 --> 06:44:17.120
Thank you.

06:44:17.120 --> 06:44:18.120
Thank you.

06:44:19.000 --> 06:44:20.160
Next caller please state your name

06:44:20.160 --> 06:44:21.440
and affiliation for the record.

06:44:21.440 --> 06:44:23.040
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

06:44:23.040 --> 06:44:30.840
My name is Sue Guilford. I'm calling for OUSC.

06:44:30.840 --> 06:44:34.120
I've lived in Orange since 1976.

06:44:34.640 --> 06:44:38.440
Our sons graduated from Santiago and Santiago

06:44:38.440 --> 06:44:40.320
Middle School and Almedina High School.

06:44:40.320 --> 06:44:44.400
I was active with Boy Scouts PTA and Grad Night.

06:44:44.400 --> 06:44:46.880
I continue to watch the school board

06:44:46.880 --> 06:44:49.400
and the school district while I'm more active

06:44:49.400 --> 06:44:51.240
with legal women voters.

06:44:51.280 --> 06:44:53.720
I learned about this proposal from a friend

06:44:53.720 --> 06:44:55.320
who will be affected.

06:44:55.320 --> 06:44:58.680
My first thought was that this is about property values

06:44:58.680 --> 06:45:02.040
which since I've since learned that over 80 percent

06:45:02.040 --> 06:45:05.560
of the students in the area attend OUSC

06:45:05.560 --> 06:45:06.960
seems to be the case.

06:45:07.720 --> 06:45:10.880
Property value does not justify this change.

06:45:11.480 --> 06:45:14.320
Furthermore we have always valued the cultural

06:45:14.320 --> 06:45:18.440
diversity of our Orange Unified community

06:45:18.440 --> 06:45:22.360
and I'm concerned that this proposal could change

06:45:22.360 --> 06:45:24.880
that important and healthy feature.

06:45:24.880 --> 06:45:27.440
Please deny this petition. Thank you.

06:45:27.440 --> 06:45:28.440
Thank you.

06:45:29.240 --> 06:45:30.720
Next caller please state your name

06:45:30.720 --> 06:45:31.840
and affiliation for the record.

06:45:31.840 --> 06:45:33.320
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

06:45:40.080 --> 06:45:42.000
Hello. My name is Darshawn Smallwood

06:45:42.000 --> 06:45:43.720
and I come to you as a concerned citizen

06:45:43.720 --> 06:45:45.920
and a parent of three OUSC students.

06:45:45.920 --> 06:45:48.080
One who is currently at Almedina.

06:45:48.480 --> 06:45:50.360
We live adjacent to the area in question

06:45:50.360 --> 06:45:52.240
and also shop and have played sports

06:45:52.240 --> 06:45:54.040
and test and much like petitioners.

06:45:54.040 --> 06:45:56.200
I'm concerned by the petitioner's statement

06:45:56.200 --> 06:45:59.440
that they identify with TUSD and I have to wonder

06:45:59.440 --> 06:46:01.360
if it's because the demographics look a little bit

06:46:01.360 --> 06:46:02.560
more like their neighborhood.

06:46:03.320 --> 06:46:05.040
I noticed on the map that they didn't take

06:46:05.040 --> 06:46:07.480
the less affluent neighborhoods with them

06:46:07.480 --> 06:46:10.120
and you have to consider and ask yourself why.

06:46:10.120 --> 06:46:11.920
I think this is a terrible thing.

06:46:11.920 --> 06:46:14.000
I'm so grateful for my children's inclusive

06:46:14.000 --> 06:46:15.880
and diverse educational experience.

06:46:16.680 --> 06:46:17.360
One last thing.

06:46:17.360 --> 06:46:18.960
I see a lot of these numbers on how

06:46:18.960 --> 06:46:21.160
this is going to impact our district as a whole.

06:46:21.160 --> 06:46:23.520
However I think you need to think you need

06:46:23.520 --> 06:46:25.800
to know how this will impact our community

06:46:25.800 --> 06:46:28.000
specifically the three schools affected.

06:46:28.000 --> 06:46:30.680
Almedina is a school that I see on the precipice

06:46:30.680 --> 06:46:32.320
and we are losing affluent students

06:46:32.320 --> 06:46:34.160
before they even get to campus.

06:46:34.160 --> 06:46:35.720
This will exacerbate the problem.

06:46:35.720 --> 06:46:37.960
I ask I've asked that you allow all

06:46:37.960 --> 06:46:40.080
the Almedina area to vote on a transfer

06:46:40.080 --> 06:46:42.080
if you do choose to deny the petition.

06:46:43.040 --> 06:46:43.960
Thank you.

06:46:43.960 --> 06:46:45.160
Next caller please state your name

06:46:45.160 --> 06:46:46.320
and affiliation for the record.

06:46:46.320 --> 06:46:47.160
You have one minute.

06:46:47.160 --> 06:46:48.080
Your time starts now.

06:46:51.360 --> 06:46:53.200
Hi, my name is Lynn Marie Srediani.

06:46:53.200 --> 06:46:55.280
I'm a graduate of Orange Unified School District

06:46:55.280 --> 06:46:58.400
as well as a proud parent of four OUSD graduates.

06:46:58.400 --> 06:47:00.240
And even though my children have currently graduated

06:47:00.240 --> 06:47:02.040
I continue to be an active volunteer

06:47:02.040 --> 06:47:04.000
within the OUSD community.

06:47:04.000 --> 06:47:05.920
I attended the Orange County Department

06:47:05.920 --> 06:47:08.760
of Education County Committee meeting

06:47:08.760 --> 06:47:12.000
for school district reorganization hearing in 2017

06:47:12.000 --> 06:47:13.640
in order to speak about how this

06:47:13.680 --> 06:47:15.840
could create a segregated division.

06:47:15.840 --> 06:47:17.600
However, when I attended the meeting

06:47:17.600 --> 06:47:19.200
I was shocked by what I witnessed.

06:47:19.200 --> 06:47:21.320
I thought it would be a hearing where the voting members

06:47:21.320 --> 06:47:23.520
would be neutral parties listening to information

06:47:23.520 --> 06:47:25.440
regarding this potential transfer.

06:47:25.440 --> 06:47:27.880
Instead I saw links from the dais

06:47:27.880 --> 06:47:30.800
from then testing unified trustee Francine Cento

06:47:30.800 --> 06:47:33.320
directed at the petitioners after they spoke.

06:47:33.320 --> 06:47:34.960
It also appeared that other committee members

06:47:34.960 --> 06:47:37.800
were voting on issues that were voting on the issues

06:47:37.800 --> 06:47:39.400
were familiar with the petitioners.

06:47:39.400 --> 06:47:40.920
At the end of the meeting I then witnessed

06:47:40.920 --> 06:47:43.520
the committee members meeting with the petitioners

06:47:44.400 --> 06:47:46.680
out in the parking lot with one of the committee members

06:47:46.680 --> 06:47:48.600
even giving a petitioner a ride home

06:47:48.600 --> 06:47:50.080
because they both lived in the same

06:47:50.080 --> 06:47:52.520
North Tustin area neighborhood.

06:47:52.520 --> 06:47:53.360
This is not okay.

06:47:53.360 --> 06:47:56.840
This was not a fair or unbiased decision that was made.

06:47:56.840 --> 06:47:59.960
I ask you to please reverse the decision

06:47:59.960 --> 06:48:01.440
of taking Orange Unified's property

06:48:01.440 --> 06:48:03.280
and giving it to Tustin Unified.

06:48:03.280 --> 06:48:04.280
Thank you.

06:48:04.280 --> 06:48:05.120
Thank you.

06:48:05.120 --> 06:48:06.240
Next caller please state your name

06:48:06.240 --> 06:48:07.400
and affiliation for the record.

06:48:07.400 --> 06:48:09.560
You have one minute, your time starts now.

06:48:10.080 --> 06:48:14.280
Yes my name is Karen.

06:48:14.280 --> 06:48:19.280
I my kids attended Orange Unified elementary schools

06:48:19.320 --> 06:48:22.000
before my family moved overseas for a couple of years

06:48:22.000 --> 06:48:24.720
and upon return in 2013 my kids were ready

06:48:24.720 --> 06:48:26.840
to start seventh and ninth grade.

06:48:26.840 --> 06:48:29.680
I investigated both Tustin and Orange Unified schools

06:48:29.680 --> 06:48:32.480
as I live close to the border of the district.

06:48:32.480 --> 06:48:34.680
I called the Orange Unified district office

06:48:34.680 --> 06:48:37.240
to inquire about the inter district transfer process

06:48:37.240 --> 06:48:39.520
and it was explained to me so I knew I had the option

06:48:40.520 --> 06:48:42.440
of enrolling my kids in Tustin Unified.

06:48:42.440 --> 06:48:44.640
We visited El Medina, Santiago and Orange

06:48:44.640 --> 06:48:46.000
and Foothill and Hughes in Tustin

06:48:46.000 --> 06:48:48.080
and decided to stay in Orange.

06:48:48.080 --> 06:48:50.640
Both my girls will be graduating from college this summer.

06:48:50.640 --> 06:48:53.320
My oldest already holds a civil engineering degree

06:48:53.320 --> 06:48:55.240
from UCLA and hopes to get her master's

06:48:55.240 --> 06:48:57.200
in coastal engineering in June.

06:48:57.200 --> 06:48:59.400
And my youngest will receive her bachelor of science

06:48:59.400 --> 06:49:02.400
degree from Cal State Maritime Academy.

06:49:02.400 --> 06:49:04.240
And I want to thank Orange Unified schools

06:49:04.240 --> 06:49:07.200
for all the opportunities that set them up for success

06:49:07.200 --> 06:49:08.440
and I'm happy with the decision

06:49:08.440 --> 06:49:10.960
that we stayed in Orange Unified.

06:49:10.960 --> 06:49:12.960
But it's good to know there's options

06:49:12.960 --> 06:49:17.480
and inter district transfers are available for everybody.

06:49:17.480 --> 06:49:21.480
So thank you and please refer the decision.

06:49:21.480 --> 06:49:22.680
Thank you.

06:49:22.680 --> 06:49:23.840
Next caller, please state your name

06:49:34.600 --> 06:49:37.040

06:49:37.080 --> 06:49:37.920

Please start your public comment.

06:49:41.880 --> 06:49:43.720
Hi, my name's Angela Casaza-Stanfield.

06:49:43.720 --> 06:49:45.920
I am a librarian at Panorama Elementary.

06:49:45.920 --> 06:49:49.520
Additionally, I am a parent of a Panorama third grader

06:49:49.520 --> 06:49:51.800
and eighth grader at Santiago Middle School.

06:49:51.800 --> 06:49:53.800
I would like to say as a parent in this community,

06:49:53.800 --> 06:49:57.720
I choose to send my children to Panorama and Santiago.

06:49:57.720 --> 06:50:00.160
I am concerned about the impact this transfer would have

06:50:00.160 --> 06:50:02.520
on the schools, teachers and programs offered.

06:50:03.400 --> 06:50:07.400
I am also concerned that a decrease in student enrollment

06:50:07.400 --> 06:50:08.960
would lead to teachers losing their jobs

06:50:08.960 --> 06:50:12.800
and the programs being removed from Panorama and Santiago.

06:50:12.800 --> 06:50:13.640
Thank you.

06:50:15.640 --> 06:50:16.680
Thank you.

06:50:36.200 --> 06:50:37.040
Hi, thank you.

06:50:37.040 --> 06:50:38.760
My name's Steve Allman.

06:50:38.760 --> 06:50:41.560
I'm a long-term resident of City of Orange.

06:50:41.560 --> 06:50:43.760
My family moved here in 1970.

06:50:43.760 --> 06:50:45.960
I've had a long relationship

06:50:45.960 --> 06:50:47.600
with the Orange Unified School District

06:50:47.600 --> 06:50:51.080
as a student, a parent and a community member.

06:50:51.080 --> 06:50:53.960
I also graduated from El Medina High School.

06:50:53.960 --> 06:50:56.620
I've also been a realtor working in the community

06:50:56.620 --> 06:50:57.960
for the last 10 years

06:50:57.960 --> 06:51:01.600
and I've closely followed the petition for several years.

06:51:02.760 --> 06:51:06.160
I know for a fact that there are realtors

06:51:06.160 --> 06:51:10.360
who are highly motivated in having this petition pass

06:51:10.360 --> 06:51:13.920
and they have been aggressively communicating

06:51:13.920 --> 06:51:16.560
to the homeowners that its passage

06:51:16.560 --> 06:51:19.720
will result in increased property values.

06:51:19.720 --> 06:51:23.560
Let's be clear, this has nothing to do with the children.

06:51:23.560 --> 06:51:26.400
It's all about the main purpose of this petition

06:51:26.400 --> 06:51:31.400
is to raise the value of the personal properties

06:51:31.400 --> 06:51:33.240
of the homeowners in that community.

06:51:35.360 --> 06:51:36.200
Thank you.

06:51:36.200 --> 06:51:37.400
Next caller, please state your name

06:51:37.400 --> 06:51:38.600
and affiliation for the record.

06:51:38.600 --> 06:51:39.440
You have one minute.

06:51:39.440 --> 06:51:40.400
Your time starts now.

06:51:44.040 --> 06:51:46.320
Hello, my name is Liz Bridge.

06:51:46.320 --> 06:51:48.280
I'm a resident of North Tustin

06:51:48.280 --> 06:51:51.080
and a mother of two school-aged children.

06:51:51.080 --> 06:51:53.220
I'm calling to petition for the approval

06:51:53.220 --> 06:51:57.000
to transfer territory from the Orange Unified School District

06:51:57.000 --> 06:51:59.660
to the Tustin Unified School District.

06:51:59.660 --> 06:52:01.660
There is a reason that the locals consider

06:52:01.660 --> 06:52:03.380
our neighborhood as North Tustin.

06:52:03.980 --> 06:52:06.460
For many years Panorama Heights has been a part

06:52:06.460 --> 06:52:07.580
of the Tustin community.

06:52:08.220 --> 06:52:10.460
When my children are asked where they are from

06:52:11.020 --> 06:52:13.580
they reply with Tustin not Orange.

06:52:13.580 --> 06:52:16.060
Our neighborhood shares the same zip code

06:52:16.060 --> 06:52:17.820
with the greater part of North Tustin.

06:52:18.340 --> 06:52:20.860
Our home is at the drawing line of the two districts.

06:52:21.460 --> 06:52:23.540
Our neighbors across the street are a part

06:52:23.540 --> 06:52:25.460
of Tustin Unified School District.

06:52:26.100 --> 06:52:28.180
We can even hear the school bells ring

06:52:28.220 --> 06:52:30.220
from the two Tustin schools right down

06:52:30.220 --> 06:52:31.300
the street from our homes.

06:52:31.860 --> 06:52:34.020
We just wish to be granted the liberty

06:52:34.020 --> 06:52:36.540
of attending the school we feel that we belong

06:52:36.540 --> 06:52:38.980
in without having to go through obstacles

06:52:38.980 --> 06:52:41.460
in order for Orange Unified to release us.

06:52:42.140 --> 06:52:44.780
Orange Unified states that they don't force anyone

06:52:44.780 --> 06:52:46.140
to stay within their school.

06:52:46.140 --> 06:52:46.660
Thank you.

06:52:46.660 --> 06:52:48.420
Yet they make it extremely difficult

06:52:48.420 --> 06:52:49.860
to obtain a permit.

06:52:51.100 --> 06:52:52.380

Hi my name is Brian Alcarez.

06:53:13.060 --> 06:53:17.780
I'm a homeowner that lives on 12282 Manuta Panorama.

06:53:18.340 --> 06:53:20.740
The reason for my statement today is for the concern

06:53:20.740 --> 06:53:23.780
regarding the school district location for our two kids.

06:53:23.780 --> 06:53:26.580
We have lived in North Tustin for the past 12 years

06:53:27.100 --> 06:53:29.420
and all of our activities American Youth Soccer

06:53:29.420 --> 06:53:34.220
Association SoCal Swim and Tustin Western Little League

06:53:34.220 --> 06:53:36.620
have been in and close to the Tustin locations.

06:53:37.260 --> 06:53:39.700
This is the area in which my kids are comfortable

06:53:39.700 --> 06:53:42.460
where we feel the closest to and where their friends

06:53:42.460 --> 06:53:44.980
will be going to school either Foothill or Hughes.

06:53:45.540 --> 06:53:48.780
At the end of the day I just want the best for our kids.

06:53:48.780 --> 06:53:51.420
We would appreciate your consideration in this matter.

06:53:51.940 --> 06:53:54.940
I'm extremely happy that the California Department

06:53:54.940 --> 06:53:57.420
of Education recommends to affirm the transfer

06:53:57.420 --> 06:54:00.780
from OUSD to TUSD. Thank you.

06:54:01.300 --> 06:54:03.580
Thank you. Next caller please state your name

06:54:03.580 --> 06:54:05.340

06:54:05.340 --> 06:54:06.940

Please start your public comment.

06:54:20.860 --> 06:54:23.820
Good afternoon I'm Carl Cohn Professor Emeritus

06:54:23.820 --> 06:54:27.180
and Senior Research Fellow at Claremont Graduate University.

06:54:27.180 --> 06:54:30.380
I'm very concerned about the CDE recommendation

06:54:30.380 --> 06:54:32.620
to the state board on this matter.

06:54:32.620 --> 06:54:37.260
As you wade through the 30 plus pages of Attachment 1 analysis

06:54:37.260 --> 06:54:41.500
of the administrative record the CDE seems to be saying

06:54:41.500 --> 06:54:44.940
that even though they don't find the petitioners reasons

06:54:44.940 --> 06:54:47.980
compelling enough to support the transfer

06:54:47.980 --> 06:54:54.620
the department is recommending approval out of deference

06:54:54.620 --> 06:54:56.220
to local control.

06:54:56.220 --> 06:54:59.660
I do not think this is the type of message that the CDE

06:54:59.660 --> 06:55:02.460
or the state board should be sending at a time

06:55:02.460 --> 06:55:05.100
when many districts in the state are experiencing

06:55:05.100 --> 06:55:06.620
declining enrollment.

06:55:06.620 --> 06:55:10.700
I'm a huge fan of local control under the right circumstances

06:55:10.700 --> 06:55:13.100
having served on the state board during the launch

06:55:13.100 --> 06:55:15.740
of Governor Brown's historic initiative.

06:55:15.740 --> 06:55:19.820
Given how circumstances have changed in the intervening years

06:55:19.820 --> 06:55:22.460
I do not think this is the right message

06:55:22.460 --> 06:55:25.180
for state leadership to send at this time.

06:55:25.180 --> 06:55:25.580
Thank you.

06:55:26.540 --> 06:55:27.020
Thank you.

06:55:27.820 --> 06:55:29.820

06:55:46.460 --> 06:55:49.340
Hi my name is Maureen Better.

06:55:49.340 --> 06:55:52.300
I've lived up on Panorama Hill for a number of years.

06:55:52.300 --> 06:55:55.740
My kids were transferred to Hughes and Foothill

06:55:55.740 --> 06:55:57.180
but the transfers were not easy.

06:55:57.180 --> 06:55:59.420
Each year the rules change depending on whether

06:55:59.420 --> 06:56:03.180
the schools are impacted grades correct them etc.

06:56:03.180 --> 06:56:06.460
And many of the other neighbors that are up here

06:56:06.460 --> 06:56:09.420
on Panorama are unsuccessful getting transferred

06:56:09.420 --> 06:56:12.380
which is probably why you're showing the low percentage

06:56:12.380 --> 06:56:13.980
rate of 20 percent.

06:56:13.980 --> 06:56:16.380
And finally I want to make a note that this hill

06:56:16.380 --> 06:56:19.900
is a mountain you there's only one way in one way out

06:56:19.900 --> 06:56:21.740
you get down the mountain and across the street

06:56:21.740 --> 06:56:24.780
is Tustin the Tustin school homes.

06:56:25.340 --> 06:56:27.740
Those are the homes where my friends live

06:56:28.540 --> 06:56:30.940
and their kids go to school at Tustin.

06:56:31.500 --> 06:56:34.060
In order to get over to the other area of Orange

06:56:34.060 --> 06:56:37.260
you have to cross a busy street busy Chapman.

06:56:37.260 --> 06:56:39.420
And the other point I wanted to mention real quick

06:56:39.420 --> 06:56:42.060
is that saying that at the bottom of the hill

06:56:42.060 --> 06:56:44.060
they're not affluent neighborhoods.

06:56:44.060 --> 06:56:46.140
Those are in Orange it's just a cut off

06:56:46.140 --> 06:56:49.100
it's not part of the transfer there they are the city of Orange.

06:56:50.140 --> 06:56:51.980
Next caller please state your name and affiliation

06:56:51.980 --> 06:56:54.140
for the record you have one minute your time starts now.

06:56:58.860 --> 06:57:04.780
Yes I do want to emphasize that there's a lot of OUSD

06:57:04.780 --> 06:57:07.660
and the public interest are the people that do live on this hill.

06:57:09.180 --> 06:57:11.420
I'm a 22 year resident of Panorama Heights

06:57:11.500 --> 06:57:14.460
there's not a lot of homes that sell around this area

06:57:14.460 --> 06:57:17.580
because it is a gem and I am a mother of four children.

06:57:17.580 --> 06:57:19.900
My two oldest children attended Foothill High School

06:57:19.900 --> 06:57:21.500
and Tustin Unified School District

06:57:21.500 --> 06:57:23.740
on a transfer petition from Orange Unified.

06:57:23.740 --> 06:57:27.260
Our decision to request this transfer was due to the proximity

06:57:27.260 --> 06:57:30.780
of Foothill to our home which was only a half mile away

06:57:30.780 --> 06:57:33.500
which was the safe walking distance from the school

06:57:33.500 --> 06:57:35.500
and a practical choice for my two children

06:57:36.460 --> 06:57:38.860
and who had working parents

06:57:38.940 --> 06:57:41.020
and are deeper to Tyson North Tustin.

06:57:41.020 --> 06:57:42.940
We're an integral part of this community.

06:57:42.940 --> 06:57:45.020
I have a child with cancer now

06:57:45.020 --> 06:57:48.700
that I have had to send to a private school

06:57:48.700 --> 06:57:51.020
because of the anxiety that I've had to feel

06:57:51.580 --> 06:57:55.100
and to transfer them to from Orange

06:57:55.100 --> 06:57:58.060
and Orange every year has told me it is not guaranteed.

06:57:58.060 --> 06:58:02.060
I want my children to attend schools in Tustin Unified.

06:58:02.060 --> 06:58:02.860
Thank you so much.

06:58:05.020 --> 06:58:06.300

06:58:13.580 --> 06:58:15.100
Hi my name is Jennifer Burecki

06:58:15.100 --> 06:58:17.180
and I am a resident of the affected area

06:58:17.180 --> 06:58:19.020
and I am for affirming the approval.

06:58:19.020 --> 06:58:21.740
I myself am an alumna of Houston Foothill

06:58:21.740 --> 06:58:23.100
and my husband and I moved back here

06:58:23.100 --> 06:58:25.420
we wanted our son to have the same experience.

06:58:25.420 --> 06:58:27.900
There is so much diversity of activities and experiences

06:58:27.900 --> 06:58:29.580
and I'm so appreciative of that elevation

06:58:29.580 --> 06:58:32.300
that allowed me to be fortunate enough to move back here.

06:58:32.300 --> 06:58:34.460
My son is already entrenched in Tustin

06:58:34.460 --> 06:58:37.260
extracurricular activities, swim class, music class, library

06:58:37.260 --> 06:58:39.020
every Saturday for story time

06:58:39.020 --> 06:58:40.620
and by the time he enters kindergarten

06:58:40.620 --> 06:58:42.700
he will have five years of this community

06:58:42.700 --> 06:58:45.500
with kids that are going to Tustin Unified school districts.

06:58:45.500 --> 06:58:47.100
The stress and anxiety that we've heard

06:58:47.100 --> 06:58:49.100
over interest or transfers is not something

06:58:49.100 --> 06:58:50.620
that I'm looking forward to.

06:58:50.620 --> 06:58:52.140
Every single night we walk our neighborhood

06:58:52.140 --> 06:58:53.820
and there's a spot on our hill which you can see

06:58:53.820 --> 06:58:55.340
Foothill and Hughes campuses.

06:58:55.340 --> 06:58:58.060
We always say how grateful we are to live in North Tustin

06:58:58.060 --> 06:59:00.220
and we'd love our address to match our school district

06:59:00.220 --> 06:59:03.260
as the residents that live in the affected area today

06:59:03.260 --> 06:59:05.900
have said versus the employees of OUSD

06:59:05.900 --> 06:59:07.980
that are here on the call today

06:59:07.980 --> 06:59:10.460
or do not have children affected by this decision.

06:59:10.460 --> 06:59:12.380
My family lives a couple blocks away.

06:59:12.380 --> 06:59:15.580
They are in the TUSD and I see my neighbors

06:59:15.580 --> 06:59:16.780
with their kids walking to school

06:59:16.780 --> 06:59:17.820
and I want that for my son.

06:59:21.820 --> 06:59:22.940
Next caller please state your name

06:59:22.940 --> 06:59:24.380
and affiliation for the record.

06:59:24.380 --> 06:59:25.260
Your time starts now.

06:59:25.260 --> 06:59:25.980
You have one minute.

06:59:31.260 --> 06:59:32.060
Hi, how's it going?

06:59:32.060 --> 06:59:33.500
This is Casey Bowden.

06:59:33.500 --> 06:59:36.060
I'm a resident of North Tustin.

06:59:36.060 --> 06:59:39.260
I have children right now that are attending Panorama

06:59:39.260 --> 06:59:43.500
and we are pro the transfer of territory.

06:59:43.500 --> 06:59:45.740
So just a couple comments here.

06:59:45.740 --> 06:59:48.540
The the unfounded comments on the restricted

06:59:48.540 --> 06:59:51.500
or limited funding to the Orange Unified Schools.

06:59:51.500 --> 06:59:52.620
People are just saying that.

06:59:52.620 --> 06:59:54.140
That's not what was actually founded

06:59:54.140 --> 06:59:55.660
when people did the research on this.

06:59:56.300 --> 06:59:57.980
The original school district boundary lines

06:59:57.980 --> 07:00:00.140
were drawn in 1953.

07:00:00.220 --> 07:00:03.420
Tustin is a newer school district that was open in 72

07:00:04.140 --> 07:00:06.220
as the area was developed and grown up.

07:00:07.340 --> 07:00:08.700
I think we have to let the people

07:00:08.700 --> 07:00:10.620
who are directly impacted be heard.

07:00:10.620 --> 07:00:12.540
It's really cool that Orange Unified

07:00:12.540 --> 07:00:14.460
has a great arm and a lot of contacts

07:00:14.460 --> 07:00:16.060
that they could get people to call in

07:00:16.060 --> 07:00:17.980
but you guys aren't going to be directly impacted.

07:00:17.980 --> 07:00:20.860
This is a Panorama Heights neighborhood

07:00:20.860 --> 07:00:23.500
that we're looking to get relocated to North Tustin

07:00:23.500 --> 07:00:26.380
so that we can align with our communities.

07:00:26.380 --> 07:00:27.420
My kids go to swim.

07:00:27.420 --> 07:00:28.300
We go to soccer.

07:00:29.020 --> 07:00:31.820
All of these great organizations all in Tustin.

07:00:31.820 --> 07:00:34.620
We want to be reunited with our friends, our churches,

07:00:34.620 --> 07:00:36.380
Foothill Community Association,

07:00:36.380 --> 07:00:38.140
boundaries affect us as well.

07:00:38.140 --> 07:00:39.100
Thank you very much.

07:00:39.100 --> 07:00:40.300
Please approve the transfer.

07:00:41.260 --> 07:00:42.060
Next caller.

07:00:42.060 --> 07:00:43.820
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

07:00:43.820 --> 07:00:44.460
You have one minute.

07:00:44.460 --> 07:00:45.420
Your time starts now.

07:00:49.180 --> 07:00:49.660
Hello.

07:00:49.660 --> 07:00:51.260
My name is Karen Adams.

07:00:51.260 --> 07:00:54.460
I am the parent of one current OUSD student

07:00:54.460 --> 07:00:56.220
and one recent graduate.

07:00:56.220 --> 07:00:57.900
I live in Orange Park Acres,

07:00:57.900 --> 07:01:00.460
which is part of Orange Unified

07:01:00.460 --> 07:01:02.380
and next to the area in question.

07:01:02.940 --> 07:01:04.780
We share many of the same traits

07:01:04.780 --> 07:01:07.580
as we both are part of unincorporated areas

07:01:07.580 --> 07:01:10.620
and are served by county sheriffs, EMS,

07:01:10.620 --> 07:01:11.740
and various utilities.

07:01:12.380 --> 07:01:15.100
Unlike the general area outlined by the petitioners,

07:01:15.100 --> 07:01:17.260
we are an actual designated community

07:01:17.260 --> 07:01:20.060
with a general plan and a specific identity

07:01:20.060 --> 07:01:21.820
as an equestrian community.

07:01:22.540 --> 07:01:25.180
My concern is that if the Panorama Heights area

07:01:25.180 --> 07:01:27.340
is allowed to leave Orange Unified,

07:01:27.340 --> 07:01:30.140
they will only be the first of the affluent areas

07:01:30.140 --> 07:01:31.260
adjacent to follow.

07:01:31.900 --> 07:01:34.780
Orange Park Acres would likely be second.

07:01:34.780 --> 07:01:37.900
To avoid a slippery slope of affluent areas

07:01:37.900 --> 07:01:41.180
leaving OUSD, you should deny petitioners' request.

07:01:44.380 --> 07:01:45.180
Thank you.

07:01:45.180 --> 07:01:45.820
Next caller.

07:01:45.820 --> 07:01:47.580
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

07:01:47.580 --> 07:01:48.220
You have one minute.

07:01:48.220 --> 07:01:49.180
Your time starts now.

07:01:53.660 --> 07:01:55.020
My name is Lisa Adre.

07:01:55.020 --> 07:01:57.260
And I am currently serving on the Santiago Charter

07:01:57.260 --> 07:01:58.540
Board of Directors.

07:01:58.540 --> 07:02:00.860
Our board is against the rezoning of the area

07:02:00.860 --> 07:02:02.060
known as Panorama Heights

07:02:02.060 --> 07:02:04.140
to the Tustin Unified School District.

07:02:04.140 --> 07:02:05.820
We currently have 17 students

07:02:05.820 --> 07:02:07.420
who live in the Panorama Heights area

07:02:07.420 --> 07:02:08.860
that attend our school.

07:02:08.860 --> 07:02:10.620
These students and their families are happy

07:02:10.620 --> 07:02:12.300
and thriving at Santiago.

07:02:12.300 --> 07:02:15.500
If they were rezoned and required to attend Tustin USD,

07:02:15.500 --> 07:02:17.340
that would force them to leave their classmates,

07:02:17.340 --> 07:02:19.740
current programs, and be uprooted educationally.

07:02:20.300 --> 07:02:23.020
This would also have a negative fiscal impact on Santiago

07:02:23.100 --> 07:02:24.780
as we would be looking at approximately

07:02:24.780 --> 07:02:26.940
180,000 reduction in budget,

07:02:26.940 --> 07:02:30.060
which would result in Santiago having to reduce our staff

07:02:30.060 --> 07:02:33.020
by two full-time teachers and or slash programs.

07:02:33.020 --> 07:02:35.420
The students who currently live in the Panorama Heights area

07:02:35.420 --> 07:02:38.460
have an option to attend Tustin Unified if they so choose.

07:02:38.460 --> 07:02:40.860
But rezoning everyone would cause undue challenges

07:02:40.860 --> 07:02:42.940
on many families and the schools involved.

07:02:42.940 --> 07:02:45.340
The Santiago Charter Board requests that the State Board

07:02:45.340 --> 07:02:47.500
of Education deny the request for the rezoning

07:02:47.500 --> 07:02:51.100
of the Panorama Heights area to Tustin Unified School District.

07:02:51.100 --> 07:02:51.820
Thank you.

07:02:51.820 --> 07:02:52.780
Thank you.

07:02:52.780 --> 07:02:54.540
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

07:02:54.540 --> 07:02:55.020
for the record.

07:02:55.020 --> 07:02:55.580
You have one minute.

07:02:55.580 --> 07:02:56.540
Your time starts now.

07:03:01.820 --> 07:03:03.420
My name is Jody Christensen.

07:03:03.420 --> 07:03:05.420
As a parent of four children in Orange Unified

07:03:05.420 --> 07:03:07.340
who currently attend Panorama Elementary,

07:03:07.340 --> 07:03:10.780
Santiago Charter Middle School, and El Medina High School,

07:03:10.780 --> 07:03:12.860
I strongly oppose redefining the boundaries

07:03:12.860 --> 07:03:14.780
between Tustin Unified and Orange.

07:03:14.780 --> 07:03:17.180
Taking a large percentage of Panorama's elementaries

07:03:17.180 --> 07:03:19.340
would have a detrimental impact for all students

07:03:19.340 --> 07:03:21.420
at Panorama Elementary and subsequent schools,

07:03:21.420 --> 07:03:23.500
not just those who live in the immediate area.

07:03:23.500 --> 07:03:25.660
I have children who participate in sporting programs

07:03:25.660 --> 07:03:27.420
in Tustin as well as church activities

07:03:27.420 --> 07:03:29.260
and do not feel it is at all needed

07:03:29.260 --> 07:03:30.860
to transfer the school district boundaries

07:03:30.860 --> 07:03:33.100
to accommodate those community relationships.

07:03:33.100 --> 07:03:34.700
We choose to attend Panorama Elementary

07:03:34.700 --> 07:03:36.300
because of the high quality of education

07:03:36.300 --> 07:03:38.220
and family-friendly community.

07:03:38.220 --> 07:03:40.460
Santiago Charter has been a phenomenal experience

07:03:40.460 --> 07:03:41.820
as well as El Medina.

07:03:41.820 --> 07:03:44.220
Not only is the boundary change unnecessary,

07:03:44.220 --> 07:03:46.860
it is not worth the risk of damaging the strong community

07:03:46.860 --> 07:03:49.180
that can already be found within Orange Unified

07:03:49.180 --> 07:03:50.700
and its current boundaries.

07:03:50.780 --> 07:03:51.740
Thank you for your time.

07:03:53.260 --> 07:03:53.740
Thank you.

07:03:54.300 --> 07:03:55.740
Next caller, please state your name

07:03:55.740 --> 07:03:56.940
and affiliation for the record.

07:03:56.940 --> 07:03:57.500
You have one minute.

07:03:57.500 --> 07:03:58.460
Your time starts now.

07:04:02.300 --> 07:04:04.780
Hello, this is Lisa Green, Executive Director

07:04:04.780 --> 07:04:06.780
at Orange Unified School District.

07:04:06.780 --> 07:04:09.420
There is no valid reason why Panorama Elementary School's

07:04:09.420 --> 07:04:12.380
enrollment should be slashed while Arroyo Elementary School

07:04:12.380 --> 07:04:16.700
with 512 students stands to gain an additional 57 students.

07:04:16.700 --> 07:04:20.140
In fact, Arroyo does not currently offer any TK program

07:04:20.140 --> 07:04:21.980
according to Tustin's website.

07:04:21.980 --> 07:04:25.260
As such, TK students from the proposed transfer area

07:04:25.820 --> 07:04:28.060
will need to go elsewhere in Tustin Unified

07:04:28.060 --> 07:04:30.220
farther away from Panorama Elementary School.

07:04:30.780 --> 07:04:33.500
At the county committee meeting in 2017,

07:04:33.500 --> 07:04:35.260
at least three county committee members

07:04:35.260 --> 07:04:37.100
expressed their belief that Orange Unified

07:04:37.100 --> 07:04:39.580
would need to consider Panorama Elementary

07:04:39.580 --> 07:04:41.820
as a result of the transfer of students to Tustin.

07:04:42.380 --> 07:04:44.220
There is no discussion in the staff report

07:04:44.220 --> 07:04:45.980
about the ability of Arroyo

07:04:45.980 --> 07:04:48.620
to absorb an additional 57 students.

07:04:48.620 --> 07:04:51.260
Nor is there any discussion about the environmental impact

07:04:51.260 --> 07:04:54.380
of transporting 105 students to and from the schools

07:04:54.380 --> 07:04:55.820
in Tustin Unified.

07:04:55.820 --> 07:04:56.320
Thank you.

07:04:57.020 --> 07:04:57.520
Thank you.

07:04:58.380 --> 07:04:59.660
Next caller, please state your name

07:05:08.860 --> 07:05:11.180

Please start your public comment.

07:05:18.620 --> 07:05:21.660
Okay, moving on.

07:05:23.740 --> 07:05:25.180
Next caller, please state your name

07:05:25.180 --> 07:05:26.700
and affiliation for the record.

07:05:26.700 --> 07:05:27.500

07:05:27.500 --> 07:05:28.460
Your time starts now.

07:05:32.860 --> 07:05:35.340
Caller with the last four digits, 9, 3, 7, 6.

07:05:35.340 --> 07:05:35.980
You are live.

07:05:39.740 --> 07:05:40.700
My name is Brian Kerr.

07:05:40.700 --> 07:05:45.500
I'm a parent of two kids who are currently at Panorama

07:05:45.500 --> 07:05:47.020
within the affected area.

07:05:47.260 --> 07:05:49.180
I just want to say this is really about

07:05:50.140 --> 07:05:52.540
basically being as part of our community

07:05:52.540 --> 07:05:54.140
and essentially having schools

07:05:54.140 --> 07:05:56.060
that are within walking distance.

07:05:56.060 --> 07:05:58.220
I'm kind of offended that people talk about

07:05:58.220 --> 07:05:59.580
that it's about money

07:05:59.580 --> 07:06:01.820
or anything related to the quality of the schools.

07:06:01.820 --> 07:06:04.060
We just really want to stay aligned

07:06:04.060 --> 07:06:06.540
with essentially what's close to us

07:06:06.540 --> 07:06:08.140
and the people that we deal with.

07:06:09.820 --> 07:06:11.740
As far as the public comment here,

07:06:11.740 --> 07:06:13.100
I'm a little bit disappointed to hear

07:06:13.100 --> 07:06:15.180
that so many people in opposition to this

07:06:15.180 --> 07:06:16.540
aren't the people in the area.

07:06:16.540 --> 07:06:18.860
They're basically employees of the district

07:06:18.860 --> 07:06:21.820
and people who live in Orange

07:06:21.820 --> 07:06:25.820
or basically had kids or went to Orange Unified

07:06:25.820 --> 07:06:27.580
that are not in the affected area.

07:06:27.580 --> 07:06:29.100
And I think it's really important

07:06:29.100 --> 07:06:30.940
to listen to the parents and the families

07:06:30.940 --> 07:06:31.980
within the affected area

07:06:31.980 --> 07:06:33.900
to allow us to remain with our community.

07:06:34.620 --> 07:06:37.020
In fact, I was at a meeting at our elementary school

07:06:37.020 --> 07:06:38.540
and about the 10 families there,

07:06:38.540 --> 07:06:40.220
I'd say nine out of the 10 of them,

07:06:40.220 --> 07:06:44.220
really wanted to see this transfer go through

07:06:44.220 --> 07:06:46.300
just so we could effectively stay with our community.

07:06:46.300 --> 07:06:48.380
So I really urge the board

07:06:48.380 --> 07:06:51.020
to allow the community to stay together

07:06:51.020 --> 07:06:52.860
and to allow our kids basically safe,

07:06:52.860 --> 07:06:55.820
walking distance schools to enjoy

07:06:55.820 --> 07:06:58.620
and then also be at school with friends

07:06:58.620 --> 07:07:00.540
that they have in activities outside of school

07:07:00.540 --> 07:07:01.660
so they're not bifurcated.

07:07:02.540 --> 07:07:03.740
Next caller, please state your name

07:07:03.740 --> 07:07:04.940
and affiliation for the record.

07:07:04.940 --> 07:07:05.500
You have one minute.

07:07:05.500 --> 07:07:06.460
Your time starts now.

07:07:11.260 --> 07:07:13.820
Caller with the last four digits 7684,

07:07:13.820 --> 07:07:14.620
you are now live.

07:07:14.620 --> 07:07:15.900
Please start your public comment.

07:07:16.300 --> 07:07:24.620
Okay, looks like they might have had a connection problem.

07:07:24.620 --> 07:07:26.060
Next caller, please state your name

07:07:26.060 --> 07:07:27.340
and affiliation for the record.

07:07:27.340 --> 07:07:28.140
You have one minute.

07:07:28.140 --> 07:07:29.100
Your time starts now.

07:07:32.620 --> 07:07:33.900
Why are you hanging me up?

07:07:34.620 --> 07:07:35.120
Hello?

07:07:36.380 --> 07:07:37.100
You are live.

07:07:37.100 --> 07:07:38.220
Please start your public comment.

07:07:40.860 --> 07:07:41.420
Oh, hi.

07:07:41.420 --> 07:07:42.300
I'm so sorry.

07:07:42.300 --> 07:07:44.300
I disconnected three different times.

07:07:45.260 --> 07:07:46.700
My name is Anna Lamikas.

07:07:46.700 --> 07:07:51.740
I am a 36-year resident of Panorama Heights.

07:07:51.740 --> 07:07:52.860
I've grown up here.

07:07:53.580 --> 07:07:55.580
Now I'm raising my daughter up here.

07:07:55.580 --> 07:07:57.820
She's a current student at Panorama Elementary.

07:07:57.820 --> 07:07:59.100
She's in fifth grade.

07:07:59.100 --> 07:08:02.300
I am greatly concerned about this rezoning.

07:08:02.300 --> 07:08:03.820
I do not agree with it.

07:08:04.460 --> 07:08:07.980
I believe that Panorama Heights should remain with OUSD.

07:08:07.980 --> 07:08:11.740
I find that I've been wanting to have her go

07:08:11.740 --> 07:08:15.820
to Santiago Middle School and that my concern

07:08:15.820 --> 07:08:18.060
that she's now going to be almost forced to go to Hughes

07:08:18.060 --> 07:08:19.900
where she has no friends.

07:08:19.900 --> 07:08:22.780
She has no identity with Tustin.

07:08:23.340 --> 07:08:25.740
All of our identity has always been with Orange.

07:08:26.940 --> 07:08:29.020
Growing up here, my whole life,

07:08:29.020 --> 07:08:31.900
I've always identified myself as part of Orange,

07:08:31.900 --> 07:08:33.660
not part of Tustin.

07:08:33.660 --> 07:08:37.260
North Tustin has been a very new thing in the last so many years

07:08:37.660 --> 07:08:42.460
based on my experience and my time frame here.

07:08:42.460 --> 07:08:47.580
Also, I have been approached in 2017 by neighbors

07:08:50.460 --> 07:08:54.060
about this petition and that concludes public comment

07:08:54.060 --> 07:08:55.020
for item number 10.

07:09:00.700 --> 07:09:05.180
Thank you very much to all the callers who have called in

07:09:05.180 --> 07:09:09.100
and at this moment, I'm going to close the public hearing

07:09:09.100 --> 07:09:10.700
at 4.50 p.m.

07:09:13.100 --> 07:09:15.420
and we will begin board discussion.

07:09:15.420 --> 07:09:17.260
My computer is about to run out of juice

07:09:17.260 --> 07:09:19.100
in one second moment, so plug it in.

07:09:20.460 --> 07:09:21.100
There we go.

07:09:22.620 --> 07:09:24.460
So we can continue, there we go.

07:09:26.220 --> 07:09:30.620
Let's start off with Member Escobedo who is our liaison

07:09:30.620 --> 07:09:32.380
if you'd like to make some initial comments

07:09:32.380 --> 07:09:33.820
and then we'll go into board discussion.

07:09:35.180 --> 07:09:39.100
Surely, I would like to first thank all the presenters

07:09:39.100 --> 07:09:42.700
who testified, the members of the public who phoned in

07:09:42.700 --> 07:09:45.580
and all those who wrote letters about the item

07:09:46.940 --> 07:09:49.420
very much appreciate the thoughtful input

07:09:49.420 --> 07:09:52.140
and also appreciate CDE and all the work

07:09:52.140 --> 07:09:54.700
in doing those nine requirements.

07:09:54.700 --> 07:09:58.860
It was a painstaking task, I'm sure, in reviewing them.

07:09:59.580 --> 07:10:02.700
I just want to share that I know that these

07:10:02.700 --> 07:10:06.060
district reorganization proposals are very emotional

07:10:06.060 --> 07:10:09.580
and raise some real tough issues for school districts

07:10:10.540 --> 07:10:14.940
and what is community identity?

07:10:14.940 --> 07:10:20.860
And I think we heard from both sides many strong views.

07:10:23.100 --> 07:10:26.780
I do understand that the county committee complied

07:10:26.780 --> 07:10:30.700
with the requirements of the local territory

07:10:30.700 --> 07:10:35.980
transfer process and determined that all nine

07:10:35.980 --> 07:10:38.780
minimum threshold conditions in Ed code

07:10:38.780 --> 07:10:43.180
were substantially met and CDE showed us the evidence.

07:10:44.540 --> 07:10:48.220
However, I'm still concerned with the issues raised

07:10:48.220 --> 07:10:53.340
by Orange Unified regarding the impact of the transfer

07:10:54.700 --> 07:10:57.980
and I'm also concerned about the long-term effects

07:10:57.980 --> 07:11:01.100
on culture and the precedent it would set.

07:11:01.100 --> 07:11:03.340
I heard that there were two other areas

07:11:03.340 --> 07:11:05.740
that could transfer as well.

07:11:05.740 --> 07:11:08.940
So those are my initial thoughts and I look forward

07:11:08.940 --> 07:11:14.860
to having more discussion and thoughts about this item.

07:11:15.980 --> 07:11:17.500
Thank you so much.

07:11:17.500 --> 07:11:19.900
With that, we're going to open up board discussion.

07:11:20.700 --> 07:11:24.220
So if you have a comment or a question,

07:11:25.020 --> 07:11:25.820
please raise your hand.

07:11:25.820 --> 07:11:28.540
I do want to say before we start board discussion

07:11:28.540 --> 07:11:30.460
that for those who are panelists,

07:11:31.340 --> 07:11:33.180
if a board member has a question for you,

07:11:33.180 --> 07:11:36.540
you will be recognized and unmuted so you can respond.

07:11:36.540 --> 07:11:38.780
But please do not raise your hand during the board's

07:11:38.780 --> 07:11:43.580
deliberation or seek to engage unless you're called upon.

07:11:44.220 --> 07:11:48.060
With that, I'm going to start with member Orozco Gonzalez.

07:11:48.060 --> 07:11:51.580
I want to.

07:11:54.140 --> 07:11:57.900
I think I concur with what member Orozco Gonzalez said.

07:11:57.900 --> 07:12:01.180
I think that the CDE did an excellent job

07:12:01.180 --> 07:12:02.620
in doing an analysis.

07:12:03.740 --> 07:12:07.340
And I know that they're trying to go with more local control

07:12:07.980 --> 07:12:10.460
but I am concerned of the fiscal impact

07:12:10.460 --> 07:12:14.060
this will have on Orange County,

07:12:14.060 --> 07:12:15.820
Orange Unified School District.

07:12:15.820 --> 07:12:19.020
And also, I understand that it could be a very tedious

07:12:19.020 --> 07:12:21.980
process to fill out the necessary paperwork

07:12:21.980 --> 07:12:23.580
for the intra-district permits.

07:12:24.780 --> 07:12:27.900
But this is a choice that we're making as a family

07:12:27.900 --> 07:12:30.220
when they purchased their property

07:12:30.220 --> 07:12:33.100
and they decided that they wanted to live there,

07:12:33.100 --> 07:12:36.220
it was in Orange Unified School District territory.

07:12:36.220 --> 07:12:39.980
So I just, I'm so concerned over the fiscal impact

07:12:39.980 --> 07:12:42.940
and that the students that are currently going

07:12:42.940 --> 07:12:47.020
to Orange County, Orange Unified School District,

07:12:47.020 --> 07:12:50.380
schools have to now apply to move,

07:12:51.260 --> 07:12:53.340
to stay with their own schools.

07:12:53.340 --> 07:12:56.860
So I think I still have a lot of concern over that.

07:12:57.420 --> 07:12:59.660
So it's more of a comment than it is a question.

07:13:01.020 --> 07:13:01.420
Thank you.

07:13:01.420 --> 07:13:02.460
And member Lewis.

07:13:05.100 --> 07:13:07.260
Okay, thank you.

07:13:07.260 --> 07:13:10.940
First of all, thank you to the CDE

07:13:10.940 --> 07:13:13.260
and to the two districts for their presentation

07:13:13.260 --> 07:13:16.300
and for all of the parents and staff members

07:13:16.300 --> 07:13:18.620
who called in in public comment.

07:13:20.860 --> 07:13:24.380
I do agree or have some of the same concerns

07:13:24.380 --> 07:13:25.900
expressed by my two colleagues.

07:13:25.900 --> 07:13:27.500
I do have a couple of questions.

07:13:28.780 --> 07:13:32.700
For the CDE staff, during the presentation,

07:13:35.980 --> 07:13:40.460
you seem very convinced that other territories

07:13:40.540 --> 07:13:44.380
left in the Tustin area would not follow suit

07:13:44.380 --> 07:13:48.620
and also try to remove themselves

07:13:48.620 --> 07:13:50.860
from the Orange Unified School District.

07:13:50.860 --> 07:13:53.260
I just need, what do you base that on?

07:13:55.020 --> 07:13:57.580
If you could just elaborate on that a little bit more.

07:13:57.580 --> 07:14:00.060
It was a quick comment and then moved on,

07:14:00.060 --> 07:14:01.580
but what do you base that on?

07:14:02.940 --> 07:14:07.020
Yeah, it's, for those of you that have been on the board

07:14:07.020 --> 07:14:09.420
for a while, that's a big concern for us,

07:14:09.420 --> 07:14:11.580
has always been in territory transfers,

07:14:12.220 --> 07:14:14.540
is a concern that this kind of starts

07:14:14.540 --> 07:14:16.380
the cascading effect for others,

07:14:17.100 --> 07:14:19.740
other territories that meet the same circumstances.

07:14:21.580 --> 07:14:23.340
Certainly there's a potential for that,

07:14:23.340 --> 07:14:28.060
but we based our recommendation, our findings,

07:14:28.060 --> 07:14:32.620
on the fact that if we look at those areas that remain

07:14:32.620 --> 07:14:34.380
that have similar circumstances

07:14:35.260 --> 07:14:37.820
in terms of being part of North Tustin,

07:14:37.820 --> 07:14:41.020
the North Tustin area, there really aren't that many left.

07:14:41.020 --> 07:14:45.740
So the ultimate impact would not be really great.

07:14:45.740 --> 07:14:48.860
We're not saying certainly that those areas wouldn't go,

07:14:48.860 --> 07:14:53.740
it's just that if they do, it's not,

07:14:55.100 --> 07:14:58.140
there are limited numbers of homes and students

07:14:58.140 --> 07:15:00.940
that are left in the North Tustin area

07:15:00.940 --> 07:15:02.860
that are still part of Orange Unified.

07:15:04.780 --> 07:15:05.820
Okay, thank you.

07:15:06.780 --> 07:15:09.980
The other question was, we talked a lot about

07:15:09.980 --> 07:15:15.340
the 2012 transfer of Rocking Horse.

07:15:16.140 --> 07:15:17.980
What was the 2002 transfer?

07:15:17.980 --> 07:15:19.900
What was the circumstances behind that?

07:15:21.740 --> 07:15:24.700
Yeah, it was an area that was very close

07:15:24.700 --> 07:15:26.940
to the Rocking Horse Ridge transfer.

07:15:28.940 --> 07:15:31.580
Again, it was an area that the county committee approved

07:15:31.580 --> 07:15:34.380
and no one, none of the districts opposed.

07:15:35.020 --> 07:15:38.460
It had some geographic circumstances, I believe,

07:15:38.460 --> 07:15:42.220
that probably prompted the local actions.

07:15:43.660 --> 07:15:47.820
It's kind of separated from the rest of Orange Unified

07:15:47.820 --> 07:15:54.380
by a reservoir and a very preserve-like area.

07:15:54.380 --> 07:15:57.180
So I'm not that familiar with it,

07:15:57.180 --> 07:15:59.100
but if I were looking at it,

07:15:59.100 --> 07:16:02.060
I would assume that there were some geographic concerns

07:16:02.060 --> 07:16:04.140
or geographic issues that were raised

07:16:04.700 --> 07:16:07.100
that prompted the county committee to approve it

07:16:07.100 --> 07:16:10.140
and prompted both school districts to remain neutral.

07:16:12.060 --> 07:16:12.540
Thank you.

07:16:13.260 --> 07:16:14.940
I just have one more question for

07:16:16.540 --> 07:16:18.940
the Orange Unified School District

07:16:18.940 --> 07:16:20.380
regarding the IT process.

07:16:21.660 --> 07:16:23.740
I'm familiar with the process and I know

07:16:25.100 --> 07:16:27.980
that a determining factor of whether or not

07:16:27.980 --> 07:16:31.420
students get a transfer to the school of choice

07:16:31.500 --> 07:16:34.460
is if the school that they're going to,

07:16:34.460 --> 07:16:36.380
the enrollment is already impacted,

07:16:37.340 --> 07:16:40.060
they can transfer for educational programs.

07:16:40.780 --> 07:16:42.300
There were several comments

07:16:42.300 --> 07:16:44.940
about the process being difficult.

07:16:44.940 --> 07:16:47.820
Could you just succinctly just explain

07:16:47.820 --> 07:16:49.340
if your process is any different

07:16:49.340 --> 07:16:52.620
than the normal process and reasons for transfer?

07:17:02.380 --> 07:17:05.420
I believe that's for me to be unmuted.

07:17:05.420 --> 07:17:05.900
Thank you.

07:17:06.460 --> 07:17:07.500
Thank you for the question.

07:17:08.380 --> 07:17:10.300
In Orange Unified School District,

07:17:10.300 --> 07:17:13.660
we follow the education code on inter-district transfers.

07:17:13.660 --> 07:17:15.500
So there are some that are automatic

07:17:15.500 --> 07:17:20.700
based on parent work, child care, educational programs.

07:17:20.700 --> 07:17:23.660
And we have 401, as was mentioned,

07:17:23.660 --> 07:17:26.060
that are on inter-district transfer to Tustin.

07:17:26.700 --> 07:17:31.100
And then we don't think our process at all is difficult

07:17:31.180 --> 07:17:32.700
because there's no questions asked

07:17:32.700 --> 07:17:34.300
if they meet the education code

07:17:34.300 --> 07:17:36.140
and the criteria to transfer.

07:17:36.940 --> 07:17:38.380
However, if they are in our district,

07:17:38.380 --> 07:17:40.460
we do take time to ask them,

07:17:40.460 --> 07:17:41.900
would you like to visit our schools?

07:17:41.900 --> 07:17:45.500
And we have an internal process to discuss,

07:17:45.900 --> 07:17:47.580
would you still like to visit El Medina?

07:17:47.580 --> 07:17:49.580
Would you like to visit Santiago?

07:17:49.580 --> 07:17:51.180
But it's certainly not difficult.

07:17:51.180 --> 07:17:53.740
In that attendance area, like was stated,

07:17:53.740 --> 07:17:56.940
there are 21 students that are on inter-district process.

07:17:56.940 --> 07:17:59.180
The petitioners who spoke here today

07:17:59.180 --> 07:18:02.540
are on ongoing continuous,

07:18:03.180 --> 07:18:05.980
which is part of the education code as well, transfers.

07:18:05.980 --> 07:18:07.660
There's no questions asked.

07:18:07.660 --> 07:18:10.060
The issue is on the side of Tustin

07:18:10.060 --> 07:18:12.060
that I believe like seven or eight years ago,

07:18:12.620 --> 07:18:15.420
they may have closed for enrollment,

07:18:15.420 --> 07:18:17.100
but that has nothing to do with us.

07:18:17.100 --> 07:18:18.700
And they certainly are embracing.

07:18:20.620 --> 07:18:23.340
Right now, Tustin has embracing,

07:18:23.340 --> 07:18:25.340
because of declining enrollment,

07:18:25.340 --> 07:18:28.700
which was one of the aspects that we talked about,

07:18:29.740 --> 07:18:31.900
they certainly are embracing any student,

07:18:31.900 --> 07:18:34.140
and there's no problem for any of these families

07:18:34.140 --> 07:18:36.540
if they'd like to transfer to Tustin Unified.

07:18:36.540 --> 07:18:37.820
We would certainly support that.

07:18:39.420 --> 07:18:40.220
Thank you.

07:18:40.220 --> 07:18:40.620
Thank you.

07:18:41.900 --> 07:18:43.740
I'm going to call on Member Olken

07:18:43.740 --> 07:18:45.660
and then Vice President Glover-Woods.

07:18:46.620 --> 07:18:47.340
Member Olken.

07:18:48.140 --> 07:18:49.340
Thank you so much.

07:18:49.340 --> 07:18:53.740
I just want to also thank all of you who presented today

07:18:53.740 --> 07:18:56.060
and all of the public who called in.

07:18:56.860 --> 07:19:01.740
I, you hear a lot of, we heard a lot of emotion

07:19:03.740 --> 07:19:08.300
and a lot of emotion about this item.

07:19:08.300 --> 07:19:11.900
And I think schools feel very personal.

07:19:12.700 --> 07:19:14.700
And in fact, I think the very best schools

07:19:14.700 --> 07:19:16.780
feel really personal.

07:19:16.780 --> 07:19:18.780
And so there's something about what we heard that

07:19:19.420 --> 07:19:25.900
to me is a sign of strong communities

07:19:25.900 --> 07:19:27.020
in all of these schools.

07:19:28.620 --> 07:19:33.180
And that said, I do, just one comment,

07:19:33.180 --> 07:19:37.580
and then I have some questions for our CDE colleague.

07:19:39.420 --> 07:19:43.980
Just a general approach or belief that I have

07:19:43.980 --> 07:19:47.820
is that the schools belong to the public.

07:19:49.340 --> 07:19:55.100
Instead of the other way around, the public,

07:19:56.300 --> 07:19:57.740
so the schools belong to the public

07:19:57.740 --> 07:19:59.020
instead of the other way around.

07:19:59.900 --> 07:20:03.420
And that the public belongs to any particular school.

07:20:04.620 --> 07:20:11.020
And I just want to put that out there for us

07:20:11.020 --> 07:20:12.700
as we're thinking about this because,

07:20:12.700 --> 07:20:20.940
because I think that's an important philosophical approach.

07:20:22.220 --> 07:20:26.220
And that said, all of the public comment

07:20:26.220 --> 07:20:33.740
and the assertions from Orange about the impact

07:20:33.740 --> 07:20:36.380
on the diversity of the schools

07:20:36.380 --> 07:20:41.340
and perhaps the motivation for this proposal,

07:20:42.060 --> 07:20:43.900
I think, weigh on all of us heavily.

07:20:44.460 --> 07:20:48.300
And so my questions are really trying to get back

07:20:48.300 --> 07:20:51.100
to the data that we saw about

07:20:51.100 --> 07:20:53.260
what the potential impact would be.

07:20:53.260 --> 07:20:56.860
So I was wondering if sort of,

07:20:56.860 --> 07:20:58.620
I think I have three questions.

07:20:58.620 --> 07:21:02.540
One is just a reminder of the number of students

07:21:02.540 --> 07:21:07.020
that would be impacted by the territory transfer

07:21:07.020 --> 07:21:09.820
and then how that relates to the overall size

07:21:09.900 --> 07:21:11.500
of the two districts in question.

07:21:12.620 --> 07:21:16.860
And then the third question is just a refresher

07:21:16.860 --> 07:21:18.220
because it was a long time ago

07:21:19.980 --> 07:21:25.180
before the public comment on why CD does not believe

07:21:25.180 --> 07:21:28.860
that the territory transfer would have a significant impact

07:21:28.860 --> 07:21:33.100
on the diversity of the schools involved.

07:21:35.500 --> 07:21:37.660
So I'm just hoping to see that data one more time.

07:21:39.820 --> 07:21:43.980
So Larry, I think we are asking for you to pop up again

07:21:45.100 --> 07:21:47.580
and provide that data.

07:21:49.580 --> 07:21:52.060
I'm working backwards from the presentation.

07:21:52.060 --> 07:21:52.780
Thank you.

07:21:52.780 --> 07:21:57.420
This is the socioeconomic indicators that we look at.

07:21:57.420 --> 07:21:59.100
At the district level,

07:21:59.100 --> 07:22:01.980
there really isn't a whole lot of difference.

07:22:02.860 --> 07:22:08.140
But the Orange Unified's concern is more at the school level

07:22:08.220 --> 07:22:10.380
and at the schools that serve the area,

07:22:10.380 --> 07:22:13.100
and Orange Unified or the schools in Tustin Unified

07:22:13.100 --> 07:22:14.700
that would serve the area,

07:22:14.700 --> 07:22:15.980
there is quite a bit of difference.

07:22:16.540 --> 07:22:18.540
And again, as been alluded to,

07:22:18.540 --> 07:22:19.980
I think in a lot of the comments,

07:22:19.980 --> 07:22:24.300
the North Tustin unincorporated area

07:22:24.300 --> 07:22:27.100
is considered one of the more affluent areas

07:22:27.100 --> 07:22:27.980
of Orange County.

07:22:28.780 --> 07:22:30.460
And these are the schools that,

07:22:31.100 --> 07:22:33.180
these Tustin Unified schools

07:22:33.180 --> 07:22:35.580
are the schools that would serve that area.

07:22:35.580 --> 07:22:40.380
So it kind of reflects the demographics of North Tustin.

07:22:45.180 --> 07:22:47.180
Can I ask a clarifying question on that?

07:22:48.540 --> 07:22:50.780
Just to make sure I understand what I'm looking at.

07:22:54.700 --> 07:22:55.200
Thank you.

07:22:56.220 --> 07:22:58.140
So I just want to make sure I understand.

07:22:58.140 --> 07:23:01.900
So the way I read this to take, for example,

07:23:02.860 --> 07:23:05.740
eligibility for free and reduced price meal program,

07:23:06.860 --> 07:23:11.660
students who the overall percentage of eligibility

07:23:11.660 --> 07:23:16.220
at Panorama is 20% or 19.9.

07:23:16.220 --> 07:23:19.260
And then the school that students,

07:23:19.260 --> 07:23:23.180
if this territory transfer takes place,

07:23:23.180 --> 07:23:25.580
the school that those students would, in essence,

07:23:25.580 --> 07:23:29.180
be reassigned to is Arroyo Elementary,

07:23:29.180 --> 07:23:32.940
where the free and reduced price meal program eligibility

07:23:32.940 --> 07:23:33.900
is 7.2%.

07:23:34.940 --> 07:23:36.940
Is that my understanding that correctly?

07:23:36.940 --> 07:23:37.500
Yes, you are.

07:23:38.380 --> 07:23:39.180
Okay, thank you.

07:23:40.060 --> 07:23:43.020
And maybe just while we have that slide up to note,

07:23:43.020 --> 07:23:48.140
the English learner population is smaller at Tustin

07:23:48.140 --> 07:23:52.540
and the students with socioeconomically disadvantaged

07:23:52.540 --> 07:23:55.900
student population is disparate as well.

07:23:56.620 --> 07:24:00.940
So we're all reading the same lines on the graph.

07:24:00.940 --> 07:24:01.340
Yeah.

07:24:01.340 --> 07:24:05.260
And so while the first chart you showed us...

07:24:06.860 --> 07:24:07.500
About racial?

07:24:08.700 --> 07:24:15.180
No, so just the districts as a whole are relatively similar,

07:24:15.820 --> 07:24:21.100
but the particular neighborhoods or the schools

07:24:21.100 --> 07:24:24.940
that would serve the kids in the particular transfer area

07:24:26.220 --> 07:24:28.860
have the discrepancies or the differences

07:24:28.860 --> 07:24:31.260
that you just showed us on the last slide.

07:24:32.700 --> 07:24:33.260
Correct.

07:24:33.260 --> 07:24:35.740
You know, as I think I mentioned earlier,

07:24:36.460 --> 07:24:45.740
if you look at Tustin Unified, certainly those,

07:24:45.740 --> 07:24:48.540
the elementary and the middle and the high school...

07:24:49.340 --> 07:24:51.100
Let's just look at the high school,

07:24:51.100 --> 07:24:55.340
because I pointed out some of the differences

07:24:55.340 --> 07:24:59.020
at the other high schools in Tustin Unified.

07:25:00.140 --> 07:25:02.860
Foothill High School, as I mentioned,

07:25:03.420 --> 07:25:05.020
was relatively equal.

07:25:05.020 --> 07:25:09.020
We're going to move to the racial ethnic composition.

07:25:09.660 --> 07:25:12.780
Foothill High is relatively equivalent

07:25:12.780 --> 07:25:15.980
in terms of the two major racial ethnic groups,

07:25:16.540 --> 07:25:20.460
Hispanic, Latino, and white, about 45% a piece.

07:25:21.100 --> 07:25:24.780
But if you look at the other two high schools

07:25:24.780 --> 07:25:27.820
in Tustin Unified, Tustin High School,

07:25:27.820 --> 07:25:31.580
which is, I think, if I recall, 82% Hispanic

07:25:31.580 --> 07:25:36.220
and less than 8% white, and then Beckman High School,

07:25:36.220 --> 07:25:42.380
which is 20% for both Hispanic, Latino students

07:25:42.380 --> 07:25:44.700
and white students, but is 40% Asian.

07:25:46.300 --> 07:25:49.100
The composition of those three high schools in Tustin

07:25:49.100 --> 07:25:52.220
are very different, and that's what we're looking at here,

07:25:52.220 --> 07:25:56.060
just the area that serves the North Tustin community,

07:25:56.060 --> 07:25:58.460
but when you aggregate the populations

07:25:58.460 --> 07:25:59.580
of the three high schools,

07:26:00.540 --> 07:26:04.540
they reflect the district-wide comparisons.

07:26:05.340 --> 07:26:07.820
Gotcha, and this may be more detailed

07:26:07.820 --> 07:26:12.700
than you are prepared to answer,

07:26:12.700 --> 07:26:14.780
but do you know if these districts...

07:26:15.660 --> 07:26:18.780
Does Tustin have neighborhood schools

07:26:20.220 --> 07:26:21.340
up through high school?

07:26:22.700 --> 07:26:24.540
And if you don't know, yes.

07:26:24.540 --> 07:26:28.540
It has elementary, middle, and high schools,

07:26:28.540 --> 07:26:30.300
just like Orange Unified does.

07:26:32.380 --> 07:26:34.220
That last slide showed them,

07:26:34.220 --> 07:26:35.580
showed the feeder patterns.

07:26:36.140 --> 07:26:37.260
Okay, thank you.

07:26:37.260 --> 07:26:38.460
Just wanted to confirm.

07:26:38.460 --> 07:26:38.860
Thank you.

07:26:39.420 --> 07:26:41.180
All right, Vice President Glover-Woods

07:26:41.180 --> 07:26:43.100
and then Member Yoshimoto-Tari.

07:26:43.980 --> 07:26:47.020
Just one question for CDE

07:26:47.020 --> 07:26:49.660
and two questions for Orange Unified.

07:26:50.940 --> 07:26:54.780
Just to clarify, can you share with us

07:26:55.580 --> 07:26:58.460
when you were looking again at the data

07:26:58.460 --> 07:27:00.300
and the ethnic composition,

07:27:01.420 --> 07:27:06.860
the rationale of looking at all of the Tustin high schools

07:27:07.660 --> 07:27:13.260
in total for the ethnic breakdown,

07:27:13.260 --> 07:27:14.700
for the demographic breakdown,

07:27:15.340 --> 07:27:19.900
as opposed to looking at the high schools

07:27:19.900 --> 07:27:23.180
and the middle school that would be

07:27:23.180 --> 07:27:28.780
in the feeder pattern of the actual area in question?

07:27:30.300 --> 07:27:33.340
And let me say before you answer, sir,

07:27:33.340 --> 07:27:37.900
I understand that if you were to look at the districts in full,

07:27:38.620 --> 07:27:44.300
that the demographic percentages are very similar.

07:27:44.860 --> 07:27:47.420
I'm looking more so for an understanding

07:27:47.420 --> 07:27:51.900
on why that would be utilized as part of the rationale

07:27:51.900 --> 07:27:54.220
as opposed to looking at the schools

07:27:54.220 --> 07:27:57.900
that would be actually the homeschools, if you will,

07:27:58.460 --> 07:28:01.420
for this section in question.

07:28:02.380 --> 07:28:03.020
Right.

07:28:03.020 --> 07:28:06.140
The whole point of this condition,

07:28:06.140 --> 07:28:08.540
of whether or not the proposed transfer

07:28:08.540 --> 07:28:11.020
would have negative effects on the district

07:28:11.020 --> 07:28:15.420
or a school's ability to offer an educational,

07:28:16.220 --> 07:28:18.620
to educate students in an integrated environment,

07:28:19.660 --> 07:28:22.540
that's what we're looking at when we look at the schools.

07:28:22.540 --> 07:28:24.620
We only showed Panorama Elementary

07:28:24.620 --> 07:28:26.860
because the effects would be big,

07:28:26.860 --> 07:28:31.340
would be largest on Panorama Elementary

07:28:31.340 --> 07:28:33.100
because of the size of the school,

07:28:33.100 --> 07:28:35.420
about fewer than 400 students,

07:28:35.980 --> 07:28:37.660
and it's got more grade levels

07:28:37.660 --> 07:28:39.180
than a middle school or a high school,

07:28:39.180 --> 07:28:42.460
so the number of schools in the transfer area would be greater.

07:28:42.460 --> 07:28:47.580
So pulling at 50, it was about 14%, I believe,

07:28:47.580 --> 07:28:51.580
the indicated of the students out of Panorama Elementary

07:28:51.580 --> 07:28:57.580
based on the racial ethnic percentages of the students

07:28:57.580 --> 07:29:02.460
in the Panorama Heights area would change things very little.

07:29:02.460 --> 07:29:06.780
It would move the percentage of Hispanic or Latino students

07:29:06.780 --> 07:29:12.620
at the school from 35.4% to 35.8%.

07:29:12.620 --> 07:29:16.140
It would move the percentage of white students at the school

07:29:16.140 --> 07:29:19.580
from 46.1% to 47.3%.

07:29:21.820 --> 07:29:26.860
So given that effect, and that's what we're looking at,

07:29:26.860 --> 07:29:29.180
what's the effect of the transfer on the ability

07:29:29.180 --> 07:29:31.260
to all have an integrated environment?

07:29:31.260 --> 07:29:32.220
We didn't see one.

07:29:34.220 --> 07:29:36.140
Okay, and am I correct in understanding

07:29:36.140 --> 07:29:38.300
that the percentage difference

07:29:38.300 --> 07:29:44.700
for the middle school and the high school were minimal?

07:29:45.260 --> 07:29:48.940
Yeah, and again, the middle school and the high school is larger

07:29:49.900 --> 07:29:54.140
in terms of student populations relative to the elementary school.

07:29:54.140 --> 07:29:58.460
Additionally, the grade levels that are affected are fewer.

07:29:58.460 --> 07:30:01.020
You have three grade levels at a middle school,

07:30:01.020 --> 07:30:03.180
four grade levels at a high school

07:30:03.180 --> 07:30:05.340
versus the six grade levels

07:30:05.340 --> 07:30:07.580
that you would have at an elementary school.

07:30:07.580 --> 07:30:10.140
So the numbers of students that would transfer

07:30:12.460 --> 07:30:15.420
from a middle school or the high school are smaller,

07:30:16.220 --> 07:30:19.980
and the enrollments are larger at those schools.

07:30:19.980 --> 07:30:25.580
So the effects of instead of one or two percentage points shift,

07:30:25.580 --> 07:30:27.580
it would be in the tenths of a percentage point.

07:30:29.580 --> 07:30:31.980
Thank you. That helps to clarify.

07:30:31.980 --> 07:30:36.060
And my two questions for the representative from Orange Unified.

07:30:36.860 --> 07:30:44.620
One, can you share with us the number of inter-district requests,

07:30:44.620 --> 07:30:47.900
inter-district permit requests to test in Unified

07:30:47.900 --> 07:30:49.340
that have not been honored?

07:30:49.980 --> 07:30:52.700
And so I'll start with that question,

07:30:52.700 --> 07:30:55.580
and then I have one last question for the district reps.

07:30:57.820 --> 07:31:01.020
We have absolutely no inter-district transfers

07:31:01.020 --> 07:31:02.940
that have been denied on appeal,

07:31:02.940 --> 07:31:04.700
which is the process to the county.

07:31:05.580 --> 07:31:07.660
Zero for testing.

07:31:07.660 --> 07:31:09.260
Thank you. Thank you very much.

07:31:09.900 --> 07:31:14.860
My last question is in relation to the concern,

07:31:14.860 --> 07:31:19.820
the impact that has been communicated by the district

07:31:19.820 --> 07:31:23.660
on removal of the students from the Panorama Heights area.

07:31:24.620 --> 07:31:28.380
I noticed that one of the concerns

07:31:29.180 --> 07:31:32.620
was that there would be reduced parental participation

07:31:33.260 --> 07:31:35.340
at Panorama Elementary School.

07:31:35.900 --> 07:31:41.020
Can you share with us the rationale for believing

07:31:41.020 --> 07:31:44.780
that there would be reduced parental participation

07:31:44.780 --> 07:31:47.500
if the students in Panorama Heights were removed?

07:31:49.660 --> 07:31:53.340
Well, Panorama Elementary is the community school

07:31:53.340 --> 07:31:58.060
closest to the proposed transfer area.

07:31:58.860 --> 07:32:01.260
Their attendance area would be cut in half.

07:32:01.980 --> 07:32:05.580
The school that they would go to

07:32:05.580 --> 07:32:08.700
if the transfer went to Tustin is Arroyo.

07:32:08.700 --> 07:32:09.980
It is farther away.

07:32:10.700 --> 07:32:14.380
We would lose 57 parents at that school

07:32:14.380 --> 07:32:16.860
that are highly involved, highly engaged,

07:32:16.860 --> 07:32:19.580
and you heard some of them speak this evening.

07:32:19.580 --> 07:32:22.620
So it is the community school for Panorama Heights.

07:32:22.620 --> 07:32:25.580
It has the name Panorama Elementary,

07:32:25.580 --> 07:32:28.540
and it is also a very, very small school.

07:32:28.620 --> 07:32:33.180
So 57 students is a huge impact in losing the families

07:32:33.180 --> 07:32:35.260
that are right across Crawford Canyon.

07:32:35.260 --> 07:32:38.220
Losing all of those families that are engaged

07:32:38.220 --> 07:32:40.460
in your school is a significant issue.

07:32:45.020 --> 07:32:49.180
Does that, are you, any other questions,

07:32:49.180 --> 07:32:50.700
Vice President Clover Woods?

07:32:52.300 --> 07:32:53.900
Member Yoshimaru Tari.

07:32:55.340 --> 07:32:56.380
Thank you, Board President.

07:32:57.260 --> 07:32:59.660
I recognize that these decisions are very difficult.

07:33:00.220 --> 07:33:01.180
There are many factors.

07:33:01.180 --> 07:33:03.100
It's very personal, and the process takes years.

07:33:04.380 --> 07:33:06.220
So thank you to everybody who spoke today

07:33:06.780 --> 07:33:09.260
and to CDE for preparing the report

07:33:09.820 --> 07:33:12.060
and those involved at the local level.

07:33:13.660 --> 07:33:14.780
I did want to make a comment.

07:33:14.780 --> 07:33:16.620
I'm appreciative of a process

07:33:16.620 --> 07:33:19.020
that doesn't have complete deference

07:33:19.020 --> 07:33:20.460
to the previous level of appeal,

07:33:21.100 --> 07:33:24.140
not due to any lack of trust to the previous level,

07:33:24.140 --> 07:33:26.700
but I think the system and the process is stronger

07:33:27.260 --> 07:33:28.940
when there are checks and balances in place.

07:33:30.060 --> 07:33:31.740
And particularly in a case like this

07:33:31.740 --> 07:33:33.980
where there's, we're talking about redistricting,

07:33:37.340 --> 07:33:42.540
one particular motion may have one effect,

07:33:42.540 --> 07:33:45.180
but looking over time and over decades,

07:33:46.300 --> 07:33:47.900
several redistricting efforts

07:33:47.900 --> 07:33:51.020
could significantly increase community isolation

07:33:51.900 --> 07:33:54.540
and reduce opportunities for integration and diversity.

07:33:55.260 --> 07:33:57.740
And this morning, our student leaders spoke

07:33:57.740 --> 07:34:01.340
of that importance for them in their work,

07:34:02.140 --> 07:34:06.380
and the idea of modeling the inclusivity and community,

07:34:07.260 --> 07:34:09.180
and sometimes helping it be healthy

07:34:09.180 --> 07:34:10.540
to go to school with people

07:34:10.540 --> 07:34:13.260
that you don't spend time with outside of school,

07:34:13.260 --> 07:34:14.940
to have richer dialogue

07:34:14.940 --> 07:34:17.020
and have opportunities to see different perspectives

07:34:18.380 --> 07:34:20.780
can be, can have a great benefit.

07:34:21.980 --> 07:34:24.540
That being said, I think that

07:34:24.540 --> 07:34:28.540
the declining enrollment argument

07:34:30.460 --> 07:34:32.620
is a difficult one for me because it,

07:34:33.900 --> 07:34:35.900
Testen actually had a larger percent

07:34:35.900 --> 07:34:38.700
of declining enrollment than Orange did.

07:34:41.740 --> 07:34:44.540
And the racial diversity is somewhat,

07:34:46.860 --> 07:34:50.300
there are no thresholds set in Ed code,

07:34:50.300 --> 07:34:56.220
so there's some shifts in racial diversity,

07:34:56.220 --> 07:34:59.180
but one could argue that it's not significant.

07:34:59.820 --> 07:35:04.220
Where I do see more cause for concern

07:35:04.220 --> 07:35:08.300
is in the economic diversity proposed in the move.

07:35:08.300 --> 07:35:09.980
I think it was the previous slide, Larry,

07:35:09.980 --> 07:35:11.820
where we were looking at the percent of free

07:35:11.820 --> 07:35:17.980
and reduced lunch that was much more significant to me

07:35:17.980 --> 07:35:20.220
than the racial diversity component.

07:35:23.740 --> 07:35:25.180
And if you look at the school level,

07:35:25.180 --> 07:35:26.940
it's even more acute.

07:35:26.940 --> 07:35:28.300
It's more acute at the school level

07:35:28.300 --> 07:35:29.580
than it is at the district level.

07:35:30.380 --> 07:35:33.180
And I did want to mention that.

07:35:33.180 --> 07:35:34.540
And I also wanted to ask a question.

07:35:34.540 --> 07:35:38.460
I don't know if this is directed perhaps to Orange first,

07:35:38.460 --> 07:35:40.940
and then perhaps to somebody representing Testen,

07:35:40.940 --> 07:35:44.060
but one of the public comments

07:35:45.020 --> 07:35:50.380
were made about the timelines for requesting

07:35:51.100 --> 07:35:52.380
inter-district permits.

07:35:52.380 --> 07:35:55.260
And can somebody speak to that?

07:35:55.260 --> 07:35:57.660
If someone, I think one of the comments said that

07:35:59.020 --> 07:36:01.820
by the time you know if you're in to the others,

07:36:01.820 --> 07:36:02.940
because of the appeal process,

07:36:03.740 --> 07:36:05.420
I'm wondering if that's what the comment was about.

07:36:05.500 --> 07:36:17.100
I think part of it has to do with Testen Unified

07:36:17.100 --> 07:36:18.940
has moved up their timelines.

07:36:18.940 --> 07:36:21.580
They have a whole website dedicated

07:36:21.580 --> 07:36:23.580
to inter-district transfers,

07:36:23.580 --> 07:36:26.300
and they actually start as early as January.

07:36:27.020 --> 07:36:30.300
And that's very, very early to start accepting.

07:36:31.180 --> 07:36:33.900
It's not that we're trying to block or hold anybody back,

07:36:33.900 --> 07:36:36.140
but our process usually starts with,

07:36:36.140 --> 07:36:37.900
we're an open enrollment district.

07:36:37.900 --> 07:36:41.100
We allow students to move throughout the district.

07:36:41.100 --> 07:36:44.540
So we coincide that with our open enrollment process

07:36:44.540 --> 07:36:46.860
and inter-district transfer at the same time.

07:36:46.860 --> 07:36:49.820
So we ensure that we have an equitable process.

07:36:50.460 --> 07:36:53.340
And so ours is usually late February.

07:36:53.900 --> 07:36:57.660
So it's not that we're trying to in any way block anybody,

07:36:57.660 --> 07:36:59.660
but Testen does have a more aggressive,

07:37:00.540 --> 07:37:03.500
they have a website that explains how to do it.

07:37:04.060 --> 07:37:06.220
And it starts very early that they accept

07:37:06.220 --> 07:37:08.780
inter-district transfers very early in January.

07:37:11.260 --> 07:37:14.300
Regardless of the outcome of this today's motion,

07:37:14.300 --> 07:37:16.940
I think that might be something to take a look at locally.

07:37:17.580 --> 07:37:19.020
Just for the parents' sake,

07:37:19.020 --> 07:37:20.140
regardless of the vote,

07:37:20.140 --> 07:37:23.580
it would be to think about the timing of the process,

07:37:23.580 --> 07:37:25.820
because it can be very stressful for parents too.

07:37:26.380 --> 07:37:27.820
We'd be happy to do that.

07:37:27.820 --> 07:37:28.320
Thank you.

07:37:29.660 --> 07:37:32.060
Would I be able to jump in on that

07:37:32.060 --> 07:37:34.860
and explain it from the test in the parent perspective?

07:37:36.300 --> 07:37:36.800
Sure.

07:37:37.180 --> 07:37:37.740
Okay.

07:37:37.740 --> 07:37:41.580
So my students have been on transfer since kindergarten

07:37:41.580 --> 07:37:42.780
and they're now in sixth grade.

07:37:42.780 --> 07:37:45.500
So this process has taken a good amount of time.

07:37:46.220 --> 07:37:48.620
But when we first started the process,

07:37:48.620 --> 07:37:52.380
the test does have what's called an early transfer period

07:37:52.380 --> 07:37:54.220
that does open in January.

07:37:54.220 --> 07:37:56.940
And initially the process aligned with

07:37:56.940 --> 07:38:00.620
when the release forms were available from Orange Unified.

07:38:00.700 --> 07:38:03.660
We could apply for our release forms from Orange

07:38:03.660 --> 07:38:08.780
and submit in time to comply with Tustin's early decision.

07:38:08.780 --> 07:38:10.860
We didn't get a decision back from Tustin

07:38:10.860 --> 07:38:13.980
until later in the spring, maybe March or April.

07:38:13.980 --> 07:38:16.220
But we were allowed to submit that request early

07:38:16.220 --> 07:38:19.260
and we were able to get released from Orange at that time.

07:38:19.820 --> 07:38:22.620
Unfortunately, and the timing was exceptionally horrible

07:38:22.620 --> 07:38:24.460
because of the pandemic,

07:38:24.460 --> 07:38:28.540
in 2021, all of a sudden the release form

07:38:28.540 --> 07:38:30.380
wasn't available by Orange.

07:38:30.380 --> 07:38:33.420
We couldn't even get a release form to submit to Tustin

07:38:33.420 --> 07:38:36.620
until after February when their period had closed.

07:38:36.620 --> 07:38:40.060
And that was the first time that that transition had taken place

07:38:40.060 --> 07:38:44.540
and that shift in timeframe and that has continued ever since.

07:38:44.540 --> 07:38:46.700
So it's forced the families again,

07:38:46.700 --> 07:38:49.340
the anxiety and that stress and that annual process,

07:38:50.140 --> 07:38:52.460
you know, to have to submit to Tustin

07:38:52.460 --> 07:38:55.580
and basically, you know, beg them to hold a spot

07:38:55.580 --> 07:38:57.820
pending getting that release form in time

07:38:57.820 --> 07:38:59.660
for their decision process.

07:38:59.660 --> 07:39:01.820
Tustin is also an open enrollment district.

07:39:01.820 --> 07:39:03.660
They allow their students to participate

07:39:03.660 --> 07:39:07.420
to select which school they prefer to go to,

07:39:07.420 --> 07:39:08.780
whether it's their neighborhood school

07:39:08.780 --> 07:39:11.420
or the one across town based on those programs.

07:39:11.420 --> 07:39:13.900
So they have the exact same situation that Orange,

07:39:13.900 --> 07:39:15.980
but they have kept their process consistent.

07:39:15.980 --> 07:39:18.380
And again, right in the middle of the pandemic,

07:39:18.380 --> 07:39:21.980
in January of 2021, we were hit with this shift

07:39:21.980 --> 07:39:26.940
and misalignment in the transfer period or transfer dates.

07:39:26.940 --> 07:39:28.620
And I can't even tell you how many people,

07:39:30.300 --> 07:39:32.540
you know, just the emotional well-being of the kids,

07:39:32.540 --> 07:39:34.300
especially in that vulnerable time

07:39:34.300 --> 07:39:38.140
has just been astronomical and seriously detrimental.

07:39:38.140 --> 07:39:41.100
And to counter the superintendent's comments,

07:39:42.140 --> 07:39:44.060
I know dozens of families personally

07:39:44.060 --> 07:39:47.340
who have had appeals or requests for transfers denied

07:39:47.340 --> 07:39:50.300
with no reasons given just simply parents choice

07:39:50.300 --> 07:39:51.980
is not acceptable.

07:39:51.980 --> 07:39:54.780
And, you know, those parents were forced to find other

07:39:54.860 --> 07:39:57.180
either private schools or, you know,

07:39:57.180 --> 07:39:58.300
go through the appeal process,

07:39:58.300 --> 07:39:59.820
which again, is very stressful.

07:40:01.180 --> 07:40:03.020
Superintendent Hanson, but you did mention that

07:40:03.660 --> 07:40:05.900
after the appeal process, there haven't been any denied.

07:40:07.420 --> 07:40:08.700
That is correct.

07:40:08.700 --> 07:40:13.180
We do have an internal process where we ask our families

07:40:13.180 --> 07:40:16.620
to visit our schools, meet with principals,

07:40:16.620 --> 07:40:18.540
explore our educational programs,

07:40:18.540 --> 07:40:21.100
because we are very proud of them.

07:40:21.100 --> 07:40:22.780
But at the end of the day,

07:40:22.780 --> 07:40:27.020
we never deny an appeal to the Orange County School Board.

07:40:27.020 --> 07:40:29.500
We allow our parents to transfer.

07:40:29.500 --> 07:40:32.620
That's why we have 401 students in Tustin

07:40:32.620 --> 07:40:34.060
that we wish were with us.

07:40:34.060 --> 07:40:35.660
But, you know, that's what we do.

07:40:35.660 --> 07:40:38.460
We've always allowed our families to go.

07:40:38.460 --> 07:40:39.900
We can adjust the timelines.

07:40:39.900 --> 07:40:41.980
We're happy to look at that to make it easier

07:40:41.980 --> 07:40:44.140
so that families don't have stress.

07:40:44.140 --> 07:40:47.180
But Tustin, I'm looking at their website right now.

07:40:47.980 --> 07:40:51.660
Their transfer application period is a very short window.

07:40:51.660 --> 07:40:54.860
It's only January 9th through the 27th.

07:40:54.860 --> 07:40:59.420
It doesn't give us time to manage all our open enrollments.

07:40:59.420 --> 07:41:05.180
And we have several, over 400 ongoing continuing transfers

07:41:05.180 --> 07:41:06.060
that we continue to.

07:41:09.340 --> 07:41:11.100
Vice President Glover-Woods, it sounds like,

07:41:11.100 --> 07:41:14.060
looks like you want to come back in.

07:41:14.060 --> 07:41:15.340
Is that right?

07:41:15.420 --> 07:41:16.060
I do.

07:41:16.060 --> 07:41:17.580
Just one follow-up question.

07:41:19.180 --> 07:41:22.380
In hearing Superintendent Hanson's response,

07:41:22.940 --> 07:41:24.620
it led me to believe maybe I didn't ask

07:41:24.620 --> 07:41:27.500
my original question appropriately.

07:41:28.380 --> 07:41:30.380
When I was asking about the number

07:41:30.380 --> 07:41:35.180
of inter-district permits that were denied,

07:41:35.180 --> 07:41:38.220
I know you mentioned that none have been denied after appeal.

07:41:39.260 --> 07:41:42.220
Prior to appeal, how many have been denied?

07:41:45.820 --> 07:41:48.460
None of them have been denied.

07:41:48.460 --> 07:41:51.580
What we share with our parents is we have a process.

07:41:52.220 --> 07:41:54.060
We say, please look at our schools.

07:41:54.700 --> 07:41:57.900
And then our executive directors take them

07:41:57.900 --> 07:42:00.460
to visit our principals and the programs.

07:42:00.460 --> 07:42:02.940
And then they meet with the executive director.

07:42:02.940 --> 07:42:05.180
And if they still are not satisfied,

07:42:05.180 --> 07:42:07.260
they are not denied, they're allowed to go.

07:42:08.940 --> 07:42:10.860
So none have been denied internally.

07:42:11.500 --> 07:42:12.780
If they would like to move,

07:42:12.780 --> 07:42:14.540
they are allowed to move and transfer.

07:42:15.580 --> 07:42:17.100
So do they have to appeal?

07:42:18.140 --> 07:42:19.900
And I don't mean to beat this,

07:42:19.900 --> 07:42:22.060
but I'm trying to get clarification.

07:42:22.060 --> 07:42:26.620
There is a process where they would ask to speak

07:42:26.620 --> 07:42:30.540
with the executive director for their special circumstances.

07:42:30.540 --> 07:42:32.860
And there have been special circumstances

07:42:32.860 --> 07:42:33.820
which have been mentioned here,

07:42:34.460 --> 07:42:36.060
the mental health and the stress

07:42:36.060 --> 07:42:37.660
and the health of their children.

07:42:37.660 --> 07:42:39.020
And that's an automatic.

07:42:39.020 --> 07:42:40.460
They're allowed to go.

07:42:40.460 --> 07:42:41.500
They're allowed to transfer.

07:42:41.500 --> 07:42:45.900
I'm not sure I'm getting a clear answer,

07:42:45.900 --> 07:42:47.500
but it's okay.

07:42:47.500 --> 07:42:48.300
Thank you so much.

07:42:49.100 --> 07:42:51.340
I think we're wondering about the people

07:42:51.340 --> 07:42:52.620
who are not automatic.

07:42:52.620 --> 07:42:53.820
That's what we're wondering about.

07:42:59.980 --> 07:43:01.100
I think we're going to go ahead

07:43:01.100 --> 07:43:04.540
and move into a decision-making discussion

07:43:04.540 --> 07:43:05.660
probably at this point.

07:43:06.540 --> 07:43:09.820
I'd just like to share my thanks as well

07:43:09.820 --> 07:43:12.300
to all the folks who have called in.

07:43:12.300 --> 07:43:15.340
I understand parents' concerns

07:43:15.340 --> 07:43:16.620
about knowing from year to year

07:43:16.620 --> 07:43:18.860
whether children will go to school

07:43:18.860 --> 07:43:22.460
and the value of being able to walk up the street

07:43:22.460 --> 07:43:25.340
to your school and all of those things.

07:43:25.340 --> 07:43:27.900
I also, however, have the concerns

07:43:28.540 --> 07:43:30.700
that many of us have already raised.

07:43:31.420 --> 07:43:33.660
The slide that is up before us now

07:43:34.540 --> 07:43:36.620
demonstrates the very dramatic

07:43:36.620 --> 07:43:38.220
differentials of the school level

07:43:38.860 --> 07:43:42.300
for socioeconomically disadvantaged students

07:43:42.300 --> 07:43:46.300
and free and reduced price lunch student proportions

07:43:47.340 --> 07:43:51.580
if we were to approve this transfer of territory.

07:43:52.220 --> 07:43:56.380
So I think that's a very important part

07:43:56.380 --> 07:44:00.300
of the integration goal

07:44:01.020 --> 07:44:03.820
that is part of what we need to be looking at.

07:44:04.540 --> 07:44:07.180
So I just want to share that concern.

07:44:08.060 --> 07:44:11.500
And I also understand

07:44:11.500 --> 07:44:13.660
that one of the criteria is

07:44:14.300 --> 07:44:18.300
that it should not be primarily about real estate values.

07:44:18.300 --> 07:44:20.380
And I certainly understand

07:44:20.380 --> 07:44:22.540
that many parents are really looking for

07:44:23.260 --> 07:44:27.180
close proximity to their homes for their students.

07:44:27.180 --> 07:44:29.100
But we also heard testimony

07:44:29.100 --> 07:44:32.700
that there are real estate values at stake here

07:44:32.700 --> 07:44:38.300
that are driving some of the discussion in the community.

07:44:38.300 --> 07:44:41.260
So that is another concern that I have

07:44:42.220 --> 07:44:44.620
as the basis for approving this.

07:44:45.820 --> 07:44:46.940
I don't know if anybody else

07:44:46.940 --> 07:44:49.900
who has not had a chance to share their views

07:44:49.900 --> 07:44:53.980
wants to do so before we seek a motion.

07:44:55.980 --> 07:44:56.940
Member Rodriguez.

07:44:57.900 --> 07:45:02.940
Yes, I just want to say that as I'm reading a lot of this,

07:45:02.940 --> 07:45:08.140
I'm remembering 1976 East Palo Alto

07:45:08.140 --> 07:45:12.220
and how eventually the city was left without a high school.

07:45:14.140 --> 07:45:17.660
And as I'm reading everything

07:45:17.660 --> 07:45:20.140
and listening to both the petitioners and the appellants,

07:45:20.860 --> 07:45:22.460
I keep thinking about that.

07:45:22.460 --> 07:45:26.540
And I really haven't found a substantial claim

07:45:26.540 --> 07:45:30.620
for this reorganization.

07:45:30.620 --> 07:45:32.620
And I do also want to thank everyone,

07:45:34.860 --> 07:45:36.780
the CTE for all of their work on this.

07:45:38.220 --> 07:45:40.060
But those are my concerns.

07:45:41.500 --> 07:45:41.900
Thank you.

07:45:41.900 --> 07:45:43.260
Member Petillo-Bronson.

07:45:44.940 --> 07:45:49.100
Yeah, I also find this slide pretty troubling.

07:45:49.820 --> 07:45:53.180
The disparities in terms of the different school districts

07:45:53.260 --> 07:45:56.860
and school sites are not terribly subtle.

07:45:58.860 --> 07:46:03.180
And I think the language that's actually in the CTE motion

07:46:04.700 --> 07:46:09.260
effectively that there's no compelling reason

07:46:09.260 --> 07:46:10.940
to transfer the territory,

07:46:10.940 --> 07:46:13.420
but no compelling reason enough

07:46:13.420 --> 07:46:16.220
to reverse the county committee's approval

07:46:16.220 --> 07:46:17.660
of the territory transfer.

07:46:18.380 --> 07:46:23.660
I think the slide actually offers an alternative vision

07:46:23.660 --> 07:46:26.940
of what might be compelling enough to reverse.

07:46:27.740 --> 07:46:33.260
And then we'll be just last thing I'll lift up is,

07:46:33.260 --> 07:46:38.300
I think Carl Cohn during the public comment,

07:46:38.300 --> 07:46:40.620
I think raised the specter of what this means

07:46:40.620 --> 07:46:41.580
in terms of precedent

07:46:42.300 --> 07:46:50.860
and also how future boundary changes might be viewed.

07:46:51.420 --> 07:46:53.740
And I think that is significant

07:46:53.740 --> 07:46:55.420
and something we have to keep in mind as well.

07:46:57.420 --> 07:46:59.260
I thank you for that.

07:47:01.100 --> 07:47:03.500
And I guess as I seek a motion,

07:47:03.500 --> 07:47:09.020
I want to also agree with member Yoshimoto-Towery

07:47:09.020 --> 07:47:11.900
that it sounds like aligning and smoothing

07:47:11.900 --> 07:47:17.260
the transfer processes may be more helpful

07:47:17.260 --> 07:47:20.140
than transferring this territory

07:47:21.100 --> 07:47:22.460
from one district to another.

07:47:23.100 --> 07:47:25.820
Member Rodriguez, are you wanting to raise your hand again

07:47:25.820 --> 07:47:27.500
or is it still up from before?

07:47:32.620 --> 07:47:33.740
I was being handy.

07:47:34.700 --> 07:47:35.200
Okay.

07:47:36.160 --> 07:47:40.720
So I'd like to see if there is a motion.

07:47:41.520 --> 07:47:43.120
Hearing the sense of the board,

07:47:43.120 --> 07:47:47.360
we may want a motion to deny the transfer.

07:47:47.920 --> 07:47:51.520
But if we have a different motion,

07:47:51.520 --> 07:47:54.800
I would take whichever one you want to offer.

07:47:56.960 --> 07:47:58.320
I wonder, Dr. Hammond,

07:47:59.280 --> 07:48:05.520
what would the wording be if we deny this transfer

07:48:05.520 --> 07:48:09.200
so that we can follow the legal parameters

07:48:09.200 --> 07:48:11.360
on these type of transfers?

07:48:12.000 --> 07:48:15.840
I think I'm going to ask our executive director,

07:48:15.840 --> 07:48:18.240
but no findings are needed.

07:48:18.240 --> 07:48:19.760
So I think all we would need to say

07:48:19.760 --> 07:48:23.360
is that we do not affirm the actions

07:48:23.360 --> 07:48:26.560
of the county committee to approve the proposal.

07:48:27.280 --> 07:48:34.160
But let me ask executive director Brooks Allen

07:48:34.160 --> 07:48:37.920
if he or our chief counsel, Judy Sias,

07:48:37.920 --> 07:48:40.720
if they would want to word it a particularly different way.

07:48:41.440 --> 07:48:44.880
So with the caveat that I'm waiting for Ms. Shari

07:48:44.880 --> 07:48:46.960
to correct me if I'm wrong is I understand

07:48:46.960 --> 07:48:48.880
the motion would be to deny the transfer.

07:48:49.920 --> 07:48:52.080
Well, the actions that the education code

07:48:52.080 --> 07:48:54.800
gives the state board decided to affirm the actions,

07:48:55.600 --> 07:48:59.760
which is what we've listed here as our recommendation.

07:49:00.480 --> 07:49:03.280
The motion would be to reverse the actions.

07:49:04.960 --> 07:49:06.880
So that's the wording that we need.

07:49:08.320 --> 07:49:11.440
And you wouldn't have an electionary issue

07:49:11.440 --> 07:49:13.440
because if you reverse the actions,

07:49:13.440 --> 07:49:14.640
there will be no election.

07:49:17.280 --> 07:49:20.320
Okay, member Escobedo, does that answer your question?

07:49:20.320 --> 07:49:21.120
Yes, it does.

07:49:21.120 --> 07:49:23.680
And I would like to move to reverse the actions

07:49:23.680 --> 07:49:26.720
of the county committee to approve the proposal

07:49:26.720 --> 07:49:31.360
to transfer territory from Orange USD to Tustin USD.

07:49:32.720 --> 07:49:35.520
And do I have a second on that proposal?

07:49:37.280 --> 07:49:37.680
Thank you.

07:49:38.960 --> 07:49:40.560
We have second, third, and fourth,

07:49:41.760 --> 07:49:43.840
but I think I saw member Rodriguez first.

07:49:46.160 --> 07:49:47.920
Is there any further discussion of the motion?

07:49:49.840 --> 07:49:53.360
Okay, then I'll ask Brooks Allen to call the roll for the vote.

07:49:54.000 --> 07:49:55.040
President Darling-Hammond.

07:49:56.320 --> 07:49:56.820
Aye.

07:49:57.600 --> 07:49:58.480
Member Escobedo.

07:49:59.840 --> 07:50:00.340
Aye.

07:50:00.800 --> 07:50:02.000
Vice President Glover-Woods.

07:50:03.280 --> 07:50:03.780
Yes.

07:50:04.240 --> 07:50:04.880
Member Lewis.

07:50:06.080 --> 07:50:06.580
Yes.

07:50:06.960 --> 07:50:07.840
Member McQuillan.

07:50:09.120 --> 07:50:09.620
Aye.

07:50:10.080 --> 07:50:10.800
Member Olken.

07:50:12.320 --> 07:50:12.820
Yes.

07:50:13.440 --> 07:50:14.800
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

07:50:15.920 --> 07:50:16.420
Aye.

07:50:16.960 --> 07:50:18.080
Member Petillo-Brownson.

07:50:19.040 --> 07:50:19.540
Yes.

07:50:20.000 --> 07:50:20.720
Member Porter.

07:50:21.840 --> 07:50:22.340
Yes.

07:50:22.820 --> 07:50:23.700
Member Rodriguez.

07:50:24.980 --> 07:50:25.480
Yes.

07:50:26.180 --> 07:50:27.460
Member Yoshimoto-Taurin.

07:50:28.580 --> 07:50:29.080
Yes.

07:50:29.780 --> 07:50:31.140
The motion carries unanimously.

07:50:33.140 --> 07:50:33.700
Thank you.

07:50:34.580 --> 07:50:37.620
That was a long and important discussion

07:50:37.620 --> 07:50:39.940
and, you know, I think we want to reaffirm

07:50:41.300 --> 07:50:43.540
both the intentions of the board

07:50:43.540 --> 07:50:47.940
and the desire that the transfer process be smooth

07:50:48.900 --> 07:50:52.740
and unstressful for parents who need it,

07:50:52.740 --> 07:50:57.860
but also that we retain the orders of the district as they stand.

07:50:58.660 --> 07:51:00.980
I am going to postpone until tomorrow.

07:51:01.700 --> 07:51:04.420
I want to thank Larry for all of your diligent work

07:51:04.420 --> 07:51:05.620
and for your presentation.

07:51:06.260 --> 07:51:09.700
I'm going to postpone reopening item one until tomorrow

07:51:10.500 --> 07:51:12.820
since we are already at 530

07:51:12.820 --> 07:51:17.540
and we've had some very meaty conversations today.

07:51:18.020 --> 07:51:22.820
I do want to go ahead and take the moment now for public comment

07:51:22.820 --> 07:51:25.540
because if there are any public commenters waiting,

07:51:25.540 --> 07:51:27.540
they are expecting that to happen today.

07:51:28.260 --> 07:51:30.740
So if you could put the public comment slide up.

07:51:31.860 --> 07:51:33.700
For general public comment,

07:51:33.700 --> 07:51:38.020
this is invited on any matter not included on the printed agenda.

07:51:38.020 --> 07:51:41.380
Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item

07:51:41.380 --> 07:51:44.580
may do so by calling the number shown on the public comment slide,

07:51:45.540 --> 07:51:47.620
state your name and affiliation for the record,

07:51:47.620 --> 07:51:50.340
remember to turn down the volume on your computer.

07:51:50.340 --> 07:51:52.340
If you're following the live feed,

07:51:52.340 --> 07:51:54.340
speakers will be limited to one minute each.

07:51:55.300 --> 07:51:57.380
And so we'll give a little bit of wait time

07:51:57.380 --> 07:52:01.060
to see if there is anyone queuing up for public comment.

07:52:02.340 --> 07:52:04.500
Take a moment and breathe.

07:52:04.500 --> 07:52:17.780
Do we have any public comment?

07:52:19.700 --> 07:52:21.380
We do have one caller in the queue.

07:52:21.380 --> 07:52:22.660
I will open up the phone line now.

07:52:23.460 --> 07:52:23.860
Thank you.

07:52:25.460 --> 07:52:26.100
Good afternoon.

07:52:26.100 --> 07:52:28.420
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

07:52:28.420 --> 07:52:29.140
You have one minute.

07:52:29.140 --> 07:52:31.380
Your time starts now.

07:52:34.500 --> 07:52:37.620
Thank you.

07:52:37.620 --> 07:52:40.260
Caller with the last four digits 7684,

07:52:40.260 --> 07:52:41.060
you are now live.

07:52:41.060 --> 07:52:42.420
Please start your public comment.

07:52:45.860 --> 07:52:46.260
Okay.

07:52:46.260 --> 07:52:49.540
Hearing none, that concludes public comment

07:52:49.540 --> 07:52:51.540
for general public comment.

07:52:52.980 --> 07:52:53.380
All right.

07:52:53.380 --> 07:52:54.180
Thank you very much.

07:52:54.180 --> 07:52:57.460
Tomorrow morning, the state board will meet in closed session

07:52:57.460 --> 07:53:01.380
to discuss and or take action on the following legal matter,

07:53:01.380 --> 07:53:02.740
MSC versus state.

07:53:03.380 --> 07:53:07.380
I hereby continue the meeting and end today's session

07:53:07.380 --> 07:53:09.060
at 5 34 p.m.

07:53:09.060 --> 07:53:10.740
And look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

07:53:11.460 --> 07:53:12.260
Have a good evening.

07:53:13.700 --> 07:53:14.660
All right, everyone.

07:53:16.260 --> 07:53:19.460
Night.
