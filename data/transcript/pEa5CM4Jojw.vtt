00:00.000 --> 00:12.720
Good morning. We're reconvening for the January 13th, 14th, 2021 state board meeting. First

00:12.720 --> 00:17.920
announcement for public input. Members of the public wishing to dial in for public comments

00:17.920 --> 00:22.360
should view the live stream of the meeting to know at what time we will ask for public

00:22.360 --> 00:27.320
comment for each item on the agenda. Public comment may be provided by dialing the phone

00:27.320 --> 00:34.000
number and participant access code, then following each of the operator's prompts. Upon dialing in,

00:34.000 --> 00:39.320
callers will be added to a caller queue. The operator will notify callers when it is their

00:39.320 --> 00:45.160
turn to provide public comment. We will also ask the public calling in for public comment to please

00:45.160 --> 00:50.840
turn down the speaker volume of their computers if they are following the live feed to avoid an

00:50.840 --> 00:56.920
echoing effect. Public comment will be limited to one minute for each speaker, and board members

00:56.920 --> 01:02.120
please mute your microphones when not speaking and keep your cameras on at all times except during

01:02.120 --> 01:07.640
the scheduled breaks to ensure that we maintain a quorum throughout today's virtual meeting. For

01:07.640 --> 01:12.920
each item on the agenda, there will be an opportunity for you board members to raise your hand using the

01:12.920 --> 01:17.960
zoom participant window if you would like to ask a question or make a comment. And we're going to

01:17.960 --> 01:23.720
go to item 16, which is the state annual performance report for part B of the individuals with

01:23.720 --> 01:33.000
disabilities education act of 2004 covering program year 2019 to 2020. I just need to take

01:33.000 --> 01:39.880
role to establish a quorum. Okay, thank you. So we're going to change it up. We'll go reverse

01:39.880 --> 01:51.000
order from yesterday just to keep things lively. So member Burr. He's here. I usually see member

01:51.000 --> 01:56.200
Burr representatives here and we will work on the mute function. Now they got me unmuted. I am here.

01:56.200 --> 02:01.640
All right, excellent. President Darling-Hammond. Here. Member Fatah.

02:04.840 --> 02:16.440
Here. Member Glover-Woods. Here. Member McQuillan. Here. Member Navo. Here. Member Patil-Brownson.

02:16.440 --> 02:28.920
Here. Good morning. Morning. Member Rodriguez. Here. Member Rucker. I am here. Vice President

02:28.920 --> 02:38.440
Strauss. Here. Member Son. Here. Everyone's present. Quorum's established. All right.

02:39.160 --> 02:44.200
We will now move on with agenda item 16, which is the state annual performance report for part

02:44.200 --> 02:51.000
B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004 covering the program year 2019-20.

02:51.960 --> 02:56.600
The CDE recommends the state board review and approve the executive summary of the

02:57.160 --> 03:04.200
fiscal year 2019 annual performance report for part B of IDEA as prepared by the special education

03:04.200 --> 03:10.520
division and the item will be presented by Heather Kalamis of the CDE. Heather recently

03:10.520 --> 03:15.720
joined the department in August 2020 taking on the role of special education director.

03:16.440 --> 03:21.080
This is her first meeting presenting before the board, so I'd like to welcome Heather.

03:23.800 --> 03:30.680
Great. Thank you so much, Linda Darling-Hammond, and good morning, SBE board members. It's an honor

03:30.680 --> 03:36.280
and a pleasure to be with you here today to discuss the annual performance report. I myself,

03:36.280 --> 03:41.080
along with Shiloh Duncan-Bessarreal, will be co-presenting and presenting the annual

03:41.080 --> 03:45.560
performance report to you here this morning and looking forward to the conversation.

03:47.320 --> 03:52.440
As board member Darling-Hammond stated previously, I most previously come from

03:52.440 --> 03:56.840
the Illinois State Board of Education as the former state director of special education

03:56.840 --> 04:01.800
and also the executive director of programs which oversaw the special education

04:01.800 --> 04:07.160
multilingual and early childhood departments. Prior to that, I'm a lifelong special educator.

04:07.160 --> 04:13.080
I've been a paraprofessional, a teacher, a special education administrator, and it's been such a joy

04:13.080 --> 04:19.800
and such an honor to join an amazing team here at the California Department of Education, so

04:19.800 --> 04:31.720
thank you all. Next slide. And in terms of my philosophy and approach to special education,

04:31.720 --> 04:38.920
I believe that we must ensure that our systems and structures are aligned to values and beliefs

04:38.920 --> 04:44.440
that support and elevate the student experience, which is also a human experience, and that special

04:44.440 --> 04:50.120
education provides opportunities. And really, to steal from Tom Hare, who I'm a big fan of,

04:50.120 --> 04:56.120
is to minimize the impact of the disability and maximize outcomes for students. And all along the

04:56.120 --> 05:04.360
way, it's a goal and an approach to build upon the brilliance that lies within each of our students

05:04.360 --> 05:11.640
as well. And so I think the role of the special education within the California Department of

05:11.640 --> 05:17.400
Education is to obviously fulfill our various federal and state requirements in terms of

05:17.400 --> 05:23.080
general supervision, but also I'm looking for our division to support, empower, and embolden our

05:23.080 --> 05:29.240
LEAs to relentlessly and collaboratively seek solutions that positively impact students, families,

05:29.240 --> 05:37.560
and communities. And there's a slide a little bit later that digs a little bit deeper into the APR,

05:37.560 --> 05:43.240
but just a brief overview here is that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act,

05:43.240 --> 05:48.920
or IDEA, requires each state to develop a state performance plan every six years and then

05:49.880 --> 05:55.800
subsequently provide an annual performance report on targets that evaluate the state's efforts to

05:55.800 --> 06:02.040
implement the requirements of IDEA across the state. And so obviously, this is our annual update

06:02.600 --> 06:10.040
that will be submitted to OSEP upon approval. OSEP determines and uses data within the APR

06:10.040 --> 06:16.200
to make annual determinations for each state, typically around June or July. And those sort

06:16.280 --> 06:23.560
of categories that states are designated as meeting requirements, needing assistance,

06:23.560 --> 06:28.760
needing intervention, or needing substantial intervention. And so just a historical note

06:28.760 --> 06:34.920
is that the state of California has been in the needs assistance category since 2015. So

06:35.800 --> 06:41.800
2015 to 2020, California has been designated as a needs assistance state, which just means that

06:42.600 --> 06:47.800
the Office of Special Education Programs and the U.S. Department of Education do provide

06:48.360 --> 06:53.320
technical assistance and opportunities for enhanced support to improve special education

06:53.320 --> 07:03.480
programming. So to provide you a brief overview of the landscape of students with disabilities in

07:03.480 --> 07:10.840
California, during the 2019 and 2020 school year, there were just north of 804,000 students with

07:10.840 --> 07:16.440
disabilities ages 0 to 22 that were served in the California public school system.

07:17.960 --> 07:23.640
Of that, there were just north of 752,000 that are K-12 students with disabilities,

07:23.640 --> 07:30.840
which represent just a little over 12% of the total percent of California student population,

07:30.840 --> 07:35.000
which is just over six million. And to put that in perspective, in that same,

07:35.720 --> 07:43.320
in that actually the 2018-2019 school year on a national landscape, the national average is

07:43.320 --> 07:51.000
roughly around 14%. So California is in that ballpark range of averages in terms of supporting

07:51.000 --> 07:58.760
students with disabilities. Next slide. In terms of enrollment over time, really within the past

07:58.760 --> 08:04.040
decade, as you can see here, well the font may be a little bit small, the population of students

08:04.040 --> 08:14.360
with disabilities across the state of California has risen in 2009 at around 10%. And then in the

08:14.360 --> 08:22.920
2019-2020 school year, again, looking at 12% over time. So it paints a pretty interesting picture

08:22.920 --> 08:28.360
of the trajectory and the growth of students with disabilities in the state of California. Next slide.

08:29.000 --> 08:36.360
In terms of students with disabilities listed by categorical designation in 2019 and 2020,

08:36.920 --> 08:42.280
here we see a spread that's typical of many states and reflects sort of a national

08:42.280 --> 08:49.000
sort of a percentage of data, or I'm sorry, categorical designations of students with

08:49.000 --> 08:55.800
disabilities in specific designations or categories. And so SLD, or specific

08:55.800 --> 09:03.160
learning disabilities, are a category that has the most amount of students identified,

09:03.160 --> 09:09.000
at roughly 37%, followed by speech-language impairment, autism, other health impairment,

09:09.000 --> 09:14.520
or known as OHI, and then intellectual disability. And again, this is typical in terms of a

09:14.520 --> 09:21.720
distribution at the national landscape as well. In terms of students that are socially

09:21.880 --> 09:27.880
economically disadvantaged, that also have an IEP in 2019-2020, here we see that 13%

09:28.680 --> 09:32.200
of students that also carry that designation also have an IEP as well.

09:34.840 --> 09:40.600
In terms of foster youth with IEPs in that same year, here we see a little bit bigger number of

09:40.600 --> 09:46.760
27% of students that are designated as foster youth also have an IEP as well.

09:47.720 --> 09:54.600
And in terms of English learners that have IEPs within the 2019-2020 school year, again,

09:54.600 --> 10:03.880
we are sitting right at 17%. And then percent of students with IEPs in one or more of the LCFF

10:03.880 --> 10:11.720
student groups, here we see that roughly 70% of our students with IEPs are in one or more

10:11.720 --> 10:18.520
roughly 70% of our students with IEPs are in one or more of the LCFF student groups as well.

10:21.480 --> 10:26.120
And so again, just as a piggyback off of what I discussed a little bit earlier,

10:26.120 --> 10:32.200
again, the APR has very specific instructions in terms of how it's prepared in terms of

10:33.480 --> 10:38.040
information that is required to be submitted to the ED. Again, the state board must approve.

10:38.680 --> 10:44.360
There are 17 indicators located in the annual performance report. And those are either

10:44.360 --> 10:49.800
categorized as compliance and performance. And then there's one that is both considered

10:49.800 --> 10:56.360
compliance and performance. And so the targets for the compliance indicators are set by OSEP at either

10:56.360 --> 11:01.720
zero or 100. And then the targets for the performance indicators are set in collaboration

11:02.680 --> 11:11.800
with various groups here in terms of setting those targets, collaborating collectively across

11:11.800 --> 11:17.720
the state. And so such as those targets will be submitted to the state board of education later

11:17.720 --> 11:23.400
this year for discussion and approval as well. And it's important to note that our state

11:23.400 --> 11:31.000
performance plan and those targets will run through 2019-2020. And so we'll be developing

11:31.800 --> 11:35.480
an additional round of targets again with stakeholder collaboration.

11:42.120 --> 11:46.440
And then in terms of just data years, I think it's important to know, and I know Shiloh will also

11:48.040 --> 11:53.160
echo this as well, is that this current APR that you're seeing today reflects data that

11:53.160 --> 11:58.760
was collected during federal fiscal year 2019. And so this is actually equivalent to California

11:58.760 --> 12:06.200
school year 2019-2020. It is important to note that certain indicators like graduation dropout,

12:06.200 --> 12:11.320
suspension, and expulsion are indicators that are reported in lag years. So again,

12:11.320 --> 12:19.960
the data that you're seeing is from school year 2018 and 2019. Next slide. And in terms of where

12:19.960 --> 12:25.480
did this data come from? Well, the data that is collected from a variety of sources, CALPADS being

12:25.480 --> 12:31.400
one, the Office of Administrative Hearings second, and then the California Assessment of Student

12:31.400 --> 12:40.280
Performance in Progress or CASP. And in this point, just because the CASP is not actually

12:41.640 --> 12:47.320
applicable in this submission because of the federal requirements for testing were waived

12:47.320 --> 12:54.120
at this point in time. So I will now pass it over to my colleague, Shiloh Duncan-Vessarille,

12:54.120 --> 12:58.760
who will take us through an overview of the compliance indicators and then an overview of

12:58.760 --> 13:05.160
the performance indicators. Good morning, board members. It's so lovely to see you virtually,

13:05.960 --> 13:11.400
although I'm seeing some familiar faces and some new faces. So for those of you who do not know me,

13:11.400 --> 13:15.640
my name is Shiloh Duncan-Vessarille. I'm the data administrator for special education.

13:15.640 --> 13:20.200
So my primary goal is to collect and report on all students with disabilities in California.

13:20.920 --> 13:26.600
I've been here before talking about our annual performance report. And so I wanted to walk you

13:26.600 --> 13:31.080
through the report. If you've gotten a chance to look at the actual item itself, you'll notice

13:31.080 --> 13:35.800
there are 17 indicators. I will not be going through each indicator today. Thankfully,

13:35.800 --> 13:40.680
I know it's quite early for that kind of data dive. We're going to be selecting some of the

13:40.680 --> 13:45.240
indicators, but I'm happy to answer questions on any indicators that are in the item.

13:46.280 --> 13:55.720
As Heather spoke to, we do have data that's coming from 2019 and 2019-20 and 2018-19.

13:55.720 --> 14:02.600
It's important to note, though, that this data doesn't always reflect the full year of 2019-20.

14:02.600 --> 14:09.720
We do know that COVID school site closures were impacting the data. And so the data you are

14:09.720 --> 14:14.600
going to see, most of it is actually going to come from the fall of 2019. And so that's prior

14:14.600 --> 14:20.920
to COVID school site closures. Something to note for future years is that we do believe that

14:20.920 --> 14:27.560
the impact of both COVID school site closures and also learning loss will be impacted on the

14:27.560 --> 14:31.960
annual performance report for multiple years to come, at least two or three years.

14:33.400 --> 14:36.360
So something to keep in mind, because we have laggier data.

14:36.360 --> 14:46.520
So I'm going to start with the compliance indicators. It's important to note that

14:46.520 --> 14:54.840
compliance indicators have a target of either 0% or 100%. We don't set these targets as a state.

14:54.840 --> 15:01.160
They are given to us by the Office of Special Education Programs at the U.S. Department of

15:01.160 --> 15:06.040
Education, and we cannot change them. And they're very difficult to meet. You'll notice we get close

15:06.120 --> 15:11.880
on a few indicators, but we never meet the actual target itself. But there I think are some positive

15:11.880 --> 15:18.440
things that we're going to be pointing out in these sets of indicators. So I'd like to start

15:18.440 --> 15:23.320
with indicator 4B, suspension expulsion rate by race and ethnicity. I always like to start with

15:23.320 --> 15:30.200
this indicator in part because it is an indicator that sounds like other types of indicators,

15:30.200 --> 15:35.800
but is actually very different. So indicator 4B is actually a disproportionality indicator, meaning

15:35.800 --> 15:41.720
we're looking at suspension and expulsion rate by race and ethnicity. And while we are looking at

15:41.720 --> 15:46.040
suspension expulsion, we are looking at the cumulative number of days that a student is

15:46.040 --> 15:51.000
suspended or expelled greater than 10 days. So if a student is expelled greater than 10 days

15:51.000 --> 15:57.320
cumulatively through the year, they are counted as part of this calculation. And the LEA, we count

15:57.320 --> 16:02.840
the total number of those instances by the LEA and compare it by the composition of race and ethnicity.

16:03.640 --> 16:09.160
So it's also important to note the reason that this is a compliance indicator is that calculation

16:09.160 --> 16:15.000
is just the first step. What we do then is we identify districts that do have some significant

16:15.000 --> 16:20.120
discrepancy in race and ethnicity for suspension and expulsion, and then we dig deeper inside of

16:20.120 --> 16:25.720
their policies, practices, and procedures. And if we find instances of non-compliance, those are the

16:25.720 --> 16:33.240
representation that you see in the percentage here. So around 4% of LEAs that we identified that

16:33.240 --> 16:38.760
had significant discrepancy also had non-compliance that we follow up with to ensure that there isn't

16:38.760 --> 16:45.960
non-compliant policies and procedures. Of course, we did not meet the 0% requirement in this indicator.

16:45.960 --> 16:53.960
We were pretty close at 0.79%. Indicator 9 is another disproportionate representation indicator.

16:53.960 --> 16:58.040
We look at disproportionate representation overall in this indicator. So does the

16:58.040 --> 17:03.960
identification of all students with disabilities differ in composition of race and ethnicity

17:03.960 --> 17:09.240
compared to the composition of race and ethnicity for the entire district? As you can see here,

17:09.240 --> 17:15.080
this is very similar to the indicator 4B, where we are again identifying a district that has

17:15.080 --> 17:19.400
disproportionate representation, and then we're digging deeper into their policies, practices,

17:19.400 --> 17:24.440
and procedures to determine if there are non-compliances. And in this case, we found

17:24.440 --> 17:32.920
about 2% of districts had disproportionate representation. Again, we did not meet the

17:32.920 --> 17:41.080
target at about 2%. It's also important to note that we did increase the number of districts by

17:41.080 --> 17:48.280
0.45% compared to the previous year who had non-compliance policies, practices, and procedures.

17:49.160 --> 17:54.760
Finally, disproportionate representation by disability, that's again looking at the number

17:54.760 --> 18:00.200
of students who are identified for special education by the disability type and comparing

18:00.200 --> 18:05.720
the composition of race and ethnicity to what we expect in the composition of race and ethnicity

18:05.720 --> 18:11.800
in the entire district. We found about 14% of those districts we flagged as having disproportionate

18:11.800 --> 18:16.440
representation by disability as having non-compliant policies, practices, and procedures,

18:16.440 --> 18:23.800
and that's an increase of about 4.2% from the previous year. We are again always refining the

18:23.800 --> 18:30.200
number of items that we identify and we look at when we dig deeper into a district, and we did

18:30.200 --> 18:34.280
increase the number of items that we looked at this year, so that could potentially account for

18:34.280 --> 18:41.320
the increase of 4.2%. I do also like to take a moment here to talk about disproportionality and

18:41.320 --> 18:46.600
also significant disproportionality, and for those of you who've been with us for a little

18:46.600 --> 18:50.840
while, you'll remember our many conversations about this, but for those of you that are new,

18:50.840 --> 18:55.560
I'd like to walk you through how we sort of got here in terms of disproportionality and

18:55.560 --> 19:01.000
significant disproportionality. Both of these elements are required elements within IDA for

19:01.000 --> 19:06.840
us to ensure that there isn't disproportionate identification of students for race ethnicity,

19:07.800 --> 19:13.480
by race ethnicity, for identification, for suspension, expulsion, and also for

19:14.760 --> 19:21.320
placement. Prior to 2016, states could use any kind of calculation they wanted,

19:22.120 --> 19:28.760
and we used a sort of a mix of two calculations. In 2016, the U.S. certification changed the

19:28.760 --> 19:35.320
regulation and required the use of a single calculation called the risk ratio to make these

19:35.400 --> 19:41.000
determinations. It also required the state to set a minimum end size, a minimum cell size,

19:41.000 --> 19:46.920
and to define recent progress. We applied the new methodology to disproportionality

19:47.800 --> 19:54.120
starting in 2016-17, and the reason I bring this up is because disproportionality that you see here

19:54.120 --> 19:59.480
in the annual performance report today is just a one-year calculation. The significant

19:59.480 --> 20:04.360
disproportionality looks at multiple years. One of the things that we did in California, though,

20:04.360 --> 20:10.120
was we applied the same methodology to both the one-year disproportionate calculation that we do

20:10.120 --> 20:15.400
within the annual performance report and inside of the three-year calculation for significant

20:15.400 --> 20:23.000
disproportionality because we wanted districts to use the time between year one and year three

20:23.000 --> 20:29.720
to really look at their practices, their policies, any sort of trainings, any sort of work that they

20:29.720 --> 20:36.760
wanted to to reduce the impact of disproportionality and to reduce the possibility that would become

20:36.760 --> 20:41.720
significantly disproportionate because there is an additional level of enforcement that occurs when

20:41.720 --> 20:48.200
a district becomes significantly disproportionate. For this school year, so FFY 2019, we identified

20:48.200 --> 20:54.840
332 LEAs who were found to be disproportionate in that one-year calculation and 111 LEAs who

20:54.840 --> 21:01.240
were significantly disproportionate, and it should be noted that is an increase in the number of

21:01.960 --> 21:07.880
districts that we identified in previous calculations prior to 2016-17. The reason for

21:07.880 --> 21:14.040
that is because I should note that the risk ratio is a single calculation that is also very

21:15.560 --> 21:21.960
sensitive to size, and so we've worked with US Smart Education to sort of minimize that impact,

21:21.960 --> 21:26.840
but we are identifying more districts as being both disproportionate and significantly disproportionate.

21:28.360 --> 21:32.760
So when we talk about disproportionality and significant disproportionality, it's important

21:32.760 --> 21:37.880
to understand that what you see in the annual performance report today is the disproportionality

21:37.880 --> 21:42.840
one-year calculation. Again, we flag districts and we do a compliance review to dig a little bit

21:42.840 --> 21:47.400
deeper into their policies, practices, and procedures. After three years of the district

21:47.560 --> 21:53.320
disproportionate in the same indicator, then there's fiscal implications. So what we do is

21:53.320 --> 21:59.000
we set aside 15 percent of their federal funds for IDEA and they're required to develop an

21:59.000 --> 22:05.400
improvement plan. And so why it was really important for us to ensure that we had a step

22:05.400 --> 22:10.360
process for districts and disproportionality and to adopt the same calculation for both

22:10.360 --> 22:15.080
disproportionality and significant disproportionality is because we wanted disproportionality, the

22:15.080 --> 22:20.040
one-year calculation, to act as an early warning system for significant disproportionality for

22:20.040 --> 22:25.800
LEAs. As such, the first two years, the districts would potentially identify root cause and change

22:25.800 --> 22:30.920
their practices, but if they did not change their practices, then they would have that impact of

22:31.480 --> 22:38.440
fiscal consequence. And that's that 111 districts that are in significant disproportionality this

22:38.440 --> 22:45.560
year. I'm also going to overview the performance indicators. Again, there's a number of performance

22:45.560 --> 22:49.480
indicators. I will not be overviewing every single one of them. We're just going to select

22:49.480 --> 22:53.400
some of them to go through, but I'm happy to answer any questions about the individual

22:53.400 --> 23:03.080
indicators in the item. So I do have this information here in both the item and here,

23:03.080 --> 23:07.560
and it's important to note the things that we identified in this item is we identified the

23:07.560 --> 23:13.240
target, the result, whether or not we met the target, and the change. And the reason I wanted

23:13.240 --> 23:17.640
to show you all this and talk a little bit about it is because, as Heather spoke about earlier,

23:17.640 --> 23:23.960
we will be coming back to you sometime later this year, in the fall likely, to walk through

23:23.960 --> 23:30.920
our targets that we've worked with our stakeholder group on and sort of walk through each individual

23:31.880 --> 23:35.000
performance indicator, look at the target that the stakeholders have

23:35.880 --> 23:41.160
recommended, and then move forward with your recommendations so that we can submit it to the

23:41.160 --> 23:51.320
U.S. Department of Education in February of 2022. So I would normally bring our assessment indicator,

23:51.320 --> 23:56.920
which is indicator three to you all, but as you know, due to COVID-19 and school site closures

23:56.920 --> 24:01.640
around the state of California, the city suspended statewide testing. There is no assessment data

24:01.640 --> 24:07.160
for 2019-20, and we will not be submitting data for this indicator. We also received a waiver from

24:07.160 --> 24:12.120
the U.S. Department of Education that did not require us to submit the data for this indicator.

24:12.120 --> 24:15.720
All states receive this waiver, so there will be no statewide data for any state

24:17.000 --> 24:22.920
submitted in their annual performance report. So again, talking about suspension expulsion,

24:23.880 --> 24:28.760
when Heather talked about there's one indicator that is both compliance and performance,

24:28.760 --> 24:35.640
it's suspension and expulsion, and so this one looks at how many students are being

24:35.640 --> 24:41.640
suspended or expelled greater than 10 days cumulative in a school year. This is a lag

24:41.640 --> 24:48.920
indicator, so that's important to note, meaning we're only looking at 2018-19 data in this indicator.

24:48.920 --> 24:57.000
The reason I bring this up is because the impact of school site closures and the impact on suspension

24:57.000 --> 25:04.200
expulsion data that we will see next year, and we will also likely see the impact of distance learning

25:05.320 --> 25:09.560
on this indicator as well. There's obviously just not going to be as much suspension expulsion that

25:09.560 --> 25:15.320
we would see in a normal school year, so we will see an impact on this indicator next year, and

25:15.320 --> 25:22.680
we'll probably see an impact in the following year as well. For 2018-19, we did identify an

25:22.680 --> 25:30.920
increase of 1.1% to a total of 2.51% of students with disabilities who are suspended or expelled

25:30.920 --> 25:37.240
greater than 10 days. I also wanted to bring least restrictive environment to you all. This

25:37.240 --> 25:42.520
is placement. This is a very, very important indicator for us because we believe that students

25:42.520 --> 25:50.280
are placed in the right environment. They have a reduction in behavior concerns and also an

25:50.280 --> 25:56.440
increase in access to the general education curriculum. It's a multi-level indicator,

25:56.440 --> 26:00.920
meaning we're looking at a couple of three different areas. We're looking at the number

26:00.920 --> 26:06.600
of students who are in regular class greater than 80% of the day. That's 5A. You're looking at

26:06.600 --> 26:11.320
students who are inside the regular class less than 40% of the day. That would be 5B,

26:11.880 --> 26:16.760
and students who have served in public or private separate schools, residential facilities,

26:16.760 --> 26:25.960
or homebound placement, that is indicator 5C. We did meet the target for each one of these indicators,

26:26.840 --> 26:32.200
and we did go in the right direction. But as you know, and I've talked about this indicator in

26:32.200 --> 26:37.720
previous years for those of you who have heard me talk about this multiple times, we are making

26:37.720 --> 26:42.760
progress in this indicator. We're just not making a lot of progress in this indicator. We would want

26:42.760 --> 26:48.600
to see a greater number. So right now, we're sitting at around 58% of students with disabilities

26:48.600 --> 26:54.040
in California who are inside the regular class greater than 80% of the day. We would want to

26:54.040 --> 26:59.880
see a larger number than that. These are children who would have full inclusion and access to the

26:59.880 --> 27:04.360
general education curriculum, and we would want to see more of that because we believe that translates

27:04.360 --> 27:11.560
into better outcomes for students with disabilities. It should be noted, though,

27:11.560 --> 27:17.160
that California is very large, and so what does that mean? So every percentage that you see here

27:17.160 --> 27:21.560
equates to 7,000 more students having access to the general education curriculum

27:22.840 --> 27:29.240
more than 80% of the day, and so I think we want to sort of work with our partners in LEAs and with

27:29.240 --> 27:34.440
CELPAs to help move this number a little bit further, but it is good news that we have around

27:34.440 --> 27:41.000
10,000 more students who have access in 2019-20 to a general education curriculum in a Least

27:41.000 --> 27:47.080
Restricted Environment. I also want to talk about our preschool Least Restricted Environment. I

27:47.080 --> 27:54.760
don't have as much good news on this one as I do on our other one. So this is again a multi-level

27:54.760 --> 27:59.640
indicator. 6A looks at the percent of students receiving a regular early childhood program,

28:00.920 --> 28:05.960
receiving their services in the regular early childhood program, and 6B is the percent of

28:05.960 --> 28:13.960
students in a separate education, class, school, or facility. What we're seeing this year in 2019,

28:13.960 --> 28:19.800
we are seeing that fewer students have access to their services in a regular early childhood

28:19.800 --> 28:25.880
program than they did in the previous year, a decrease of about 2% and more students were

28:25.880 --> 28:30.200
in separate special education classes, schools, or facilities, and these are again children who

28:30.200 --> 28:36.440
are ages three to five. So we are definitely seeing a trend in the long direction. We would

28:36.440 --> 28:40.920
want to see more students having their services in a regular early childhood program.

28:41.400 --> 28:46.040
And then finally, we're going to talk a little bit about indicator 14, another multi-level

28:46.040 --> 28:51.880
indicator. It looks at 14A is the number of students who are no longer in secondary school,

28:51.880 --> 28:56.760
so they left school the previous year, and they're enrolled in some type of post-secondary

28:56.760 --> 29:04.600
school within one year of leaving high school. 14B looks at students who are competitively employed

29:04.600 --> 29:09.080
and who are in some type of post-secondary school within one year of leaving high school,

29:09.080 --> 29:14.120
and then 14C are students who have IPs who left school the previous year, and they're

29:14.120 --> 29:20.840
enrolled in some kind of higher education, some type of post-secondary school, or a training

29:20.840 --> 29:25.720
program, or their competitively employment, and some other employment. So it's sort of a rolling

29:25.720 --> 29:30.760
indicator looking at those three different things. We are seeing a trend in the long

29:30.840 --> 29:37.880
looking at those three different things. We are happy that we met this indicator, and last year

29:37.880 --> 29:43.800
we came to you all. You will see that we did not meet the indicator for 14B, which is competitive

29:43.800 --> 29:50.280
employment, but we are encouraged the fact that we are now much closer to meeting the target,

29:51.240 --> 29:56.360
or we are meeting the target, and we have increased by about 5% over the previous year for

29:56.360 --> 30:01.960
students who are competitively employed. So we want our meeting indicator for each one of these

30:02.760 --> 30:09.720
sub-indicators. So I want to turn it back over to Heather to sort of talk about the next steps for

30:11.240 --> 30:16.840
this APR and about some of the priority areas, and also take questions from the board members as well.

30:19.080 --> 30:24.440
Great, thank you so much, Shiloh. Obviously in terms of next steps, as stated earlier,

30:24.440 --> 30:30.840
this would go back before the state board for approval and then a submission to OSEP

30:30.840 --> 30:37.240
in early February. In terms of priority areas within the special education division, there's

30:37.240 --> 30:44.200
several, there's many, and so don't want to give you the laundry list today, and we have time to

30:44.200 --> 30:49.640
sort of really discuss priority areas over time, but there are really some priority areas that I

30:49.640 --> 30:57.240
think are worth noting for us here today, and one of those is really ensuring that our components

30:57.960 --> 31:06.200
of what we call the general supervision are fully functioning, healthy, and sort of talking to one

31:06.200 --> 31:11.720
another, and what I mean by that is that the components of general supervision, as really

31:11.720 --> 31:17.240
described by the Office of Special Education Programs, or OSEP, are comprised of the state

31:17.240 --> 31:23.080
performance plan, which includes obviously the annual performance report, policies, procedures,

31:23.080 --> 31:30.280
effective implementation, integrated monitoring, fiscal management, data, improvement on correction

31:30.280 --> 31:35.160
activities and incentives, effective dispute resolution, and targeted TA and professional

31:35.160 --> 31:41.320
development to the field, and so these are things that our division within CDE covers, and so

31:41.320 --> 31:46.920
it's important for us to really focus on ensuring that those components are functioning and

31:46.920 --> 31:55.160
healthy to really support improved progress over time as well, so looking forward to digging into

31:55.160 --> 32:02.600
those specific areas so that we can continue to move the needle forward for students with disabilities.

32:02.600 --> 32:09.720
In terms of another just priority area, obviously, is that the need for continued discussion and

32:09.720 --> 32:16.440
innovation around, you know, whether it's distance or hybrid or even small group learning

32:16.440 --> 32:21.880
during the pandemic continues to remain a focus for us here at CDE to support and assist

32:23.160 --> 32:29.160
our partners in the field to continue to provide the needed and necessary supports and services

32:29.160 --> 32:35.800
for our students so that they continue to thrive during this time. Another focus of our division,

32:35.800 --> 32:40.760
which is really exciting, is really stepping into the early intervention and early childhood

32:40.760 --> 32:47.880
space and really looking at that intersection of our part C to B services so that we do end up

32:49.880 --> 32:56.360
with more students than not ending up in inclusive pre-K and Kinder programs as well.

32:57.240 --> 33:01.640
As you saw on the slide earlier, English learners with disabilities comprise roughly 17%

33:02.600 --> 33:07.480
of our students with disabilities, and for me, that is a huge focus area and an area of opportunity

33:08.120 --> 33:13.160
for, I think, some really innovative work in terms of how we address the unique needs of students

33:13.160 --> 33:19.720
who are also English learners across the state. Teacher recruitment and retention of a truly

33:19.720 --> 33:26.920
diverse workforce is also key and critical to ensure that our students have high quality

33:27.640 --> 33:32.920
teachers and support staffs in front of them each and every day. And as Shiloh noted before, in terms

33:32.920 --> 33:38.200
of just post-secondary transitions, and it's great that we're doing better in that area,

33:38.840 --> 33:45.720
and that really the focus is to ensure that our students, upon leaving our K-12 system,

33:45.720 --> 33:52.360
have multiple pathways for students to realize and maximize their independence and dispel

33:53.320 --> 33:59.560
those limiting beliefs on what can and cannot be done for them as well. Like I said before,

33:59.720 --> 34:07.400
there are honestly many more priorities, but we appreciate the time here for you to discuss today

34:07.400 --> 34:13.720
and just know that the investment and excitement around special education in California is quite

34:13.720 --> 34:19.400
frankly astonishing, and I'm excited that we have positioned ourselves to do groundbreaking

34:19.400 --> 34:23.400
work on our journey ahead. So thank you, and I look forward to the next time that we meet,

34:23.400 --> 34:25.560
and happy to answer any questions for you at this time.

34:29.720 --> 34:37.480
Thank you for that thorough presentation. At this point, we're going to open the phone line

34:37.480 --> 34:42.280
for the public comment queue, and if you could put the public comment slide up, that would be

34:42.280 --> 34:49.640
terrific. Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item can do so by calling the

34:49.640 --> 35:08.680
number that will soon be on the slide. Who has that slide? Yes, I'll put it up real quick. Great,

35:08.680 --> 35:16.440
thank you. Members of the public wishing to provide comment can do so by calling the number

35:16.440 --> 35:21.720
that will soon appear on this slide and entering the access code. While we're waiting for members

35:21.720 --> 35:26.840
of the public to call in, I want to ask Vice President Strauss if she has any initial comments

35:26.840 --> 35:31.960
as liaison. Then I'll ask board members if they want to ask one clarifying question or make a

35:31.960 --> 35:37.320
comment before we go to public comment, which will be followed by board discussion. Board members,

35:37.320 --> 35:41.800
can you please raise your hand in the participant panel of the Zoom at this time if you have a

35:41.800 --> 35:51.240
clarifying question? First of all, Heather, welcome to the state board. Again, I echo

35:51.880 --> 35:55.080
President Darling-Hammond's welcome to California. We're delighted that you've

35:55.800 --> 36:01.240
joined our Department of Education, and we look forward to continuing to work with you and benefit

36:01.240 --> 36:06.600
from your strong experience and leadership in Illinois before you came here. Thank you so much.

36:07.560 --> 36:13.800
Shiloh, thank you for all the work on the data. As a liaison to the Advisory Commission on Special

36:13.800 --> 36:19.960
Ed, I see Shiloh's work consistently, and I just have to say we are so fortunate that you all are

36:19.960 --> 36:26.680
supporting our students of special needs in California. This is an annual temperature check

36:26.680 --> 36:33.160
for us on where we are in California, and I just appreciate the data that show us really the big

36:33.160 --> 36:39.080
picture in California. I appreciate that we're making progress, although slow, and we recognize

36:39.080 --> 36:45.400
that this is lag data, and it doesn't really give us really data on how we're doing during COVID. We

36:45.400 --> 36:49.800
know local districts have their own data and how they're monitoring their students with special

36:49.800 --> 36:55.240
needs, but I do think it really highlights for us some priority areas, which Heather talked about,

36:55.240 --> 37:00.040
and one that I really appreciate is the conversation about disproportionality, because

37:00.040 --> 37:04.920
I think that's actually helped districts who hadn't maybe paid attention to that because

37:04.920 --> 37:11.080
their overall data show different information, and I think this kind of helps kind of push the

37:11.080 --> 37:17.720
conversation about least restrictive environment, looking for first best instruction and tier one

37:17.720 --> 37:23.800
instruction before students are identified for special needs services, and so I think this report

37:23.800 --> 37:29.560
and this process, while data heavy, is actually a good tool for us to guide districts. So just so

37:29.800 --> 37:34.040
in March we're going to be talking about this again, and in March we're going to hear about

37:34.040 --> 37:40.600
technical assistance and what the CDE is doing to help with this data supporting local education

37:40.600 --> 37:48.280
agencies looking at the discrepancies and the areas of need, and so I think it's an area that

37:48.280 --> 37:54.520
we will continue to talk about, and I appreciate again so much the leadership, the voices on the

37:54.520 --> 38:00.520
advisory commission on special ed, and the work that everybody's doing in this really challenging

38:00.520 --> 38:04.280
time to make sure they reach our students with special needs. We know they're having a really

38:04.280 --> 38:11.560
hard time, some of the most challenging in the COVID hybrid learnings and remote learning. So

38:11.560 --> 38:15.720
with that I'll turn it over back to President Darlingham and any board members that have any

38:15.720 --> 38:20.120
comments. Thank you. Well I want to get to the public comment before we get into discussion,

38:21.000 --> 38:27.000
but if there are any clarifying questions we can take those. I'm not seeing any at the moment.

38:28.760 --> 38:34.040
So we will go ahead with public comment and then we'll come back for our board discussion.

38:35.320 --> 38:41.880
We have one caller in the queue for item number 16. Caller,

38:41.880 --> 38:46.440
please state your name and affiliation for your record. Your time starts now.

38:50.120 --> 38:56.680
Caller, are you available?

39:03.400 --> 39:09.080
Okay, they may have called in for the wrong item. Thank you and there are no more callers in the

39:09.080 --> 39:16.360
queue. Thank you. All right, so we'll go ahead if there's any board discussion before we take a

39:16.360 --> 39:25.560
motion on approving this performance report. Is there any further? I see a hand. Member Navo.

39:27.400 --> 39:33.400
Thank you and good morning everyone and Heather welcome and it's great to have you and Shiloh

39:33.400 --> 39:40.760
as well always appreciate the deep dive into the data and I really just want to offer just a

39:40.760 --> 39:46.200
kudos and maybe some food for thought. Really want to thank you for highlighting Shiloh again

39:46.520 --> 39:53.400
the indicator five and although we're meeting the as you noted meeting the indicator requirements

39:53.400 --> 39:59.480
when you look at that on page 19 and you you look at the percentages between 2013 and 2019

40:00.120 --> 40:07.480
although we're meeting it as you stated it's a minor blip on the in a positive movement forward

40:08.200 --> 40:14.440
and so I'm I'm hopeful that as you come to us in the future that we can have a discussion around

40:14.440 --> 40:21.560
this and to the extent possible leverage the other mechanisms in the state to prioritize this

40:21.560 --> 40:28.840
conversation such as supporting inclusive practices project and maybe even our MTSS arm to really

40:30.120 --> 40:37.160
highlight the ideas and support the field with how do we accelerate the opportunities for students

40:37.160 --> 40:42.600
with disabilities to be involved in the general education classroom so I'm thinking there's a

40:42.600 --> 40:51.160
multi-agency all hands on deck approach to this indicator but again just want to thank you and

40:51.160 --> 41:00.520
offer that as just some food for thought. Thank you. Thank you. Member Rucker. Thank you. First I

41:00.520 --> 41:07.480
want to thank this department staff for this very detailed and very important report and Shiloh I

41:07.480 --> 41:14.280
really do want to thank you for the explanation you gave about the work that is done on the very

41:14.280 --> 41:22.520
technical aspects on how significant disproportionality is reported and what how the findings are developed

41:22.520 --> 41:30.760
behind a lot of that work is also the conversation that I think is worth noting for this board there

41:30.760 --> 41:37.640
is a work group of stakeholders from LEAs across the state concerning significant disproportionality

41:37.640 --> 41:43.480
and I have been attending and monitoring the conversations in that work group and Shiloh

41:43.480 --> 41:50.680
could I ask you just to talk a little bit about that particular collection of stakeholders and

41:50.680 --> 41:55.880
the conversations they've had it's relevant to the comment we just heard from my colleague.

41:56.440 --> 42:05.080
Absolutely so in the 2016 regulation there was a requirement that we seek input from stakeholders

42:05.080 --> 42:11.240
on a couple of very key areas and so we pulled together a really diverse stakeholder group to

42:11.240 --> 42:16.920
make those recommendations and they were around minimum end size and minimum cell size and what's

42:16.920 --> 42:24.040
also known as reasonable progress and so I we have folks from LEAs we have folks from our advocacy

42:25.000 --> 42:30.680
groups we have folks from our special education local plan areas we have teachers and parents

42:30.680 --> 42:36.360
and so it's a pretty diverse stakeholder group and they have helped us really set I think

42:36.360 --> 42:41.400
reasonable progress in a way that holds districts both accountable but recognizes progress when

42:41.400 --> 42:48.040
it's being made appropriately and I think they have also had a lot of discussion about setting

42:48.200 --> 42:55.560
targets and setting the benchmark in a way that is ensuring districts aren't sliding back

42:55.560 --> 43:00.600
if they are making any progress. One key area that they have brought up of concern that I

43:00.600 --> 43:06.920
think we'll continue to discuss in the department and how we'll address is the suspension expulsion.

43:07.640 --> 43:12.280
The U.S. Department of Education did make some changes to suspension expulsion in that it

43:12.280 --> 43:17.160
doesn't identify suspension expulsion in comparison to all students who are suspended

43:17.160 --> 43:24.760
or expelled it identifies suspension expulsion comparing students with disabilities to all

43:24.760 --> 43:29.880
students with disabilities and so there is a way districts you know if you identify a lot of

43:29.880 --> 43:34.360
students with disabilities and then you suspend quite a number of them it will always trigger

43:34.360 --> 43:38.600
the calculation. It's one of the weaknesses in the calculation so the stakeholder group

43:38.760 --> 43:45.720
asked us to really model out what it might look like if we change either the reasonable progress

43:45.720 --> 43:51.880
or to change the alternate risk ratio threshold and so we're looking at the department to see

43:51.880 --> 43:56.200
sort of what the impacts that might be in the future. Those are some of the discussions we've

43:56.200 --> 44:01.800
had it's been a really I think helpful conversation for us to have with them to ensure that we're

44:01.800 --> 44:07.720
setting the right threshold and the right reasonable progress standards. Thank you I'm

44:07.720 --> 44:12.360
so glad you explained that that's the reason why I asked that question and I was hoping

44:12.360 --> 44:16.120
you would bring up the issue about the suspension and expulsion

44:16.120 --> 44:22.040
conversation thank you very very much. Just to add one thing too as well

44:22.760 --> 44:27.320
board member Rucker as well there there's a national conversation on the the intersection

44:27.320 --> 44:36.600
of disability and race that largely is led by the National Center for Systemic Improvement

44:36.600 --> 44:41.480
which is a TA center that is funded by OSEP so they are bringing thought leaders across the

44:41.480 --> 44:48.280
country state directors, OSEP staff, LEAs and other scholars across the field to really have

44:48.280 --> 44:53.240
a national conversation on the intersection of race and disability and really sort of digging

44:53.240 --> 44:58.520
in in terms of how do we continue to to discuss and elevate and address some of the issues as

44:58.520 --> 45:03.800
well so wanted to wanted to plug that in terms of just that you know we're part of a national

45:03.800 --> 45:09.720
conversation with that as well. I appreciate knowing that I was not aware that the state had

45:09.720 --> 45:15.000
gotten involved to that degree in that national conversation disproportionality as many of my

45:15.000 --> 45:21.480
colleagues on the board knows this is a subject and a topic an issue that I have been monitoring

45:21.480 --> 45:26.360
ever since I've been on the board the over representation and the over referral of African

45:26.360 --> 45:32.120
American students of great concerns it's not enough just to lump this con this issue in this

45:32.120 --> 45:38.920
practice into the broad category of disparity it is um what this particular report and the work

45:38.920 --> 45:45.640
group that Shiloh described to you has done this is an example of conversations of real work

45:45.640 --> 45:51.800
and real initiatives that have been undertaken to try to address and resolve it the participants

45:51.800 --> 45:57.160
from the LEAs that are involved in those conversations hold themselves personally

45:57.160 --> 46:05.160
accountable for looking for ways to improve and show gains or a correction attempts at corrections

46:05.160 --> 46:10.440
on those issues so this is a very important conversation a very important model for ways

46:10.440 --> 46:16.360
to address the issues of disparities that we have a broader conversation about so Heather I also want

46:16.360 --> 46:23.160
to add my thanks and my welcome to you for coming to California I'm very excited to see your expertise

46:23.160 --> 46:27.560
join our department and I'm very excited to see the work that you'll be able to help

46:27.560 --> 46:28.760
help this board to lead

46:32.040 --> 46:38.760
I don't see other hands up but I'd like to piggyback on the comments that both member

46:38.760 --> 46:46.440
Rucker and member Navo made you know we first of all we welcome you Heather we're thrilled that

46:46.440 --> 46:54.280
you're here and bringing together sort of the framework around what's happening in the state

46:54.280 --> 47:00.040
there's a lot of activity in the state to invest in special education to upgrade professional

47:00.040 --> 47:06.520
development opportunities that are beginning member Navo mentioned the initiatives around MTSS

47:07.400 --> 47:13.400
that have also been underway it would be great if we can begin to link some of the data progress

47:14.040 --> 47:21.240
to the actual you know activities that are underway and start to be able to track a little bit

47:21.800 --> 47:26.840
where we are making progress and how those things may be contributing to them

47:28.760 --> 47:33.880
Skylar I really appreciate it Shiloh I really appreciated the way that you talked about the data

47:34.440 --> 47:41.240
and about the fact that the way the federal government asks us to report it is not always

47:41.240 --> 47:46.360
giving us a full picture on what's going on and I would love to invite you to bring the full picture

47:46.360 --> 47:52.040
to us along with what you have to send to the federal government on things like disproportionate

47:52.040 --> 47:58.040
suspension and expulsion because we need to be you know similarly aware of those kinds of outcomes

47:58.680 --> 48:03.240
as they exist in the entire population of students not just you know within

48:03.240 --> 48:10.440
disproportionately within special education students are also disproportionately

48:11.080 --> 48:17.880
a subject suspension and expulsion and we want again to be able to track those things in relation

48:17.880 --> 48:25.160
to the interventions and strategies that we're putting in place to hopefully begin to see some

48:25.160 --> 48:32.920
differences one of the points that member Navo made was that that we can use a multi-agency approach

48:33.400 --> 48:40.280
I think that's so very important and you know much to be encouraged and one of the agencies

48:41.400 --> 48:48.680
among many is the California teacher credentialing commission which is trying to evolve an approach

48:48.680 --> 48:55.640
to credentialing that could support least restrictive environment placements in a much

48:55.640 --> 49:04.120
stronger way we had a change of policy back over more than a decade ago that

49:05.560 --> 49:09.640
changed credentialing for special education teachers for education specialists as they're

49:09.640 --> 49:14.440
called in California such that you can become an education specialist without having been a

49:14.440 --> 49:20.840
general education teacher first without having that core credential and then if you did come

49:20.840 --> 49:26.040
in through that pathway you were actually not credentialed to teach regular general education

49:26.040 --> 49:34.440
students which meant that placements it actually led to more segregation of of treatment and and

49:34.440 --> 49:40.920
placements for special education students so we need to be moving these policies you know in sync

49:40.920 --> 49:47.400
with each other if we're going to get to the goals that we all care about both around credentialing

49:47.400 --> 49:54.440
room professional learning around the ways in which we structure systems and mtss so we're just

49:54.440 --> 50:02.760
thrilled to get a window into the work that you're launching we want more we want to continue to to

50:02.760 --> 50:10.360
learn you know what strategies are that may be working may be problematic and so we can really

50:11.320 --> 50:16.440
contribute to the state of moving in the right direction right we want to move the needle with

50:16.440 --> 50:27.080
you thank you both very much we can take a motion to approve the report so i will move approval of

50:27.080 --> 50:36.760
the annual performance report prepared by the cde second second that thank you very much

50:38.600 --> 50:43.080
and at this point we'll need to i think do is there any further discussion

50:43.960 --> 50:50.680
we'll do a roll call vote member burr aye present darlin hamid

50:51.800 --> 51:04.200
aye member fatah aye member glover woods yes member mcquillan yes member navo

51:05.080 --> 51:16.520
aye member patil brownson yes member rodriguez yes member rucker yes vice president strouse

51:17.320 --> 51:25.400
yes member son yes and thank you for this very thorough report motion carries unanimously

51:26.360 --> 51:33.560
thank you thank you very much agenda item 17 has been withdrawn so we're going to move on

51:33.560 --> 51:40.360
to agenda item 18 and then we'll take a break after this item item 18 is the consideration of

51:40.360 --> 51:46.760
a retroactive request for determination of funding with reasonable basis mitigating circumstances as

51:46.760 --> 51:53.560
required for non-classroom based charter schools and the cde recommends that the state board approve

51:53.560 --> 51:59.880
the mitigating surface circumstances request and determination of funding requests at the percentage

52:00.040 --> 52:06.520
for the time period as specified for the wab de bois public charter and attachment one and this

52:06.520 --> 52:10.360
item will be presented by stephanie farland from the cde

52:12.680 --> 52:20.840
good morning president darlin hammond and board members i am presenting the next two items along

52:20.840 --> 52:26.680
with my colleague mckenna huey who is the manager in the charter division responsible for funding

52:26.680 --> 52:31.080
determination reviews so we'll be going we'll both be presenting

52:35.880 --> 52:42.840
so item 18 consists of a retroactive request for determination of funding with mitigating

52:42.840 --> 52:50.040
circumstances for w e b de bois charter school public charter school the term retroactive is

52:50.040 --> 52:56.200
used to refer to determination of funding requests submitted after the february 1 renewal deadline

52:56.200 --> 53:01.720
which is prescribed by regulations because it submitted its request after the regulatory deadline

53:01.720 --> 53:07.480
w e b de bois obtained a waiver from the state board at his july meeting thus permitting it to

53:07.480 --> 53:13.480
submit a funding determination request to the cde it might sound familiar because this item

53:13.480 --> 53:19.800
was previously heard at the october accs meeting and november state board meeting at

53:20.600 --> 53:27.160
um the nove at the november meeting the state board chose not to act on this item and requested

53:27.160 --> 53:33.080
that the cde obtain further clarification of the school's request for mitigating circumstances and

53:33.080 --> 53:38.280
bring this item back to the state board at his january meeting after the november meeting and

53:38.280 --> 53:43.400
at the cde's request the charter school provided additional information regarding their mitigating

53:43.400 --> 53:48.440
circumstances request which will be discussed in further detail later in this presentation

53:48.440 --> 53:55.960
and which the cde presented to the accs at its december meeting after considering all information

53:55.960 --> 54:01.720
the accs moved to approve the cde's recommendation to approve the charter school's request for

54:01.720 --> 54:06.440
mitigating circumstances and the funding determination at 100 percent for two years

54:07.320 --> 54:10.120
to the sbe by a vote of six to one

54:10.520 --> 54:17.720
just as a refresher background on the determination of funding process and web's request in order to

54:17.720 --> 54:23.480
qualify for a recommendation to receive 100 funding for its non-classroom based ada a charter must

54:23.480 --> 54:29.000
meet the following criteria spend at least 40 percent of its public revenues on instructional

54:29.000 --> 54:34.840
certified certificated salaries and benefits spend at least 80 percent of its total revenues on

54:34.920 --> 54:40.680
salaries and benefits spend at least 80 percent of its total revenues on instruction and instruction

54:40.680 --> 54:48.360
related services and maintain a pupil teacher ratio that does not exceed 25 to one the cde

54:48.360 --> 54:55.000
reviewed web's request and found that it does not meet the criteria for 100 funding as it did not

54:55.000 --> 55:00.760
spend at least 80 percent of its total revenues on instruction and instruction related services

55:00.760 --> 55:05.000
without the consideration of mitigating circumstances the school qualifies for a

55:05.000 --> 55:12.200
funding determination of 85 percent however we do have this mitigating circumstance request

55:13.240 --> 55:17.240
detailed information regarding the school's revenues and expenditures can be found in its

55:17.240 --> 55:23.320
funding determination form which is linked in the agenda item for charter schools that do not meet

55:23.320 --> 55:29.720
the criteria for a recommendation of 100 funding regulations permit the accs and the state board

55:29.720 --> 55:36.440
to consider a reasonable basis or mitigating circumstances by which to make a recommendation

55:36.440 --> 55:41.160
other than the one that results from the expenditure criteria specified mitigating

55:41.160 --> 55:46.600
circumstances may include documented data regarding individual circumstances of the charter school

55:46.600 --> 55:52.520
and or one-time expenses or unique or exceptional exceptional expenses without a reason of

55:52.520 --> 55:58.040
mitigating circumstances a charter school funding rate may be reduced from 100 percent to 85 or 70

55:58.040 --> 56:04.520
percent or may be denied at zero percent web debois submitted a request for mitigating

56:04.520 --> 56:09.080
circumstances citing the need to expend a considerable amount of revenues on facilities

56:09.960 --> 56:15.160
as well as a decrease in its non-classroom based ada caused by a campus closure resulting from

56:15.160 --> 56:21.080
the anderson shasta court decision additional details regarding the request can be found in the

56:21.080 --> 56:32.520
item all right good morning state board members um my name is mckenna hilly from the charter

56:32.520 --> 56:39.080
schools division and i will be presenting the next couple of slides um so as stephanie has

56:39.080 --> 56:45.560
previously mentioned at its november meeting the state board chose not to act on this item

56:45.560 --> 56:51.000
and requested that the cde obtain clarification of the school's mitigating circumstances

56:51.560 --> 56:56.200
specifically the state board requested clarification of the relationship between agape

56:56.200 --> 57:01.400
schools and the ellis family partnership as well as information of the school's facility lease

57:01.400 --> 57:07.800
agreements so cde staff did request clarifying information of the school and presented it to

57:07.800 --> 57:14.040
the eccs at its december meeting the specific information provided by the school is detailed

57:14.040 --> 57:18.280
in the item as well as in the eccs attachments which are also linked in the item

57:22.360 --> 57:27.080
so regarding the relationship between agape schools and the ellis family partnership

57:27.080 --> 57:33.480
per the information provided by wb debois agape schools entered into an operating agreement with

57:33.480 --> 57:39.560
ellis family partnership in november 2004 for the purposes of developing a permanent charter

57:39.560 --> 57:44.440
school facility and holding the titles of the properties that agape schools occupy

57:45.240 --> 57:52.280
so this partnership formed agape lslc which maintains two general managers so one manager

57:52.280 --> 57:56.760
represents agape schools and the other manager represents the ellis family partnership

57:57.560 --> 58:04.120
neither manager is compensated nor a member of their own board and then regarding the facility

58:04.120 --> 58:11.880
lease agreements wb debois currently leases two facilities from agape lslc one is located on p

58:11.880 --> 58:17.240
street in fresno california and the other is located on martin luther king boulevard also in

58:17.240 --> 58:24.040
fresno so wb debois previously served students at the p street facility which is located within

58:24.040 --> 58:29.080
the boundaries of the fresno unified school district however it has since transitioned to

58:29.160 --> 58:34.120
serving students entirely at the martin luther king boulevard facility and that transition

58:34.120 --> 58:41.000
happened in the 2018-19 fiscal year so the martin luther king boulevard facility is located within

58:41.000 --> 58:46.440
its authorizing district's boundaries and their authorizing district is washington unified school

58:46.440 --> 58:54.840
district so although wb debois no longer serves students at the p street facility it does continue

58:54.840 --> 59:02.440
to use that facility for central and back office services the school's use of the p street facility

59:02.440 --> 59:07.480
has gradually decreased along with its rent obligation since it transitioned primarily

59:07.480 --> 59:12.680
to the martin luther king boulevard facility so additional details regarding each of these

59:12.680 --> 59:18.360
matters is available in the item and in the accs item attachments as well

59:18.360 --> 59:31.480
so the cde has determined that the information submitted by web debois public charter school

59:31.480 --> 59:37.320
supports its claim for mitigating circumstances and its request for 100 funding determination

59:37.320 --> 59:42.040
therefore the cde recommends that the state board approve the school's request for mitigating

59:42.040 --> 59:47.640
circumstances and approve its determination of funding request for 100 funding for a time period

59:47.640 --> 59:54.280
of two years as specified in attachment one and i believe i haven't looked at all the squares but

59:54.280 --> 59:59.240
i i believe the school is is online and available to answer questions if if needed

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.160
um yeah

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:10.520
okay

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:21.720
okay anything else that you wanted to and no i'm done with that item okay sorry sorry for the

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:32.760
abrupt ending okay uh so we do have the um public comment slide uh up there um and so uh we'll open

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:38.600
the phone line for public comment uh members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:44.520
may do so by calling the number on this slide and entering the access code and while we're waiting

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:49.240
for members of the public to call in i want to first ask members burr and son if they have any

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:54.440
initial comments as liaisons and then i'll ask uh board members if they have any clarifications

01:00:54.440 --> 01:01:00.520
before we turn to public comment thank you president garden hammond i'd like to make a

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:07.400
brief statement if that's okay um given the conversations that occurred at the acps meeting

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:13.400
and some that we've had at the state board i wanted to preface this next this item the next

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:19.080
item with a brief statement the california department of education is charged with the

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:28.920
following education code sections 47 612.5 and 47 634.2 and relevant sections of the california

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:33.960
code of regulations when reviewing funding determination requests and making recommendations

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:39.320
for apportionment funding for classroom-based charter schools over the past year funding

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:46.680
determinations have come under increased scrutiny at the accs and spe meetings with requests for

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:54.120
staff work investigations documentation access and funding withholding that exceed the intended

01:01:54.120 --> 01:02:01.080
scope and purpose of the statute and regulations in some instances pending audit work and

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:05.640
investigation has been cited as reason to deny funding for the existing schools

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:12.360
as a reminder non-classroom-based charter schools may only receive apportionment funding for

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:17.400
classroom-based non-classroom-based instruction if a determination of funding is made by the

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:22.680
state board of education it's worth mentioning that these are the only type of schools in our

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:28.920
entire public school system that is required to go through an additional scrutiny in order to

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:36.200
receive funding for from the state despite the fact that a large number of these schools provide

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:42.920
a significant level of site-based and classroom-based instructional modes so it's important for us to

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:48.440
understand that these requests to deny or delay funding have considerable consequences for schools

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:55.080
students and teachers until such time that legislative changes are made the department

01:02:55.080 --> 01:03:01.800
must continue to follow the process specified in law the department is granted the authority to

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:07.560
bring back funding determination concerns to the state board of education if new information comes

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:13.320
to light through audit or investigation in the case of all of the charter schools being considered

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:20.440
today and at prior meetings this is the appropriate course of action if concerns arise that may be

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:25.880
have bearing on the school's funding determination level so i really want to just commend the

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:31.400
department and their due diligence in securing the information that the state board members have

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:36.280
requested and know that the department is working appropriately within the process that they are

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:42.360
tasked to follow in statute having gone through this process in the past i know personally that

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:47.640
student staff is thorough and diligent in their work in following the current law and regulations

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:55.080
you'll see that in the recommendations for this item next item the funding determinations are

01:03:55.080 --> 01:04:01.880
for a limited time so it does provide us and that they cover the current school year as well

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:09.400
so the limited time does give the department and the state board additional time to or

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:17.480
a opening to be able to review in a very short time any of the schools that are up in this item

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:25.080
the next item thanks thank you member Burke do you have any framing comments no i just appreciate

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:31.640
member Sun reminding us of what the statutory requirements are here with respect to non-classroom

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:39.000
based schools and also thanks Stephanie and McKenna for all of their due diligence as as Ting

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:45.080
mentioned i believe they went above and beyond and they really dug into this at the request of the

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:51.560
board from our november discussion i just would remind folks too that the accs has heard this

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:57.560
school now twice and both times has made a recommendation for full funding thank you

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:06.360
okay um i'm told that the phone bridge is experiencing some challenges so i want to

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:11.880
encourage uh callers to call back in if they were having any difficulty getting through

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:19.080
um apparently the phone bridge is being repaired so people seem to be able to get in the second

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:23.880
time they call so please keep trying and i think we do have some callers lined up so i'm going to

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:32.120
turn to the phone queue yes currently we have two people in the queue um caller this is for item

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:37.640
number 18 please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:43.080
my name is Lorraine Richards and i am a classroom teacher representing california teachers

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:49.240
association cta continues to have major concerns with the regulations that govern non-classroom

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:54.600
based charter funding determinations we're also extremely troubled with what appears to be a lack

01:05:54.600 --> 01:06:01.480
of oversight from the authorizers of ncbs and the disconnect between funding determinations

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:06.280
and the reality of rampant issues throughout this industry there's a significant difference

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:12.200
there's a significant amount of co-mingling of interest and it appears that the state funds

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:18.280
generated by web dubois public charter are being used to benefit agape's other enterprises and agape

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:25.560
alice's llc with each of these entities being managed by the same person cta poses the cd's

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:32.280
recommendation of granting mitigating circumstances for 100 funding for two years because the reasons

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:38.520
they deem as mitigating circumstances were under their control due to their role as a manager of

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:47.080
the leap holder thank you thank you caller next caller please state your name and affiliation

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:54.760

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:33.960
um so we'll turn to board discussion are there other board members who would like to

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.000
comment or ask a question

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:49.320
uh member navo yeah i appreciate very much uh stephanie your hard work and the clarity around

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:55.160
this i'm i agree with board member board member son and burr that there's been much effort behind

01:07:55.160 --> 01:08:01.080
the scenes trying to rectify this but i also realize that this issue comes up has come up

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:05.640
several times now and the regs have been in question and is there any conversations about

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:15.640
how we're going to address those um did you want were you asking me member navo

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:19.720
you or anyone if i be able to answer that

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:28.280
uh i'm not aware of any yeah no we i mean we we have had conversations obviously i know

01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:38.120
member um son has has uh requested that we gather folks and stakeholders to discuss this issue um

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:46.680
further and and look look at the um regulations and and possibly look at um new legislation so

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:53.240
those conversations is have happened and are happening um but at the moment i don't have a

01:08:54.280 --> 01:09:00.520
sort of a timeline of of when when we'll start that work but but we certainly there's there's

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.960
a desire to do that from all sides

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:11.000
and i see that judy size has a comment or perhaps an answer

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:18.840
no pressure this is judy size i would say that um there are lots of conversations going on in the

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:24.040
legislature right now about this issue you may recall that as part of um ab 1505 there was a

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:29.320
two-year moratorium on the establishment of new non-classroom based charter schools

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:34.040
so we understand that there's going to be some legislation this year possibly around

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:39.480
non-classroom based in the funding determination process so of course any new legislation would

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:46.520
inform our rule making process so um we are hopeful that we'll see some legislation and

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:52.840
then that can lead to us reviewing the regulations but until the underlying statutory issues are

01:09:52.840 --> 01:10:00.600
dealt with um i think we're sort of at the place that we are for now thank you member

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:06.280
glover woods oh let me go back um member navo did you get all of your questions answered

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:46.280
okay so um our final item is item 19 the consideration of requests for determination

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:51.560
of funding as required for non-classroom based charter schools pursuant to california

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:59.800
education code sections 476.1.5 and 476.3.4.2 and the associated california code of regulations

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:05.400
title five the cde recommends that we approve the determination of funding requests at the

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:11.640
percentages and for the time periods as specified for the charter schools in attachment one

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:21.800
and the cde notes that at the december 9th 2020 accs meeting the cde had proposed a recommendation

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:28.920
for 85 funding for insight at san diego and insight at san joaquin based on the information

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:34.520
provided by both schools at that time but following the accs meeting the cde received

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:39.080
additional information from the schools and their auditor that addressed the outstanding

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:45.960
questions held by the cde as such the cde has changed this recommendation for these two schools

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:52.600
to 100 funding for the time periods as specified in attachment one and this item will be presented

01:13:52.600 --> 01:14:03.480
by stephanie farland from the cde stephanie please begin thank you um so item 19 consists

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:09.800
regular requests for determination of funding by six renewing non-classroom based charter schools

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:17.000
which are listed on the slide and in the item and just for clarification

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:26.520
oh it actually we added that as a note so that insight schools are part of the cava organization

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:36.200
so just wanted to clarify that next slide as previously mentioned in order to see receive 100

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:41.320
funding for their non-classroom based ada charter schools must submit a request for determination

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:47.000
of funding to the cde and meet the following criteria spend at least 40 of its public revenues

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.200
on instructional certificated salaries and benefits and spend at least 80 of its total

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:58.280
revenues on instruction and instruction related services and maintain a pupil teacher ratio that

01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:05.400
does not exceed 25 to one it is the current it is the cde's current practice upon its receipt of

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:10.360
complete funding determination forms to verify the information submitted on the forms with the

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:15.720
school's annual audits based upon its review of all information provided by the schools as part

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:21.560
of their funding determination request the cde determined has determined that all schools

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:27.160
presented in this item qualify for a 100 funding for their ncb instruction non-classroom based

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:32.360
instruction all schools spending percentages and pupil teacher ratio information can be found in

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:37.640
attachment one detailed information regarding each school's revenues and expenditures can be

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:43.720
found in their funding determination forms which are now provided as accs item attachments

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:47.960
I'm going to hand it over to McKenna for the next couple of slides

01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:01.880
all right hello again board members so as Stephanie stated I will be

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:10.200
presenting on the next couple of slides this one here so the cde was previously notified of unresolved

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:16.520
audit findings related to kava and insights calculation of pupil teacher ratios

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:25.400
from the California state controller's office october 2017 audit report and because pupil

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:30.760
to teacher ratio information is one of the three criteria considered for a 100 determination of

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:36.280
funding recommendation the cde did request that additional information be submitted along with

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:43.240
kava and insights renewal funding determination requests specifically the cde requested that

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:49.000
kava and insights submit information regarding their calculation of pupil to teacher ratios

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:55.880
in order to ensure that these ratios were calculated and reported accurately in the

01:16:55.880 --> 01:17:02.360
funding determination forms so the schools did provide this information to the cde and a detailed

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:07.960
summary of the cde's communications with these schools as well as the specific information

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:11.800
requested and provided are available in the item

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:25.720
okay and as President Darling-Hammond stated before the cde does note that at the time of the

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:32.040
December accs meeting the cde was proposing to recommend that the state board approve the funding

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:38.200
determinations for inside at san diego and inside at san joaquin which to clarify are both a part

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:45.960
of the kava network at 85 so when reviewing the funding determination forms for these schools

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:52.520
the cde found that the expenditures reported to be inconsistent with the expenditures indicated in

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:59.880
the school's 2018-19 annual audits so specifically it appeared that some of the school's administrative

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:08.200
expenses were reported as instruction and related services expenses so using the numbers provided

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:14.040
in both schools audits the cde found that inside at san diego and inside at san joaquin did not

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:20.040
meet the 80 spending threshold on instruction and instruction related services and therefore

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:25.240
qualified for only a recommendation of 85 funding for their non-classroom based ada

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:33.240
okay so the cde did request clarification from the auditor of the two inside schools

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:38.120
of these discrepancies found within the funding determination form and the school's audits

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:45.640
this clarification was provided by the auditor after the December accs meeting so the auditor

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:51.160
explained that some of the instruction and related services expenses were classified as

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:56.520
administrative support services in the audit due to differences in terminology between the

01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:03.160
generally accepted accounting principles and the funding determination form so in the auditor's

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:09.160
clarification they did certify that all expenses indicated in the funding determination forms

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:15.480
were expensed and reported accurately and in accordance with regulations so the cde found

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:20.440
this explanation which was provided by the auditor to be sufficient and

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:24.840
has thus revised its recommendation for these schools to be 100 percent

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:28.120
for their non-classroom based instruction

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:42.840
so i'm going to hand it back over to Stephanie and Stephanie it looks like you're muted

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:52.200
thank you so at the accs December accs meeting the accs voted on three separate motions so they

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:57.800
took the one item and they divided it up into three separate motions they moved to approve the

01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:04.120
cde's recommendation to the sb that the funding determinations for the three kava schools be

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:09.800
approved at 100 for two years that motion was passed on a vote of six to one so those are the

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:18.120
vote of six to one so those are the three that we originally recommended 100 funding they moved

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:23.640
the second motion was they moved to approve the cde's recommended recommendation to the sb that

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:30.360
the funding determinations for the two kava insight schools be approved at 85 for two years

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:35.800
with the caveat that should the kava insight schools provide additional information to support

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:41.560
a 100 recommendation the cde may change their recommendation so that both schools receive full

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:48.680
funding which is what we did so that was called that was the accs's recommendation on those two

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:55.000
schools and then they made a third motion to approve cde's recommendation to the sb

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:01.880
that the funding determination for caprio point academy be approved at 100 for two years however

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:08.520
no formal recommendation was moved to the sb on this particular school's motion because of a lack

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:16.120
of a quorum the motion did not pass by a vote or the the motion was made and there were four yes

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:25.320
votes one no vote and two abstentions and i will mention that and and i'm sure teen was on the call

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:32.280
at the time and she could she could member sun could certainly chime in the conversation around

01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:40.440
cabrio point and why we had two abstentions was really around the fact that cabrio point academy

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:48.360
is part of a ficmat audit at the moment they are currently working with that or auditing that school

01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:54.840
as part of the inspire audit that ficmat is conducting and i think there was some concern

01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:03.160
we understand that there's an audit happening we do not have any reports or results i don't

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:10.520
believe that audit is finished yet and so i want to remind the board that if anything comes of that

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:17.720
audit that would impact the funding determination for this school we do have a regulatory the

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:24.280
regulatory ability to bring this school back and re-review their funding determination

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:34.360
but as there's no we have no audit exceptions now we have no reports of wrongdoing and this school

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:42.920
is not under revocation at their own district so we did fill based on the regulations that we need

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:48.680
to follow in order to approve these funding determination requests that cabrio point does

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:56.120
meet the requirements for 100 funding and as noted all of these schools we are renewing for two years

01:22:56.120 --> 01:23:02.520
which gives us the ability to come back and look at them as well within two years

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:10.600
so we are requesting in conclusion we're we're all requesting that based on all the information

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:14.840
that we have gathered and reviewed the cde recommends that all schools presented in this

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:24.600
item be approved for 100 funding for two fiscal years okay thank you let's put up the

teachers association cta believes that it is it is inappropriate for the state board to approve

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:24.200
100 funding determination of even two years when there is such a significant amount of alleged

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:31.560
fraud and improprietary surrounding cabrio point academy and the inspire schools cabrio point is

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:38.360
set to receive 42 million per year as highlighted in the letter from california virtual educators

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:45.080
in the letter from california virtual educators united kava and insight schools have a history

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:53.160
of prior prioritizing the revenue generated for k-12 inc over the needs of their educators

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:58.840
and students cta believes that there must be more oversight and transparency with these ncbs

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:04.920
and to remind everyone that the a3 administrators had very similar business practices signed the

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:10.360

board discussion are there any comments or questions for members of the board

01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:34.360
i am oh member rucker thank you i just wanted to be get a clarification from stephanie i want to

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:42.280
make sure i heard this correctly because of the ongoing audit activities i want to make sure i

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:51.400
understood you to say that if there are findings that have an impact on the decision the board

01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:58.280
would make today that there are regulatory remedies available to the department and the

01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:05.000
board to make corrections on the funding determination is that correct yes member

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.680
rucker that is correct we do have and the board has regulatory

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:16.680
allowances to bring back any non any charter school the non-funding determination

01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:19.960
to re-review their funding determination and make any corrections

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:25.960
okay and i understand that there's a there are timeline issues involved with the funding

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:34.840
determination process and this the this particular charter is on the agenda today because um they've

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:40.680
asked you they followed the due diligence and responded to the staff as you were preparing

01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:48.520
decided but is there a reason why the board cannot wait to make this uh

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:53.880
funding determined nation decision until after the audit work is completed

01:29:55.480 --> 01:30:01.800
there there are funding determinations and and the board and and mckenna please jump in if if i'm

01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:08.840
not uh saying this correctly um but there are funding uh there are deadlines and the deadlines

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:15.960
do impact funding depending on when these happen versus uh the the board's approval before p1 and

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:25.080
p2 and i do believe that uh we do need to make these decisions um this month for these schools

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:31.720
to not impact their funding um and i'm not sure when figmat will be finished with their audit

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:38.600
um i know this is not the only school that is part of the uh complete audit i know there are

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:45.080
several schools and so i don't have a timeline for when that audit might be finished okay so you're

01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:51.080
so part of this is we have these deadlines because the p1 and p2 and to make sure that

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:58.360
there's a continuing revenue stream but also it's not really clear when thick map would actually

01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:08.280
complete their process for for this to come back um in a timely way right and and you know this is

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:14.920
this is uh this particular item that we're approving them for two years i would think

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:22.840
that the audit would be finished within um that time um so we we certainly i i firmly believe we

01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:27.800
will have time to bring this school back if anything comes up in the audit that would impact

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:32.680
what our decision is here today and you read my mind i was going to ask you do you believe

01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:37.480
the audit would be completed within the period of time that you're recommending since the two

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:42.840
years is less is is a shorter time frame than these would normally be approved for you do believe

01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:49.640
figmat should complete the audit within the two years i mean i can't predict for sure because i

01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:55.720
don't work for figmat but the audit has been going on for a little bit of time so certainly

01:31:55.800 --> 01:32:02.120
it will um and and just to remind the board and and i didn't mention this in the in the presentation

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:11.000
but normally these uh renewal items we normally approve them for three to four years and because

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:17.320
we know there are so many concerns um we did limit this particular school to a two-year renewal so

01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:22.040
even if um the audit isn't finished we're bringing this school back

01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:29.320
much sooner than we do other renewals i see that you besides is waiting to make a comment so let

01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:36.040
me turn to judy real quick um yes i just i just want to add that i think maybe stephanie mentioned

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:40.840
it two years is the minimum amount of time that we can give a renewals a renewing school so we

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:46.360
are giving them the minimum amount of time and as stephanie has already stated they will have to

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:51.960
come back much sooner than other renewing schools would given that there is the figmat audit going

01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:56.920
on yeah we've been talking with mike fine and it's just not completed yet so there are just

01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:02.280
no conclusions we can draw at this time i understand it i thank you very much for giving

01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:08.440
it for adding that information judy my concern is i have major concerns about this particular

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:14.920
lea and with the motion as it's proposed all of these would be lumped into one motion i

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:22.120
um and i would vote no just because i have this concern about this one lea is it possible

01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:29.000
to divide the motion so that the board can consider these recommendations separately

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:38.520
that's what i'm asking um as a process question judy um yes we can are you thinking member record

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:44.360
that we would do the insight schools as one motion and then cabrio point i mean kava schools all the

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:51.000
kava schools which are kava in insight and as one and then the cabrio point inspire one is

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:55.000
the separate is that what you were thinking it would make it easier for me not to vote no on

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:01.320
all of them yes that's what the accs did um i think stephanie mckenna can you go back to the

01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:10.760
one slide that lists all of the schools and um there you go so we could do um california

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:17.240
virtual academy at king's inside at san diego inside at san joaquin california virtual academy

01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:22.120
sonoma and california virtual academy sutter is one motion and then we could do caprio point

01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:28.120
as a second motion is that right member record okay yes yes that's what that's my request

01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:35.640
and i think that uh you are the there are no further hands raised for comment at this time

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:43.000
i can so seeing none you could oh member son yeah i was going to say that i

01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:51.480
would be happy to make um two separate motions i will say that i not change the recommendation

01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:58.840
or my my support of the city recommendation for point uh because it is one of the two years

01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:04.520
is this year in which they are operating in service students and we know that the end of

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:11.800
the year will come just like that and then um and they would have had to reapply again in

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:18.280
february for the next year if you um so i don't know i just thought it would be um

01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:25.800
difficult for us uh for to make any additional changes to us given that they have already the

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:34.280
minimum recommendation so uh i understand if you don't feel that as i said they um i understand

01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:40.280
if you don't feel that dividing the motion uh simply so that i could vote no against caprio

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:46.040
point which would matter that much you don't have to divide the motion and i'll just vote no

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:50.280
i'm just asking if that's possible if you don't want to divide the motion

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:53.160
for the reasons that you just stated i perfectly understand that

01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:02.360
well i was going to call for a motion so um and i think judy wants to make another

01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:07.320
comment before we do that yeah i just remember rucker i you weren't recommending any changes

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:10.440
to the percentages or the years is that correct just to make sure i understand

01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:18.280
you just wanted to have two separate votes correct okay so either of you could make a motion and it

01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:28.120
could be one motion or two judy do you want to raise your hand again no yes all right so

01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:33.240
what i will do is i will go ahead and make the motion that we approve cde's recommendation

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:39.720
for the california virtual academy uh schools and the insight schools

01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:47.080
all right there's a motion on the table do i have a second for that motion i second the motion

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:54.760
all right uh any further discussion of that motion all in favor oh we need to do a roll call vote

01:36:54.760 --> 01:37:03.480
brooks may can you do that member burr aye president darling hammond aye member fatah

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:12.120

yes member rucker yes vice president strouse yes member son yes the motion carries

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:45.080
thank you uh and now i think we need another motion do i have a an additional motion

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:49.320
regarding cabrillo point

01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:54.280
i will make the motion to approve cd's recommendation for cabrillo point and i

01:37:54.280 --> 01:38:00.360
wanted to also point out that we are still operate in the premise in this democracy that

01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:06.360
we are innocent until proven guilty so while there may be speculation that we do not have

01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:13.000
the results yet and i do not get comfortable making a determination of this particular

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:20.360
um determination of this after the audit is completed so you've made the motion do i have

01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:28.280
a second for that motion i'd like to second the motion and also say that we've just experienced

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:35.400
in our country what happens when allegations are made that are unproven and so i hope that we will

01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:40.520
abide by the principle of making sure that allegations are actually proven before we

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:46.760
punish the school so we have a motion we have a second is there any further discussion of the

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:54.040
motion so i just want to say that um this has nothing to do with the allegations but with our

01:38:54.040 --> 01:39:01.400
process and the timeline and my concerns about what it is that's being done uh in the process

01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:10.920
of this audit so while i'm sure that neither one of my colleagues want to impugn my reputation

01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:21.160
or my intent by raising the objections to this particular hundred percent funding determination

01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:26.360
i would have otherwise supported the funding determination if it had remained somewhere south

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:34.120
of 100 percent until the audit was completed so i won't be i won't raise ire or concern

01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:41.400
at the suggestion that i have nefarious intent with on not supporting this motion we can talk

01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:49.720
about that later in a non-public forum if you want to all right any other further discussion of the

01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:59.000
