WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.060
I will now call the March 2020 meeting of the State Board of Education to order.

00:13.060 --> 00:15.140
We will commence by saluting the flag.

00:15.140 --> 00:39.220
Vice President Strouss, will you lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.

00:39.220 --> 00:42.220
Thank you.

00:42.220 --> 00:44.940
There is one change in the agenda.

00:44.940 --> 00:52.380
We intend to reopen SBE priorities item again tomorrow morning, just after the closed session.

00:52.380 --> 00:57.240
There are two public hearings on our January agenda, items 14 and 15, which will be heard

00:57.240 --> 00:59.200
tomorrow.

00:59.200 --> 01:04.300
There is a handout on the table in the lobby identifying the proposed items on the consent

01:04.300 --> 01:05.660
calendars.

01:05.660 --> 01:11.540
The proposed regular consent items are items 10 through 13, and the proposed consent waiver

01:11.540 --> 01:16.180
items are waiver 01 through 12.

01:16.180 --> 01:19.820
I'd like to remind board members that any members wishing to remove any items from the

01:19.820 --> 01:26.500
proposed consent calendars should advise Executive Director Karen Staff Walters by 11 o'clock

01:26.500 --> 01:27.500
today.

01:27.500 --> 01:32.460
We'll take up the waiver consent items this afternoon and the regular consent items tomorrow

01:32.460 --> 01:33.460
morning.

01:33.460 --> 01:39.100
In terms of public input, speakers should sign in at the table just outside the room.

01:39.100 --> 01:42.780
Speakers are on the table with separate pages for each item number.

01:42.780 --> 01:46.300
Signing in on the page that identifies the item number and what you would like to speak

01:46.300 --> 01:51.660
will help ensure that we keep track of all the speakers for each particular item.

01:51.660 --> 01:56.400
Item 16 is the general public comment item, during which members of the public may provide

01:56.400 --> 02:01.860
comment on items that are not specifically listed in the board's agenda.

02:01.860 --> 02:04.720
Public comment will be limited to one minute per speaker.

02:04.720 --> 02:08.420
In order to ensure that everyone gets their one minute, there is a timer at the podium

02:08.540 --> 02:14.860
that will flash a red signal to each speaker when the one minute time limit has been reached.

02:14.860 --> 02:18.820
And now I'd like to invite State Superintendent Thurmond to provide the superintendent's

02:18.820 --> 02:23.940
report.

02:23.940 --> 02:24.940
Thank you, Madam President.

02:24.940 --> 02:26.620
Welcome to our board meeting.

02:26.620 --> 02:33.540
I'm happy to share with you that we recently recognized over 2,000 educators at the Distinguished

02:33.540 --> 02:35.100
Schools Award.

02:35.180 --> 02:40.900
This is from all across our districts who have made performance in many categories.

02:40.900 --> 02:46.900
While we have many challenges in education, we have to start by acknowledging our successes

02:46.900 --> 02:53.820
and where we are making progress, and it was an honor to celebrate 2,000 awardees.

02:53.820 --> 02:59.420
Immediately on the heels of the Distinguished Schools Award celebration, we moved into a

02:59.420 --> 03:04.860
first ever equity conference where 1,000 educators came together to talk about our main priority

03:05.260 --> 03:10.060
at the California Department of Education, closing equity gaps and ensuring quality education

03:10.060 --> 03:14.240
for all students, regardless of their background, regardless of their neighborhood, regardless

03:14.240 --> 03:15.820
of their zip code.

03:15.820 --> 03:19.220
And I want to commend our teams who brought together all of our federal programs, all

03:19.220 --> 03:24.740
of our title programs, together under the banner of equity with great speakers and workshops

03:24.740 --> 03:28.980
and professional development for all of our teams.

03:29.020 --> 03:36.600
We are actively in a legislative cycle right now and budget season, continuing to work

03:36.600 --> 03:42.820
off of the proposed budget that the governor has put forward for us in January.

03:42.820 --> 03:48.480
Our teams have been active in working to process out and vet out some of the details of the

03:48.480 --> 03:50.600
things that are in the budget.

03:50.600 --> 03:56.420
Everything from the work really of our president on things like teacher recruitment and retention,

03:56.500 --> 04:01.860
how we improve special education and how we augment students who are homeless, have been

04:01.860 --> 04:05.420
impacted by trauma, who live in foster care.

04:05.420 --> 04:08.300
By that I'm speaking about the community schools program.

04:08.300 --> 04:14.180
And so our budget right now is being played out in the assembly and senate education budget

04:14.180 --> 04:18.100
committees and the staff at the Department of Education have been active in providing

04:18.100 --> 04:23.260
testimony on these bills, on these budget measures and on bills and have been working

04:23.300 --> 04:28.720
closely with the Department of Finance to start to fine tune some of these proposals

04:28.720 --> 04:34.900
and how they might look should they be enacted by the legislature and approved by the governor

04:34.900 --> 04:39.140
in May and in June when the budget process is complete.

04:39.140 --> 04:44.500
I'd like to talk with you about the thing that I suspect is on everyone's mind in America

04:44.500 --> 04:48.420
and in our world, the coronavirus.

04:48.580 --> 04:56.620
And I want you to know that California is leading as it relates to a strategy to address

04:56.620 --> 05:05.620
the impacts of the coronavirus and how we as the experts say, bend the curve to address

05:05.620 --> 05:09.580
the diagnoses, to address our response.

05:09.580 --> 05:14.900
And California has an incredible response team of experts from the fields of public

05:14.940 --> 05:19.580
health, from the office of emergency services and I want you to know that your team at

05:19.580 --> 05:23.940
the California Department of Education has been helping to lead this conversation as

05:23.940 --> 05:30.380
it relates to our 6 million students, our 10,000 schools and the family members and

05:30.380 --> 05:35.620
the community members who are impacted by everything that you can imagine.

05:35.620 --> 05:40.180
Every day we hear questions about closure and what should we do and when should closure

05:40.180 --> 05:46.420
happen and we've worked with our schools and our counties to say our framework for

05:46.420 --> 05:51.460
making those decisions is safety first, keeping our kids safe but we have to also balance

05:51.460 --> 05:53.020
that for many.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.820
School is the place where our students get a meal or as I'm reminded by some of our

05:56.820 --> 06:02.460
superintendents, three meals a day and so the Department of Education has been working

06:02.460 --> 06:06.780
with school districts that have closed to get the waivers that they need to provide

06:06.820 --> 06:12.260
meals to students in alternative locations throughout the communities where these schools

06:12.260 --> 06:13.620
have been closed.

06:13.620 --> 06:19.300
I'm grateful to our team at the California Department of Education who this week helped

06:19.300 --> 06:25.540
to co-convene a meeting with Governor Newsom and all 58 of our county superintendents to

06:25.540 --> 06:32.340
build a structure for how to support our schools, our superintendents, our districts on everything

06:32.340 --> 06:34.460
related to coronavirus.

06:34.500 --> 06:40.740
Our framework has been the same, to make sure that we talk about these issues in the context

06:40.740 --> 06:47.340
of local decision making, synchronized and coordinated with county public health departments

06:47.340 --> 06:52.620
who are working with county superintendents but with the support of the California Department

06:52.620 --> 06:58.140
of Education in helping to guide those decisions and yes, answering all the questions, the

06:58.140 --> 07:03.220
number one question that everyone asks about is when can we close and how will we handle

07:03.220 --> 07:07.660
the issues about attendance and can we do distance learning and I couldn't be more

07:07.660 --> 07:13.500
proud of our team at the California Department of Education for leading this conversation,

07:13.500 --> 07:17.420
working closely with our governor who is way out front on this, our governor has become

07:17.420 --> 07:22.140
an expert himself in talking about the things that we need to be doing, about how we can

07:22.140 --> 07:28.900
be smart and safe, how we can be calm and not reacting to rumor but facts but also taking

07:28.940 --> 07:37.340
steps and measures that are proven to mitigate and to prevent when possible exposure for

07:37.340 --> 07:38.900
our students and their families.

07:38.900 --> 07:43.460
I'd like to ask a few of our staff who have been working directly, we have one of our

07:43.460 --> 07:48.540
deputy superintendents is on a daily call with the governor's cabinet members, this

07:48.540 --> 07:52.860
has been a 24-7 thing, I want to ask deputy superintendent Lisa Constancio if she would

07:52.860 --> 07:57.300
please stand, she has been our point person and has been doing incredible work here, I

07:57.300 --> 08:01.620
want to acknowledge her.

08:01.620 --> 08:06.580
Working closely with her around coordination, around communication, she is single-handedly

08:06.580 --> 08:11.140
taking calls from all thousands of our school districts, deputy superintendent Kendra Britt

08:11.140 --> 08:16.300
who also has helped to lead this, I'd like to ask her to stand and be acknowledged.

08:16.300 --> 08:21.560
Our new chief deputy who you will hear about just a little bit more later has also been

08:21.560 --> 08:25.300
part of that coordination and I want to ask Dr. Stephanie Gregson to also stand and be

08:25.300 --> 08:29.900
acknowledged.

08:29.900 --> 08:34.020
In spite of the challenges that we must face as it relates to the coronavirus, we still

08:34.020 --> 08:39.060
have our mission of educating all of our kids from rural communities and frontier communities

08:39.060 --> 08:43.060
to urban communities to communities that are more impacted than others, we've got to make

08:43.060 --> 08:47.980
sure that we continue to have conversations about equity and your California Department

08:47.980 --> 08:51.660
of Education team has been at the forefront of these conversations.

08:51.660 --> 08:56.140
I'd like to also acknowledge the staff of the State Board of Education for their work

08:56.140 --> 09:01.720
and their guidance and for our State Board President Linda Darling-Hammond who also was

09:01.720 --> 09:07.300
part of this convening of 58 county superintendents whose leadership and the leadership of the

09:07.300 --> 09:12.180
State Board of Education has helped to provide guidance that we can provide to every district

09:12.180 --> 09:13.180
in this state.

09:13.180 --> 09:16.740
Now we can't answer every question that they're going to come up with, we cannot answer every

09:17.740 --> 09:22.300
that they might fear or anticipate, but what we've done is we've built the structure for

09:22.300 --> 09:27.640
how to work through it together, how to game plan through those systems together and so

09:27.640 --> 09:32.900
again I'd like to acknowledge everyone at the State Board of Education and our chair

09:32.900 --> 09:34.700
for our president for that work.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.900
Now I know that there's probably no one in the room from the State Board of Education

09:37.900 --> 09:41.140
but if you are, stand up, we'd like to applaud you as well.

09:41.140 --> 09:48.140
State Board of Education staff, come on, you're in the room.

09:48.140 --> 09:52.660
I was being, I was joking, I was a little sarcasm.

09:52.660 --> 09:58.860
I want to talk to you about some of the staff that will be introduced to you today from

09:58.860 --> 10:00.980
the California Department of Education.

10:00.980 --> 10:08.900
You'll hear about Dr. Stephanie Gregson who is taking over as our new chief deputy superintendent

10:09.140 --> 10:14.420
and if you don't know, she represents the first traditional educator in the role in

10:14.420 --> 10:18.780
more than 20 years, someone who's been in a classroom, someone who's been an administrator

10:18.780 --> 10:23.220
in a school, someone who's been an expert on literacy and has done a number of things

10:23.220 --> 10:25.220
here at the Department of Education.

10:25.220 --> 10:29.580
And so just a little bit later we'll say a little bit more about Dr. Gregson, but I want

10:29.580 --> 10:34.780
you to meet some other folks here at the department who are in new roles and who are continuing

10:35.100 --> 10:39.180
to provide excellence for the work that we are doing.

10:39.180 --> 10:44.500
I'd like to reintroduce for you, those of you who have not yet had the opportunity to

10:44.500 --> 10:46.380
meet Dr. Malvang.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.820
Is Dr. Malvang here?

10:48.820 --> 10:51.420
We want to congratulate Dr. Malvang.

10:51.420 --> 10:56.140
She is our new director of assessment, development and administration division.

10:56.140 --> 10:59.500
She brings a deep background in assessment.

10:59.500 --> 11:03.780
She also comes from the classroom and from working in local districts.

11:03.780 --> 11:09.020
She's been working here at CDE and is bringing a new passion to our leadership team as we

11:09.020 --> 11:13.300
have incredible conversations about assessment in our schools.

11:13.300 --> 11:17.580
Again, welcome to your new role, Dr. Malvang.

11:17.580 --> 11:22.580
A lot of what we do with districts is have conversations about their fiscal challenges.

11:22.580 --> 11:26.020
Let's be honest, their fiscal challenges are many.

11:26.060 --> 11:34.500
Many of our school districts are seeing deficits that are 30, 40 and 50 million dollars.

11:34.500 --> 11:38.580
Some of these are districts that have had strong fiscal controls for years.

11:38.580 --> 11:42.860
They simply cannot keep up with the rising costs of education.

11:42.860 --> 11:48.300
They simply cannot keep up with the costs of special education without more support

11:48.300 --> 11:50.500
from the federal government and from the state.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.460
They're dealing with rising costs related to pensions.

11:53.460 --> 11:56.140
They're dealing with rising costs related to healthcare.

11:56.140 --> 11:59.420
They're dealing with just about any scenario that you can imagine.

11:59.420 --> 12:05.540
Like every single district in our state, they're dealing with declining enrollment.

12:05.540 --> 12:07.460
Our districts face those challenges.

12:07.460 --> 12:11.740
We work with them to understand how local control funding works.

12:11.740 --> 12:17.460
We work with them when they experience power safety shutoffs or other crises that impact

12:17.460 --> 12:20.780
their traditional funding of education.

12:20.780 --> 12:25.540
We've got a new director who will oversee our School Fiscal Services Division to make

12:25.540 --> 12:26.540
that happen.

12:26.540 --> 12:32.620
She's no stranger to CDE as she's been working at CDE for 14 years in the School Fiscal Services

12:32.620 --> 12:33.860
Division.

12:33.860 --> 12:37.260
She will be continuing to lead us in that division.

12:37.260 --> 12:40.300
I'd like you to please help me welcome Elizabeth Bierstein.

12:40.300 --> 12:42.180
Is Elizabeth in the room?

12:42.180 --> 12:48.620
Stand by.

12:48.620 --> 12:53.780
She'll be prepared to answer all your questions about LCFF and the formulas.

12:53.780 --> 12:56.740
She's been coaching me up on all kinds of formulas.

12:56.740 --> 13:00.380
We are grateful to have her leadership.

13:00.380 --> 13:05.460
We have so many incredible leaders that I want you to meet.

13:05.460 --> 13:09.020
In this quarter, I commissioned a new ad hoc group.

13:09.060 --> 13:12.500
I call it the Superintendent State Advisory Council.

13:12.500 --> 13:19.060
We have some 15 superintendents from county offices, from districts, who are really thinking

13:19.060 --> 13:23.180
through with us some of the big challenges of the day.

13:23.180 --> 13:29.300
Many of them are leaders who come from districts who are recognized as bright spots, who found

13:29.300 --> 13:36.580
ways to improve graduation rates, to increase performance for students of color and students

13:36.580 --> 13:40.860
from low-income backgrounds and students who had other challenging experiences.

13:40.860 --> 13:42.140
Some of them are from large districts.

13:42.140 --> 13:44.420
Many of them are from small and rural districts.

13:44.420 --> 13:49.380
Together we're going to continue to shoulder the load of making sure that we provide a

13:49.380 --> 13:53.300
great quality education for our California students.

13:53.300 --> 13:58.300
So for now, I'll submit this as my report and then come back to you when we have an

13:58.300 --> 14:02.180
opportunity to speak in detail about our new Chief Deputy and swear her in.

14:02.180 --> 14:04.900
Thank you, Madam President and members of the board.

14:04.940 --> 14:05.940
Looking forward to that.

14:05.940 --> 14:06.940
Thank you.

14:06.940 --> 14:14.260
I want to just add my deepest appreciation to Tony and his team for all of the leadership

14:14.260 --> 14:22.140
that they've exerted around the coronavirus events and the leadership that they will provide

14:22.140 --> 14:25.260
as we go through this period of time together.

14:25.260 --> 14:31.580
I also want to thank the principals and teachers and school nurses and counselors and librarians

14:31.580 --> 14:35.500
and nutrition services workers and custodians and office managers, all of whom are going

14:35.500 --> 14:44.700
to be working around the clock in a variety of new and different ways to help keep our

14:44.700 --> 14:51.940
students safe, to ensure that their education proceeds during this period with a combination

14:51.940 --> 14:58.060
of in-classroom learning and well-scrubbed classrooms, distance learning, independent

14:58.100 --> 15:01.980
study, meal delivery, as the superintendent noted.

15:01.980 --> 15:04.940
I know there are a lot of anxious students and parents out there.

15:04.940 --> 15:11.260
I know our school staffs are doing the very best to maintain supportive learning environments.

15:11.260 --> 15:17.620
And I thank all of those administrators and teachers who are dealing with many, many questions

15:17.620 --> 15:23.060
and decisions around the virus and for keeping the lines of communication open and keeping

15:23.060 --> 15:24.500
everyone informed.

15:24.500 --> 15:30.220
I know our schools are in good hands, hands that are frequently washed for 20 seconds

15:30.220 --> 15:38.260
at a time, and that accurate and timely information is our best antidote to anxiety.

15:38.260 --> 15:41.780
Please check in with your colleagues, make sure that they're okay.

15:41.780 --> 15:45.060
It's an anxious time for educators as well.

15:45.060 --> 15:47.540
No hugs or handshakes, please.

15:47.540 --> 15:52.820
We'll be demonstrating the new California greeting in just a few moments so that we

15:53.140 --> 15:56.340
can all use it safely together.

15:56.340 --> 16:03.580
I'd also like to announce, sadly, the departure of David Sapp, who you may recall was announced

16:03.580 --> 16:04.580
as on leave.

16:04.580 --> 16:09.660
He has now become, he was the Deputy Policy Director and Assistant Legal Counsel at the

16:09.660 --> 16:15.660
State Board from January 2016 to February 2020, and he has accepted a position in the

16:15.660 --> 16:18.580
Governor's Office of Legal Affairs.

16:18.820 --> 16:25.020
Dave is responsible for a lot of the work that we enjoy and continue around the accountability

16:25.020 --> 16:26.660
system.

16:26.660 --> 16:32.820
He shepherded our ESSA state plan through to get the Department of Education's approval.

16:32.820 --> 16:37.940
He helped establish the framework for our statewide system of support, as well as providing

16:37.940 --> 16:40.540
legal support to the board.

16:40.540 --> 16:46.060
And we want to recognize his contributions and thank him for those contributions at this

16:46.060 --> 16:47.060
time.

16:47.060 --> 16:50.060
I have a little certificate for you.

17:17.060 --> 17:21.060
Thank you very much.

17:47.060 --> 17:51.340
So I'm going to start by, just as one of the board members, trying to make a couple

17:51.340 --> 17:52.340
of comments.

17:52.340 --> 17:53.340
So Dave, you were with us for four years.

17:53.340 --> 17:57.220
That's a really long time for us, and really, during some really important times.

17:57.220 --> 18:01.540
I just want to say I can remember sitting in your office drawing pictures of the dashboard

18:01.540 --> 18:06.540
on the wall as we started to think about how we were going to report our new accountability

18:06.540 --> 18:07.540
system.

18:07.540 --> 18:12.620
And you've been so involved intimately with all the details of the processes that we are

18:12.620 --> 18:13.620
now fully implementing.

18:13.860 --> 18:18.260
And I just want to personally thank you for your thoroughness, your thoughtfulness, always

18:18.260 --> 18:22.940
responding, glad to follow up on emails, always willing to take a call.

18:22.940 --> 18:27.060
And I just think you guided us through a lot in the four years you were with us.

18:27.060 --> 18:31.060
And I'm excited for you for your next chapter, but hopefully you'll stay connected.

18:31.060 --> 18:35.440
And we heard that you're definitely willing to be a tour guide in Napa if we're interested

18:35.440 --> 18:36.440
in coming up to visit.

18:36.440 --> 18:41.040
But I just want to personally thank you for the work that you gave in support of the staff

18:41.040 --> 18:43.220
and the board during the last four years.

18:43.220 --> 18:44.220
We're going to really miss you.

18:44.220 --> 18:45.220
Thanks.

18:51.220 --> 18:52.220
Any other comments?

18:52.220 --> 18:53.220
All right.

18:53.220 --> 18:54.220
I also.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.220
Yes, go ahead.

18:55.220 --> 19:00.260
Well, I was just going to add to the comment that another major project that Dave spearheaded

19:00.260 --> 19:04.060
for the board was the ESSA plan.

19:04.060 --> 19:11.380
And just going through that, having been the liaison to the plan, David, just balancing

19:11.380 --> 19:17.620
the legal, the policies of California and the requirements at the federal level was

19:17.620 --> 19:26.740
just amazing and really appreciated all you have done for us in that area.

19:26.740 --> 19:31.180
So this is a time of arrivals and departures.

19:31.180 --> 19:37.580
And we have two additional state board members whose terms have been completed to whom we

19:37.580 --> 19:39.320
are enormously grateful.

19:39.320 --> 19:44.800
We want to take this opportunity to thank state board members Ortiz-Lacon and Sandoval

19:44.800 --> 19:47.960
for their years of service on this board.

19:47.960 --> 19:53.600
In particular, I want to thank member Ortiz-Lacon for serving on the state board screening committee,

19:53.600 --> 19:59.840
our liaison on English learner issues, liaison on two of the curriculum areas, including

19:59.840 --> 20:03.000
the health framework and ethnic studies.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.160
So yeah, right.

20:06.160 --> 20:12.200
And finally, liaisons of the California Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory Committee and being

20:12.200 --> 20:17.400
a passionate advocate for our students, particularly our students who are furthest from opportunity

20:17.400 --> 20:18.400
in this state.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.240
So thank you very much.

20:20.240 --> 20:26.920
Let's take a moment and appreciate.

20:26.920 --> 20:32.680
And then I'm also going to announce and then we'll go around and take recognitions.

20:32.680 --> 20:38.320
Member Sandoval, Nikki Sandoval, for being our liaison on special education.

20:38.320 --> 20:43.040
She covered the advisory committee on special education, two curriculum areas of history,

20:43.040 --> 20:45.760
social science, visual and performing arts.

20:45.760 --> 20:51.120
She's been our liaison to the summer school for the arts and also a passionate advocate

20:51.120 --> 20:53.040
for students.

20:53.040 --> 20:56.280
And her time has been immensely appreciated.

20:56.280 --> 20:57.760
We will miss you both.

20:57.800 --> 21:04.320
I want to welcome, before I give you your very fancy certificates, I would like to welcome

21:04.320 --> 21:07.720
our colleagues to add their words of appreciation.

21:07.720 --> 21:12.640
Well, so I just have to say, so let me start with Nikki says, I think it's seven years,

21:12.640 --> 21:15.160
right, that you're completing your service.

21:15.160 --> 21:19.960
And that's a long convoluted drive and flight from Lumpook.

21:19.960 --> 21:23.520
I don't know if anyone realizes how, what it takes for Nikki to get here.

21:23.520 --> 21:28.720
But I think it's a drive, a train, a couple of planes, and she makes it every time.

21:28.720 --> 21:33.680
And I just have to say, Nikki has been, you've been consistent, you're thoughtful.

21:33.680 --> 21:37.400
When you make comments, they really have, they're really important voice.

21:37.400 --> 21:42.160
And the work in special ed and the work that you've done, it just has really been an important

21:42.160 --> 21:43.680
voice here on the board.

21:43.680 --> 21:47.560
And I just have to say, like, I just so appreciate getting a chance to work with you and getting

21:47.560 --> 21:48.560
to know you.

21:49.040 --> 21:53.920
Both of us lecture at the University of California, and I just have appreciated her collaboration

21:53.920 --> 21:56.520
and as a colleague and just for being part of the team.

21:56.520 --> 22:00.000
And for Felisa, like, your energy is amazing.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.880
And I just have to say, I love her energy, her thoughtfulness.

22:02.880 --> 22:07.680
She's busy traveling around the country doing her important work for her day job, and yet

22:07.680 --> 22:13.840
always has time to take time, spend time getting into the agenda, really looking at the issues,

22:13.840 --> 22:14.840
really thoughtful.

22:14.920 --> 22:19.240
I've had the fortunate of Felisa's poke into my graduate class and has been such a model

22:19.240 --> 22:22.800
for leadership and for improvement for students.

22:22.800 --> 22:27.920
And I just, that hopefully, that we will be long term friends and colleagues.

22:27.920 --> 22:32.280
But it's just been a really important voice, and I just so appreciate that you found time.

22:32.280 --> 22:36.240
I know your family has wished you weren't always coming to Sacramento, but we just so

22:36.240 --> 22:40.400
appreciate that you've been able to find time to do that, and I look forward to celebrating

22:40.400 --> 22:42.840
with you guys soon, thanks.

22:44.840 --> 22:58.360
Hello, I just wanted to thank both of you for serving as such a great example for young

22:58.360 --> 23:04.160
students across California and specifically young women who are trying to get into leadership.

23:04.160 --> 23:09.080
Both of your unique perspectives and the passion you bring definitely, I think, inspires a

23:09.080 --> 23:12.040
lot of people to talk about the issues that really matter.

23:12.040 --> 23:16.120
So thank you so much for the example that you've set for children across the state.

23:20.840 --> 23:26.120
And I will open the floor if there's anybody from the public who wants to make any commentary.

23:29.640 --> 23:30.600
All right, it's time.

23:38.600 --> 23:39.400
Thank you very much.

23:39.400 --> 23:43.800
I've had an opportunity to express my personal gratitude to individuals who I've been in

23:43.800 --> 23:49.640
service with, and kakinalin, that means I am grateful to you, and I mean to my colleagues

23:49.640 --> 23:52.840
here on the board, and also to our stakeholders.

23:52.840 --> 23:57.920
You are such an important part of the work that we do, and I'm just so grateful to you.

23:57.920 --> 24:02.560
I'm also grateful to the department staff, the state board staff.

24:02.560 --> 24:08.520
I also want to shout out to the young people who come to every meeting.

24:08.520 --> 24:11.080
I always worry, why aren't you in school?

24:11.080 --> 24:18.600
But once that kind of wears off, I listen carefully, and I'm really touched by the testimony

24:18.600 --> 24:22.680
that you offer about the impacts of our decisions on your lives.

24:22.680 --> 24:24.320
So thank you for that.

24:24.320 --> 24:30.200
And I also want to acknowledge the people whose warmth and support keeps things going.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.800
They're the people that you see, you don't see.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.680
They're behind the scenes, keeping the machine moving.

24:35.680 --> 24:42.160
Lisa Hopkins, Malia Goncalves, Amy Bubbaco in the state board office.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.600
You're fantastic, and thank you for all that you do.

24:44.600 --> 24:48.400
I just wanted to publicly name and thank you.

24:48.400 --> 24:53.600
And also our audio visual technicians, the people in the booth.

24:53.600 --> 24:58.880
You don't know this, they're not only phenomenal technicians, but they're accomplished musicians.

24:59.520 --> 25:06.520
Derrick, George, Clayton, Sasha, I just want to give you a big thanks.

25:06.520 --> 25:09.600
And we're all here united for the good.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.240
Your hearts are good.

25:11.240 --> 25:15.400
Kakinush, and that in my language, the Somali language, means thank you.

25:15.400 --> 25:26.200
Ditto to all of that.

25:26.200 --> 25:31.840
And I just want to add, of course, you know, I've always used this as a platform to give

25:31.840 --> 25:37.080
a message to those that support me and I support and to lift other voices.

25:37.080 --> 25:39.520
But today I'm going to lift my own voice.

25:39.520 --> 25:42.160
I started this journey five years ago.

25:42.160 --> 25:47.560
And when I came in, I came in with six family members for two minutes wherein.

25:47.560 --> 25:51.040
And I know that many of you remember that.

25:51.040 --> 25:57.440
I followed that up with having 18 family and close friends for my Senate confirmation.

25:57.440 --> 26:03.000
And I know that that sounded a little excessive, but not in the Latino community.

26:03.000 --> 26:08.820
In the Latino community, we call that colectivismo, which is being part of the collective.

26:08.860 --> 26:13.660
And this journey has always been of many for many.

26:13.660 --> 26:20.620
So and I'm sorry, it is emotional because it is personal.

26:20.620 --> 26:25.900
I want to acknowledge those that today my entourage is a lot smaller, but still powerful.

26:25.900 --> 26:30.780
I want to acknowledge my cousin, Justice Miguel Marquez, who's here today with me, my best

26:30.780 --> 26:35.720
friend, Jessica Guzman Green, who knows me since high school, ninth grade, to be exact,

26:35.720 --> 26:40.920
and who serves the community as a clinical social worker.

26:40.920 --> 26:45.960
My former colleague, Choco Leandro, who is a lifetime educator in Texas and nationally

26:45.960 --> 26:50.120
with Unidos U.S. and her husband, Judge Bob Foster.

26:50.120 --> 26:51.800
Thank you for being here today.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.800
Thank you for being part of this journey.

26:53.800 --> 26:57.960
I know that they bring the spirit of many who are not here physically today, including

26:57.960 --> 27:01.080
my husband and my two kids.

27:01.720 --> 27:09.960
I have to bring them to this space because as Eileen mentioned, sorry, Board Member Strauss,

27:09.960 --> 27:11.360
I travel quite a bit for work.

27:11.360 --> 27:16.040
I work for a civil rights Latino serving organization called Unidos U.S.

27:16.040 --> 27:23.160
So we travel quite a bit and this appointment added about 15 trips or so a year to my schedule.

27:23.160 --> 27:26.920
And there was times where my kids had a really hard time with that because I couldn't do

27:26.920 --> 27:27.920
homework with them.

27:27.920 --> 27:30.000
I couldn't tuck them into bed.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.040
I couldn't read with them.

27:32.040 --> 27:36.600
But one of the things that my husband and I have always told our kids is that this work

27:36.600 --> 27:39.800
for us is part of our legacy.

27:39.800 --> 27:44.520
My parents immigrated to this country to provide better opportunities for the kids and top

27:44.520 --> 27:47.640
of list was a quality education.

27:47.640 --> 27:53.300
So for me, this work has always been my lifetime mission and it will continue because it's

27:53.300 --> 27:55.320
not bounded by an appointment.

27:55.320 --> 27:59.960
It is the work that needs to continue because our students have not been fully served yet.

28:00.960 --> 28:05.640
I look forward to working with all of you in this journey to make sure that equity

28:05.640 --> 28:09.040
is tangible and actionable for our students.

28:09.040 --> 28:13.040
I look forward to working with all of you and holding the friendships that I was able

28:13.040 --> 28:14.360
to develop.

28:14.360 --> 28:19.840
I came to Sacramento knowing no one except the entourage that came with me that day.

28:19.840 --> 28:22.020
And I'm leaving with a lot of friendships.

28:22.020 --> 28:27.240
So I want to thank the department, the state board staff, everyone that, all the AV guys,

28:27.240 --> 28:31.000
they never brought that filter that I asked, but thank you.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.040
I always tell them to put a little extra filter and they didn't.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.120
But I want to thank them.

28:36.120 --> 28:41.880
I want to thank the organizations, the advocates, the students that come before us because it

28:41.880 --> 28:45.880
matters to them and it should matter to us as well as I know it will.

28:45.880 --> 28:50.880
State Superintendent Tony Thurman, I want to lead your Latinx advisory council, which

28:50.880 --> 28:51.880
I know you don't have.

28:51.880 --> 28:52.880
I'm proposing it.

28:52.880 --> 28:56.400
And I'm not proposing it that I lead it.

28:56.400 --> 29:01.360
I believe California needs to be unapologetic about properly serving their Latino majority

29:01.360 --> 29:02.360
students.

29:02.360 --> 29:03.360
And I look forward.

29:03.360 --> 29:04.360
Let's just make it so.

29:04.360 --> 29:05.360
Let's just make it so.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.360
We'll do it.

29:06.360 --> 29:07.360
Well, we're going to elbow on it.

29:07.360 --> 29:08.360
We're going to elbow on it.

29:08.360 --> 29:13.240
I'm going to leave you with a quote from a friend that I met through this work here in

29:13.240 --> 29:17.960
Sacramento and she texted me and I've received a lot of outpour of support from folks as

29:17.960 --> 29:20.680
they're learning that my appointment has come to an end.

29:20.680 --> 29:25.240
And she said, Felisa, you are there to protect the trees.

29:25.240 --> 29:27.960
You are the Lorax and our kids need you.

29:27.960 --> 29:28.960
They are the trees.

29:28.960 --> 29:32.640
So I'm going to leave you with a quote from Dr. Seuss and that book.

29:32.640 --> 29:37.400
Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better.

29:37.400 --> 29:38.600
It's not.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.680
The work ahead is tough.

29:40.680 --> 29:45.800
It has been my privilege and honor to serve the 6.2 million students of California and

29:45.800 --> 29:47.040
their families.

29:47.040 --> 29:49.600
And I look forward to collaborating with you in the work ahead.

29:49.600 --> 29:50.100
Thank you.

29:56.240 --> 30:05.240
I would just like to add that for both members Sandoval and Ortiz-Lacon, all of the liaison

30:05.240 --> 30:13.000
work and committee work that you've done has been enormous, both in quantity and impact.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.580
And both of these wonderful board members have offered to continue to help us.

30:17.580 --> 30:19.640
We have specific ideas for that.

30:19.640 --> 30:25.760
So I really, really appreciate the fact that you will be continuing to serve the 6.2 million

30:25.760 --> 30:28.120
students of California.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.160
So let's get some photos.

33:19.640 --> 33:41.720
Thank you so much.

33:41.720 --> 33:45.800
What a good start to the day.

33:45.800 --> 33:49.000
Moving on to agenda item one.

33:49.240 --> 33:54.200
Item one is the appointment of Stephanie Gregson to the Chief Deputy Superintendent of Public

33:54.200 --> 33:56.520
Instruction.

33:56.520 --> 34:02.080
The Department of Education recommends that we appoint a new Chief Deputy Superintendent

34:02.080 --> 34:08.440
of Public Instruction in accordance with Article 9, Section 2.1 of the Constitution of the

34:08.440 --> 34:09.880
State of California.

34:09.880 --> 34:12.680
This item is presented by State Superintendent Thurmond.

34:12.680 --> 34:14.680
You may begin.

34:14.680 --> 34:16.800
Thank you Madam President and board members.

34:16.800 --> 34:25.320
Today I represent to you Dr. Stephanie Gregson, who will serve as our new Chief Deputy Superintendent.

34:25.320 --> 34:27.600
It is a very unique role.

34:27.600 --> 34:35.240
It is, in my estimation, part educator, part administrator, and you have to have a kind

34:35.240 --> 34:40.400
of political acumen to understand all the things that are happening around you.

34:40.400 --> 34:44.160
Stephanie possesses all those skills.

34:44.160 --> 34:50.360
As I mentioned, she is the first traditional educator to serve in the role as Chief Deputy

34:50.360 --> 34:52.840
in more than two decades.

34:52.840 --> 34:59.000
After spending 10 years as an elementary school teacher, after serving as a district coordinator

34:59.000 --> 35:06.400
for reading and intervention, after serving as a director of curriculum and assessment,

35:06.400 --> 35:12.520
she brings many, many relevant skills as an educator and as an administrator.

35:12.520 --> 35:17.560
She has served at the California Department of Education for just about four years in

35:17.560 --> 35:25.920
a number of roles, not the least of which is overseeing our work in the curriculum frameworks,

35:25.920 --> 35:32.120
health frameworks, computer science standards.

35:32.120 --> 35:35.960
Coming to the Department of Education, the thing that I probably underestimated as being

35:35.960 --> 35:41.920
the biggest challenge are the conversations about what goes in our curricula.

35:41.920 --> 35:48.400
We have seen the kind of difficulty and challenges that can come with that great opportunity,

35:48.400 --> 35:54.080
and Stephanie has really been, I would say, tested in her ability to manage that and to

35:54.080 --> 36:01.800
manage how we include the voice of all in our conversations about what goes in our curricula.

36:01.800 --> 36:06.880
She will tell you someday about her superpower.

36:06.880 --> 36:13.260
When she is not leading in education, she runs marathons.

36:13.260 --> 36:19.120
She finds time to be a mom and a wife and to work with her family and a coach to two

36:19.120 --> 36:24.820
great kids, two scholar-athletes who we get to hear often about and who you'll get to

36:24.820 --> 36:26.320
meet today.

36:26.320 --> 36:30.900
What I appreciate about Stephanie is that upon my arrival when she was serving as a

36:30.900 --> 36:41.260
division director, she heard the call for us to do all we can to be a big agency that

36:41.260 --> 36:45.300
delivers special touch to all of our students.

36:45.300 --> 36:47.260
It's a special way that we do it, though.

36:47.260 --> 36:53.160
We're not a local district, and so the work that we do has to be facilitative.

36:53.160 --> 36:56.140
That means we have to be responsive to the needs of districts.

36:56.140 --> 36:59.220
That means we have to look through the lens of what's best for students in everything

36:59.220 --> 37:02.760
that we do, and Stephanie has that vision.

37:02.760 --> 37:07.580
She has a vision for how we'll support all six million of our students as we support

37:07.580 --> 37:13.300
our districts, as they become those that we serve, how we offer support and assistance

37:13.300 --> 37:19.220
to them in addition to compliance and monitoring, in addition to all the things that have to

37:19.220 --> 37:24.160
happen administratively behind the scenes for the California Department of Education.

37:24.160 --> 37:30.440
At the end of the day, it is about ensuring great quality education for our educators.

37:30.440 --> 37:36.480
She has a master's degree in educational leadership, a doctorate degree in curriculum instruction

37:36.480 --> 37:42.340
and assessment, but more important, she has the heart, the passion, and the vision for

37:42.340 --> 37:49.760
serving California kids, and I'm honored to have her serve as our partner, my partner

37:49.760 --> 37:53.560
in the work in delivering for California's education.

37:53.720 --> 38:00.240
I'm going to swear her in now, but I'd like to ask for her family members who are present

38:00.240 --> 38:01.720
to come forward.

38:01.720 --> 38:11.100
Today, she is joined by her parents, Stan and Diana Britt, her husband, Jeff Gregson,

38:11.100 --> 38:15.360
and her two children, Nicholas and Madison Gregson.

38:15.360 --> 38:19.040
Please welcome the Gregson and Britt family as they come forward for swearing in.

38:19.640 --> 38:31.680
I think we have to vote on it first.

38:31.680 --> 38:34.160
Just one moment.

38:34.160 --> 38:35.760
Just kidding.

38:35.760 --> 38:37.760
I move approval.

38:37.760 --> 38:40.560
Yes, I move approval.

38:40.560 --> 38:41.560
I second.

38:41.560 --> 38:42.560
Thank you very much.

38:42.560 --> 38:43.560
Any further discussion?

38:43.560 --> 38:44.560
All in favor say aye.

38:44.560 --> 38:45.560
Any opposed say nay.

38:45.560 --> 38:46.560
Any abstentions?

38:46.560 --> 38:47.560
Congratulations.

38:47.680 --> 38:48.680
Any abstentions?

38:48.680 --> 38:49.680
Congratulations.

38:49.680 --> 38:50.680
Come on up.

38:50.680 --> 38:51.680
Thank you for the vote.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.680
It's all over but the shouting.

38:53.680 --> 38:57.680
Okay.

39:17.680 --> 39:43.680
Please raise your right hand.

39:43.680 --> 39:44.680
Aye.

39:44.680 --> 39:45.680
State your name.

39:45.680 --> 39:46.680
Aye.

39:46.800 --> 39:56.040
Do solemnly swear or affirm that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United

39:56.040 --> 40:06.720
States and the Constitution of the State of California against all enemies, foreign and

40:06.720 --> 40:14.000
domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United

40:14.000 --> 40:24.320
States and the Constitution of the State of California without any mental reservation

40:24.320 --> 40:33.920
or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which

40:33.920 --> 40:36.920
I'm about to enter.

40:36.920 --> 40:37.920
Congratulations.

40:37.920 --> 40:38.920
Thank you.

40:44.000 --> 40:50.560
Thank you.

40:50.560 --> 40:55.240
I wouldn't be a teacher if I didn't have a few words to say.

40:55.240 --> 41:00.200
When I started teaching in the 97-98 school year, I didn't even remotely understand the

41:00.200 --> 41:03.080
magnitude of the work done at the state level.

41:03.080 --> 41:08.880
I was solely focused on the 33 students in front of me and making sure I wore matching

41:08.880 --> 41:10.160
shoes every day.

41:10.160 --> 41:12.640
Yes, there's a story there.

41:12.680 --> 41:17.680
I'm a strong believer of trusting the journey, but I never dreamed my journey would lead

41:17.680 --> 41:20.000
me to this humbling opportunity.

41:20.000 --> 41:25.120
I knew when I was in first grade that I wanted to be a teacher, and every step I made was

41:25.120 --> 41:30.640
towards the goal of becoming a teacher that provided all my students an environment where

41:30.640 --> 41:36.520
they could thrive under an umbrella of love, trust, and no barriers.

41:36.520 --> 41:41.240
My journey has been shaped by several influencers.

41:41.240 --> 41:43.280
First and foremost, my parents.

41:43.280 --> 41:50.640
My parents taught me grit, perseverance, love, and kindness, each in their own way.

41:50.640 --> 41:55.100
As the first college graduate in my family, their lessons were invaluable.

41:55.100 --> 42:00.440
My husband, Jeff, and my children, Nicholas and Mattis, have filled my journey with true

42:00.440 --> 42:05.320
and unconditional love, pride, and so much joy.

42:05.320 --> 42:11.200
My best friend, Lisa, and my tribe brought authentic friendship and depth to my journey.

42:11.200 --> 42:15.640
The students I have had the honor and privilege of serving over the years, whether it was

42:15.640 --> 42:22.160
my classes of 33, schools of over 800, or a district of almost 10,000, they all gave

42:22.160 --> 42:26.080
my journey the purpose of serving and supporting.

42:26.080 --> 42:30.540
Thank you to all for shaping my journey in such a profound way.

42:30.540 --> 42:35.940
This new role provides me with excitement and trepidation all at the same time.

42:35.940 --> 42:40.140
I am excited to be working alongside a state superintendent who is willing to challenge

42:40.140 --> 42:46.100
the status quo, ask the hard questions, have the courageous conversations, and disrupt

42:46.100 --> 42:51.340
the systemic inequities to ensure all our students have the opportunity for success.

42:51.340 --> 42:56.520
A superintendent who always puts students' interests first and ensures that it is the

42:56.520 --> 43:00.260
lens and framework we use in making our decisions.

43:00.260 --> 43:06.300
I have some apprehension only because I understand the magnitude of the work and the urgency

43:06.300 --> 43:13.140
of which we need to act in supporting the adults and students in our educational system.

43:13.140 --> 43:18.860
This is a time for healing and for breaking down the barriers, even if we built them ourselves,

43:18.860 --> 43:21.740
that are impeding student-adult success.

43:21.740 --> 43:28.060
As a teacher, principal, district, and state leader, I have always started my work by asking

43:28.380 --> 43:32.260
what our students need from the adults so they can succeed.

43:32.260 --> 43:36.940
I am so honored to take on this new role and the responsibility that comes with it.

43:36.940 --> 43:41.560
You can all expect to see more collaboration among adults, organizations, and communities

43:41.560 --> 43:44.220
that put our students at the center.

43:44.220 --> 43:48.980
To provide every child in California with what we need, we will have to heal from past

43:48.980 --> 43:53.000
wounds, create new agreements, and behave in new ways.

43:53.000 --> 43:59.280
As chief deputy, I see my role as a lead learner, convener, and facilitator, ensuring all students

43:59.280 --> 44:04.960
in California are well-known, well-cared for, and well-prepared for the future.

44:04.960 --> 44:08.080
That will require all of us to work in new ways.

44:08.080 --> 44:12.200
The California Department of Education is an amazing team that has an opportunity in

44:12.200 --> 44:17.760
this moment of time to lead this work and to model how to support our counties, districts,

44:17.760 --> 44:22.360
and schools in their work to helping all our students achieve and find their success.

44:22.440 --> 44:28.400
I'm honored, humbled, and excited to be the first educator chief deputy in over 20 years

44:28.400 --> 44:32.720
and lead the CDE with our state superintendent, Tony Thurman, in this work.

44:32.720 --> 44:38.320
We will need all of us, as our education system will only thrive with collaboration and partnership

44:38.320 --> 44:43.840
within our schools and agencies, between our schools and agencies, and with all of our partners.

44:43.840 --> 44:48.280
It is with esteemed gratitude that I take on this new role and take the next step in

44:48.280 --> 44:50.920
this journey I started 22 years ago.

44:50.920 --> 44:55.160
I know that I'm not alone, as I'm on this journey with all of you and all of the children

44:55.160 --> 45:00.440
and families of California, and I hold myself accountable to share in their successes and

45:00.440 --> 45:02.360
challenges along the way.

45:02.360 --> 45:04.440
Thank you so much.

45:04.520 --> 45:14.760
Applause

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Do you have a phone or do you want me to take it and send it to you?

45:33.000 --> 45:35.960
Yeah, I'll send it to you.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Thank you.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.960
Your family and your friends.

47:03.800 --> 47:07.800
Hey, congratulations.

47:11.800 --> 47:13.800
It's all downhill from here.

47:16.920 --> 47:19.000
All these wonderful recognitions.

47:19.000 --> 47:24.520
Now we've got to get down to the work, but I don't want the staff who are presenting

47:24.520 --> 47:30.840
the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act item to feel underappreciated, so we do want

47:30.920 --> 47:34.200
to bring them up for agenda item number two.

47:36.360 --> 47:40.840
This is the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act item.

47:41.400 --> 47:46.360
The CDE recommends that we approve the skills attainment for upward mobility, align services

47:46.360 --> 47:52.600
for shared prosperity, workforce development plan for 2020 through 2023.

47:52.600 --> 47:58.280
Under the Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act of 2014, this item will be presented by

47:58.280 --> 48:04.520
Tim Rainey, Executive Director of the California Workforce Development Board, followed by Carolyn

48:04.520 --> 48:08.440
Zachary, Administrator of the Adult Education Office at CDE.

48:09.400 --> 48:12.280
So Tim, when you're ready, please begin.

48:19.240 --> 48:19.960
I think it's okay.

48:19.960 --> 48:22.040
You might want to pull it up close to your mouth.

48:22.040 --> 48:23.800
Yeah, no.

48:36.680 --> 48:37.400
Thank you.

48:37.400 --> 48:39.400
Yeah, I thought I'd get it started off with a bang.

48:41.160 --> 48:47.160
I embody it's downhill from here, so I'm happy to present.

48:48.040 --> 48:51.800
It was an incredibly moving morning.

48:52.520 --> 48:53.720
I'm so glad I got here on time.

48:53.720 --> 48:54.520
Well, almost on time.

48:56.440 --> 49:02.520
It was incredible to hear all of the personal stories and how connected everybody is to the

49:02.520 --> 49:03.640
work that we're doing.

49:04.440 --> 49:06.920
I was on my way downtown.

49:06.920 --> 49:10.600
My daughter, she's taking me places these days because we're sharing a car.

49:12.360 --> 49:15.080
And I'm late and I'm full of anxiety.

49:15.080 --> 49:15.800
I'm always late.

49:16.520 --> 49:17.720
And I'm practicing.

49:17.720 --> 49:19.000
And she says, what are you doing, Dad?

49:19.720 --> 49:22.280
And I said, I'm presenting to the State Board of Education.

49:22.840 --> 49:24.120
And she said, that's impressive.

49:27.640 --> 49:28.140
Thanks.

49:30.280 --> 49:31.640
Glad we could do that for you.

49:33.560 --> 49:37.000
And she said, because you dropped out of high school.

49:37.560 --> 49:40.280
And I said, thanks for the pep talk, honey.

49:40.280 --> 49:41.080
I appreciate that.

49:42.040 --> 49:45.560
But I think it is impressive.

49:45.560 --> 49:47.080
And thank you very much for this opportunity.

49:47.800 --> 49:50.200
Fremont Adult School saved my life.

49:50.200 --> 49:54.760
It gave me a chance to get back on my educational path.

49:54.760 --> 49:58.760
And the community college system in California is the best in the world, as far as I know.

49:58.760 --> 50:01.720
And it was a big part of my journey.

50:02.680 --> 50:05.640
So I want to say to the kids in the room, because I think there are some, don't drop

50:05.640 --> 50:06.120
out of high school.

50:06.120 --> 50:06.920
It's not the easy path.

50:07.480 --> 50:08.760
There are definitely easier ways to go.

50:09.400 --> 50:17.560
I want to quickly acknowledge the fact that I spoke to the Workforce Pathways Joint Committee

50:17.560 --> 50:18.840
just a few weeks ago.

50:19.640 --> 50:24.840
And I want to apologize to Ting Sun, because she has to sit through my presentation a second

50:24.840 --> 50:25.400
time.

50:25.400 --> 50:27.080
And I know that's very difficult to do.

50:27.720 --> 50:32.200
I also want to acknowledge that the Honorable Tony Thurman sits on the State Workforce

50:32.200 --> 50:33.000
Development Board.

50:33.000 --> 50:37.560
And he has to sit through it if he comes back a second time next week, because we present

50:37.560 --> 50:40.200
to the State Workforce Development Board.

50:40.200 --> 50:43.080
But if he doesn't come back, then he doesn't have to suffer through it a second time.

50:43.080 --> 50:43.640
We're good to go.

50:45.000 --> 50:48.360
I have a lot of content to move through, so I'm going to go pretty fast, because I want

50:48.360 --> 50:49.720
to respect everybody's time.

50:50.760 --> 50:58.680
I was last here in January 2015, I believe, presenting on the first State Strategic Workforce

50:58.680 --> 51:01.720
Development Plan for the Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act.

51:01.720 --> 51:04.280
And that plan was from 2017 to 2020.

51:04.840 --> 51:07.160
So we're back with a brand new State Strategic Plan.

51:07.160 --> 51:09.960
Only the second under the Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act.

51:11.640 --> 51:15.800
Before I launch in, I wonder if it's – should I say something about the State Workforce

51:15.800 --> 51:16.200
Board?

51:16.200 --> 51:18.360
It might be helpful for folks in the room.

51:18.360 --> 51:23.880
Then very briefly, the State Workforce Development Board is required of every state that receives

51:24.520 --> 51:28.360
the Federal Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act money, which is every state.

51:29.160 --> 51:35.640
We have a – by statutory requirement, federal statute, we have 51 percent business on our

51:35.720 --> 51:37.160
board, a majority on the board.

51:37.160 --> 51:40.840
We have a 43-person board, so it's wonderful to see you guys.

51:40.840 --> 51:42.520
This is such a manageable size.

51:42.520 --> 51:45.240
I don't know why anybody would have a 43-member board.

51:47.080 --> 51:51.160
Fifty-one percent business majority, appointed by the governor, Governor Newsom.

51:51.880 --> 51:56.440
Two members from the assembly and two members from the Senate that are appointed by legislative

51:56.440 --> 51:56.920
leadership.

51:57.640 --> 52:00.040
Community-based organizations, also appointed by the governor.

52:00.600 --> 52:04.360
And at least 15 percent labor representation, labor organizations on the board.

52:04.360 --> 52:06.760
That's actually by state statute, not by federal statute.

52:07.480 --> 52:08.520
And then state partners.

52:09.160 --> 52:15.000
All of the components of the workforce system, all of the departments and agencies that

52:15.000 --> 52:20.360
represent the big investment in California are also on the State Workforce Development

52:20.360 --> 52:26.280
Board by federal statute, but also by choice because we have a much broader representation

52:26.280 --> 52:28.360
than required in the federal law.

52:29.080 --> 52:31.160
And as I said, the superintendent is on the state board.

52:32.120 --> 52:37.080
So now Patricia Rucker has to sit through my presentation two times, so I apologize

52:37.800 --> 52:38.280
about that.

52:42.440 --> 52:50.520
The State Workforce Board is primarily charged with the alignment of the workforce development

52:50.520 --> 52:51.480
system in the state.

52:52.280 --> 52:54.520
That's our main charge.

52:54.600 --> 53:02.200
Under a single vision, among all the system components driven by the governor, but also

53:02.200 --> 53:06.760
in collaboration with the state legislature, and common strategies.

53:06.760 --> 53:09.000
And I'll talk about the vision and common strategies in a bit.

53:09.720 --> 53:12.280
The intent is to make it more navigable.

53:12.280 --> 53:14.120
It's a patchwork system.

53:14.120 --> 53:17.880
It's difficult for workers and students to find their way through it.

53:18.760 --> 53:21.160
And it's also difficult for businesses to navigate.

53:21.160 --> 53:25.400
Businesses that need to find talent in a skilled workforce.

53:26.280 --> 53:30.600
We need to get it aligned for that reason, but also to get scale and impact.

53:30.600 --> 53:35.960
It's a big investment, but when it's patchwork like this, we don't get the kind of scale

53:35.960 --> 53:40.280
and impact to really move employment in the state of California.

53:40.280 --> 53:42.280
So that's our main charge, this alignment piece.

53:43.800 --> 53:47.960
The vision and the strategies are expressed in the state strategic plan, which I'm sure

53:47.960 --> 53:52.120
you read last night, because it's a real page-turner, and it's the one thing that

53:52.120 --> 53:53.080
will keep you awake at night.

53:55.320 --> 53:57.240
So ask any detailed questions you want to.

53:59.080 --> 54:03.080
The draft plan was approved.

54:03.080 --> 54:04.040
It's before you now.

54:04.040 --> 54:04.760
I'll talk about it.

54:05.320 --> 54:11.720
It was approved by our executive committee last week, and it's here for your review and

54:11.800 --> 54:18.360
comment, and we'll take it to our full board next week, on Tuesday actually, for review

54:18.360 --> 54:23.400
and approval, and then it goes to the governor for final approval, and then off to the U.S.

54:23.400 --> 54:27.160
Department of Labor for their review.

54:27.160 --> 54:30.200
And they usually kick it back to us, and we do a little back and forth with the federal

54:30.200 --> 54:32.360
government until we get a finalized plan.

54:33.560 --> 54:36.600
I want to quickly thank, because she's sitting behind me, and she's here to save me if you

54:36.680 --> 54:41.960
ask really detailed questions, Marissa Clark on my team, who did the work of coordinating

54:41.960 --> 54:46.840
with all of our partners, working with you, and working with our board to get this plan

54:46.840 --> 54:52.600
to its current state, and I do think it's quite a good read, if I do say so.

54:53.720 --> 54:55.400
I think it's, how many pages is it?

54:55.400 --> 54:56.200
204.

54:57.720 --> 54:58.760
204?

54:58.760 --> 54:59.720
Oh, that's far too long.

55:00.440 --> 55:01.480
Read the executive summary.

55:02.120 --> 55:06.200
The plan is not an operations manual.

55:07.080 --> 55:08.760
It is more of a guide.

55:09.960 --> 55:14.760
It's about where we want to be as a state in creating a California for all, as the

55:14.760 --> 55:15.400
governor says.

55:16.840 --> 55:21.800
Again, it's about visions and strategies, and less about how you get there.

55:21.800 --> 55:25.160
So it's about where we want to be, and not really about how we get there.

55:25.160 --> 55:26.680
California is very diverse.

55:26.680 --> 55:27.880
The regions are very diverse.

55:28.600 --> 55:34.040
And we need to maximize flexibility and creativity around the state, because there are

55:34.040 --> 55:37.960
many ways to get to the promised land, which is a shared prosperity in the state, again,

55:37.960 --> 55:38.920
in California for all.

55:40.600 --> 55:47.000
A little bit on the why, that you'll read somewhat in the state strategic plan, but

55:47.000 --> 55:53.160
also wanted to go through a very quick history of the workforce development, the federal

55:53.240 --> 55:58.440
workforce development program, Congress's commitment to job training, and then onto

55:58.440 --> 55:59.080
the state plan.

55:59.080 --> 56:00.600
And I promise this won't take long.

56:01.320 --> 56:02.600
I hope it won't take long.

56:02.600 --> 56:04.440
I hope it seems like it was really quick.

56:06.040 --> 56:07.160
So the why.

56:07.160 --> 56:09.720
As you know, California produces enormous wealth.

56:10.280 --> 56:12.680
We have a $3 trillion economy.

56:12.680 --> 56:17.720
We're at full employment for all intents and purposes, 4% across the state.

56:17.720 --> 56:18.920
In some places, it's lower.

56:19.720 --> 56:24.680
But we still have double-digit unemployment in the inland part of the state.

56:25.400 --> 56:29.800
We have high unemployment, as you know, for communities of color.

56:30.680 --> 56:37.880
Even in the coastal regions where unemployment is dipping below 3%, we have double-digit

56:37.880 --> 56:41.640
unemployment for communities that have been locked out of prosperity for generations.

56:42.440 --> 56:45.720
We have the highest levels of poverty in the United States.

56:46.360 --> 56:51.080
In California, obviously, a challenge, a crisis around homelessness and addressing

56:51.080 --> 56:54.360
homelessness, and we have a disconnected youth problem.

56:55.160 --> 57:03.720
That means students, people, youth who are neither in work nor in school, and we are

57:03.720 --> 57:07.080
losing track of them in many ways, and we need to be sure to bring them back into the

57:07.080 --> 57:11.080
mainstream of our educational system and or into work.

57:11.080 --> 57:16.360
Most poor people in California work, oftentimes full-time.

57:16.360 --> 57:18.120
Some people work more than one job.

57:18.120 --> 57:19.160
They're over-employed.

57:21.800 --> 57:32.680
35% of Californians make $15 or less an hour, and 21% of those have an associate's degree

57:32.680 --> 57:33.880
or a bachelor's degree.

57:34.120 --> 57:37.560
We need to, for all of these reasons and others, we need to maximize our investments.

57:38.680 --> 57:45.560
California invests $6 billion a year across all of its education, training, and employment

57:45.560 --> 57:50.600
services components, federal and state dollars, $6 billion a year, but as I said, it's a

57:50.600 --> 57:53.560
patchwork rather than an integrated system.

57:54.600 --> 58:00.440
It's difficult, again, to navigate for people who might not be able to do that, but it's

58:00.760 --> 58:05.480
difficult, again, to navigate for people who most need good jobs.

58:06.120 --> 58:07.480
I don't think it's too much money.

58:07.480 --> 58:13.960
$6 billion sounds like a lot, but for California, the size of the state, a $3 trillion economy,

58:13.960 --> 58:20.680
if we just took 1% of the state's product, annual product, we wouldn't be investing $6

58:20.680 --> 58:21.480
billion a year.

58:21.480 --> 58:23.800
We'd be investing $30 billion a year.

58:24.440 --> 58:29.880
That would probably be a scale that would meet the need of the challenges, but also

58:29.880 --> 58:36.520
the needs of businesses who are saying that workforce development is their number one

58:36.520 --> 58:40.040
challenge in doing business in the state of California.

58:40.040 --> 58:43.320
Not the cost of doing business, not the cost of housing, not taxes.

58:43.960 --> 58:46.040
Workforce is the number one challenge.

58:48.600 --> 58:54.360
Really quickly on the history, because I think it's interesting, and I hope you do, too.

58:55.320 --> 59:01.480
We have a workforce development program that has its roots in the New Deal.

59:02.920 --> 59:08.760
Its focus has largely been throughout that history on skills training for people who

59:08.760 --> 59:15.320
are locked out of prosperity, who are poor, who most need skills to be competitive and succeed.

59:15.960 --> 59:21.240
There was a significant departure in that in 1998 with the Workforce Investment Act.

59:21.240 --> 59:27.800
That was a time of welfare reform and work first, where we de-emphasize training services

59:28.520 --> 59:31.400
and instead emphasize quick attachment to labor markets.

59:33.880 --> 59:40.920
I know it had a huge effect on the effectiveness of the workforce system in terms of outcomes

59:40.920 --> 59:43.080
for people who most need good jobs.

59:43.960 --> 59:52.120
I'll start with Lyndon Johnson, because in 1935 he was appointed by FDR to run the precursor

59:52.120 --> 59:55.480
to youth programs in the Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act.

59:56.280 --> 01:00:02.520
Two years before he was elected to the House, he ran in Texas a youth job training program,

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.520
which is part of the WPA program.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.400
It really has its roots in the New Deal.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:12.840
In 1962, we have the Manpower Demonstration Training Act, signed by John F. Kennedy.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:20.200
It was created initially to retrain workers displaced by technology.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:24.680
In case you thought this conversation about future work is new, it's not.

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:29.880
It's actually a consistent theme throughout the workforce development programs, starting in 1962.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:35.800
It was formula-based funding, based on population poverty.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:41.080
Focus, again, was on training, and the dollars went not through states, but directly to communities

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.640
to provide services to people who most needed services.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:49.880
That unique relationship between the federal government and Congress and local communities

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:53.880
has actually stayed consistent throughout all of the iterations of the law.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:01:00.280
In 1973, the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, CEDA, was signed by President Nixon,

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.840
set up even more local control.

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:09.640
It established what we call prime sponsors, which were cities, counties, and consortium of government,

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.800
so that it's not just community organizations that are getting dollars directly,

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.520
but it's going through cities and counties and consortium of government.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:22.200
It created a thing called private industry councils that were made up of business, labor,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.200
and government to make local policy about how those dollars are invested,

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:29.640
to be sure that we were aligned with what businesses need,

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:33.240
but also aligned with other components of the workforce system.

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:33.960
Sounds familiar?

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:37.640
It added this thing called public service employment.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:44.680
60% of all of the dollars were invested in giving people who had challenges around employment

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:45.800
public sector jobs.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.040
Really fascinating component of the system that lasted quite a while,

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.720
but in the next iteration of the law in 1982, it was knocked out,

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.160
probably because that was President Reagan.

01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:00.280
It was President who signed the Job Training Partnership Act.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:07.080
It further solidified the local service areas through counties, cities, and consortia.

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:14.840
It still formula allocated money to the locals, but now it's going through states,

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.160
so it brings the state in as a partner.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.920
The states are then formula allocating dollars to these local, what we call, service delivery areas.

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:28.360
No more PSE, but public sector employment, but the training, investment, or commitment

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:33.400
is at 70%, so 70% of all of the local dollars had to be spent on training services.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:36.920
1998 Workforce Investment Act, signed by Clinton, as I said,

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:39.400
time of welfare reform, work first.

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.120
Fast placement is a priority.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.400
It's a full employment economy.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.120
It established the one-stop career center system that we've pioneered here in California

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.280
under the previous iteration of the law.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:57.960
It created mandatory partners, so all of the different components of the workforce system

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:01.720
are required to partner together and plan together and produce a plan that we sent

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.240
up to the U.S. Department of Labor.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.880
Universal access is part of the system.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:08.600
It's new.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:11.960
It's actually central to the system, and you've got a sequence of services

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:17.240
that makes training the last level of service.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.960
Training investments plummet.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:25.080
In California, we went from 50% investment in training services and skills

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:30.120
to 10% in some areas of the state, zero, in training services.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:36.120
The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act re-emphasizes training.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:38.520
It re-emphasizes skills.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:43.320
It focuses on industry sectors so that skills are aligned with what companies and businesses

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.360
need by sector.

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:49.880
It emphasizes regionalism for the first time, so not just political jurisdictions,

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:55.880
but how industry sectors organize in a state, and also local and regional planning

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:56.600
for the first time.

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:04.520
WIOA is pretty awesome, but it's not perfect.

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:07.640
It doesn't require the training mandate.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:11.240
There's no specified percentage of the dollars that should be invested in training,

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:17.320
even though the new law is re-emphasizing training services and skills.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:23.880
We still have the Workforce Investment Act in everybody's mind.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:27.560
Actually, some people, it's probably still CETA or even the New Deal.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:35.240
We're making a transition that's a long-term transition to a focus on skills in sectors

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:35.800
and regions.

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:40.840
The new state strategic plan really doubles down on those elements.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:42.120
The plan.

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:49.640
I'm so glad I did that right.

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:56.040
I'll skip ahead.

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:02.680
The core programs of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, still walking through

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.160
a little bit of the structure of the system.

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.760
Forgive me if you already know this.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:08.600
Forgive me if you already know this.

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:13.480
There are four titles in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act that represent

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.000
about six programs.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.800
WIOA Title 1 is what the State Workforce Board has direct policy authority over.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:24.600
Those are the dollars that are formula allocated down to 45 local workforce development

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:25.560
boards around the state.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:32.520
Each board is similar to the state's board, 51% business, organized labor by state statute

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.560
that do policies on behalf of the system.

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:41.000
They oversee roughly 200 one-stop career centers around the state.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.240
We call them AJCs, American Job Centers of California, AJCCs in the state.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.480
The money is administered by the Employment Development Department.

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:50.440
We do the policy.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:55.640
WIOA Title 2, Adult Education and Literacy Activities.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.560
WIOA Title 1, by the way, is about $400 million a year.

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.960
WIOA Title 2 is around $100 million a year.

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:05.320
That's administered through the Department of Education.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:14.760
As you know, the policy set by y'all, the education services are aligned to assist adults

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:19.400
with basic skills, completion of post-secondary education, secondary education rather, and then

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.160
transitioning to post-secondary education.

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:24.360
Title 3 is called Employment Services.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.320
It's about $76 million a year.

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:32.920
It's administered through the Employment Development Department, through AJCCs,

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:42.600
which assist people with identifying opportunities for jobs, looking at job lists,

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.520
and doing labor exchange, for the most part.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:52.680
Title 4, Vocational Rehabilitation Activities, about $313 million a year, administered by the

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:58.360
Department of Rehabilitation, and it's employment-related vocational rehabilitation for

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.120
individuals with disabilities.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:01.880
Those are the four components of the system.

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:07.320
As I said, six programs, because in the WIOA Title 1, it's three separate funding streams,

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:10.680
adult, dislocated worker, and youth services.

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:20.600
As I said, the draft plan, I think I said this, is going to be submitted to the U.S.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.760
Department of Labor at the end of this month.

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:27.560
It outlines a four-year strategy for the state of California.

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.840
The plans are four-year plans.

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:34.360
We've been working with all of the core programs that I talked about in the previous slide,

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:42.600
among other partners, including Corrections, Social Services, a vast array of programs

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:48.200
that are invested through the state of California and locally are represented in our planning

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:48.840
process.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:52.920
The state workforce development plan is not just about the workforce development boards,

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:56.840
it's really about the broad system and a vision for the broad system.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:05.560
Just one point about Perkins, and we'll talk about WIOA Title 2 a little bit later.

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:09.640
My colleague, Carolyn Zachary, will come up and talk about that in a bit.

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.320
With regards to Perkins, because we're not going to do a whole presentation on it,

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:23.240
we have held working forums with all of the partners to discuss ways of aligning and jointly

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:26.840
implementing the state strategic plan and all of our funding streams.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:31.640
But as the joint administrators of Perkins, the chancellor's office, the Department of Education,

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:37.880
and the State Board of Education met with us a number of times on better alignment of the

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:41.080
Perkins program with the rest of the workforce development system.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:47.960
The draft 2020-23 state plan that we're talking about includes a couple of goals related to

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:48.360
Perkins.

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:55.800
One is we continue working together through formal committees to continue to improve

01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:01.000
coordination of CTE programs and the Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act Title 1.

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:06.120
We will work together to utilize the comprehensive local needs assessment criteria

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:12.600
under the Perkins 5 as a tool for encouraging greater alignment of the local eligible agency

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:16.680
or institution with their local and regional workforce systems.

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:21.240
I read that because if you ask me questions, you'll know I don't know the answer to them

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:26.360
probably, but Marissa Clark is going to jump up here and save me if you ask Perkins questions.

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:28.520
Yeah, she's good.

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:38.040
Very quickly, state plan vision, and then I want to walk through strategies, and

01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:41.640
well, strategies, and I'll wrap that up quickly.

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:46.440
But I want to spend a couple of extra minutes on the vision because it's important

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:51.640
and it's new to this year's or this four-year unified strategic plan.

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:56.680
And it's about high road and taking the high road, and this is language that the governor

01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:01.560
is using quite a bit and the secretary of labor is using a lot.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.960
In fact, she's talked about doubling down on the high road, and it's four basic things.

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:08.760
It's number one, quality jobs.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:13.480
So we start with the best jobs, and this is really turning the workforce system sort

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:17.560
of upside down in a way because the workforce system tends to start with programs,

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:24.600
give people what we think is the wherewithal to be successful in competitive labor markets.

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.560
We send people out in those markets and we hope that they connect to a job.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.280
Obama called that train and pray.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.600
Instead of that, starting with programs and pushing people into labor markets,

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:39.240
our intent is to work in industry sectors that are driving regional employment

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:42.760
with companies in those sectors who do right by workers, who treat workers

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:49.560
not as a cost to be reduced, but as an investment, as an asset to invest in.

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:54.360
So in this partnership with companies in those sectors that are driving employment,

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:57.640
we can create pathways into good quality jobs.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:01.800
And instead of pushing people into labor markets, we pull people into jobs.

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:03.080
That's the quality job piece.

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:10.920
Worker voice is the second one in the design and the implementation of workforce programs.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:17.000
We understand that if you're doing deep sector dives with companies and you're looking at

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.680
challenges and opportunities around workforce for a company or a group of companies,

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:23.960
you need workers at the table because they understand best.

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.840
About what happens on the shop floor, so to speak.

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:30.360
They understand how to create efficiencies.

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.760
They understand job flow, workflow.

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:35.880
And if they're not at the table, you're not going to get the best product.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:37.480
You're not going to get the best program.

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:40.840
You're not going to get the best implementation because when workers are at the table,

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:41.560
you get buy-in.

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.360
It's also important for the future of work.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:51.000
It's an anxiety reducing exercise to have workers give them more agency

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.280
in what their future looks like.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:55.000
The third piece is equity.

01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:00.760
The workforce development system generally does very well on the equity side.

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:05.560
If that means removing barriers to employment for populations that have significant barriers

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:08.280
to employment, we do that well.

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.160
But you don't have equity if you don't have job quality.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.320
It makes no sense.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:17.080
I think it does no good to help somebody who's underemployed,

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:21.480
unemployed, or has a crappy job, which is a technical term.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.440
To put that person in another dead-end, low-wage, low-quality job.

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.240
So the job quality and the equity go hand in hand.

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.880
And then finally, climate.

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:38.040
As you know, California is leading the nation, possibly the world,

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:42.440
in mitigating climate change, pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.520
That affects industry.

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:45.960
It affects industry sectors.

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:47.960
It also affects workers.

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:52.920
So our investments in workforce development includes a focus on those sectors

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:57.320
and those communities and those workers who are most impacted by climate change

01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:58.520
and climate change policy.

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.600
Sorry, I didn't keep up with my PowerPoint slides.

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.600
I just got a couple of more.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:14.520
We have three state plan policy objectives that you'll read about in the plan.

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.480
We think these are important.

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:19.160
So we've got the vision, but we've got a lot about the how also,

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.200
and the how are the state plan policy objectives, those three,

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.800
and then state plan strategies.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.320
The first of the three state plan policy objectives

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.720
is fostering demand-driven skills attainment.

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:35.560
As I said, reinvesting in skills training using the Title I dollars,

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:39.960
but also partnering with our schools that are doing effective

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:45.960
career technical education investments, and that partnering is crucial.

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:52.440
Aligning workforce programs, though, with industry needs is the key part there.

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:54.280
So again, we're not pushing people in the labor markets.

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:56.600
We're pulling people into good jobs.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.400
Enabling upward mobility for all Californians,

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:03.080
making sure that programs are accessible, navigable,

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:08.280
so we're aligned so workers can find their way through what is now a patchwork system.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.840
And then aligning, coordinating, and integrating programs and services

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:14.760
to achieve that scale and impact I talked about.

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:18.280
State plan strategies, we have seven.

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:20.440
You can see them here.

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:23.320
Some of them, I think, are self-explanatory.

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:23.960
I've talked about them.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.920
Sector strategies, again, deep sector work.

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:34.600
That doesn't mean inviting employers to your office or to an event

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:39.240
to give you a couple of hours of input on what they think their needs are.

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:44.600
It's sitting down with employers in sectors that are driving employment

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:48.520
and building partnerships that are long-term and understanding their needs with them

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:53.240
both internally so you can move workers up through incumbent worker training

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:59.480
and you create opportunities for getting into new jobs at the front end

01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:03.000
so you get an upskill, backfill thing going.

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:09.240
Career pathways, aligning the system so that, not pathways the way you maybe think about them,

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:13.800
but pathways in the sense that we have a navigable workforce system

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:17.080
that job seekers aren't starting over every time they go to a new program,

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:22.200
but instead the alignment is such that a worker is finding his or her way through it

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.280
on her way to a really good job, not really knowing

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.720
that there are different funding streams and silos.

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:31.000
That's the intent.

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:37.400
Regional partnerships, a new push in the federal law,

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:41.880
but it's been a push of ours previous to the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:48.120
The point is that industry sectors don't align within political jurisdictions.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:53.880
We have to be organized regionally because industry sectors are organized regionally.

01:15:53.880 --> 01:16:00.840
The way companies recruit workers is regional and commute patterns are regional.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.120
We can't be focused on trying to figure out

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:08.040
how to get sector work within narrow political jurisdictions.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.560
Earn and learn, utilizing work-based learning,

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:15.960
paid internships and formalized apprenticeship, and then supportive services.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:23.480
The workforce or the workers that we're most focused on making an impact on or with

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.960
have significant barriers to employment

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:30.600
and don't have the wherewithal to sit in a long-term training program

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:33.800
that is probably going to be necessary for their success.

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:39.560
Wrap-around services are crucial for transportation, child care,

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:43.880
stipends so people can earn while they learn.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:49.320
Apprenticeship is one of those models that work very well, as you probably know.

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:53.480
Cross-system data capacity.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:17:00.040
It's really hard to align a system that is so siloed but also working with its own data.

01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:04.680
So if we can work on the front end on data alignment,

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:07.320
we can create that navigability in a real way.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.920
It's also important on the back end so we can better understand

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:14.280
which interventions are having the best impact on workers.

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:17.800
And then finally, integrated service delivery.

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:22.120
That's it.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.960
Just a few dates.

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:27.240
I've already talked about these, so I don't need to go over them again.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:34.840
Then I want to hand it off to my colleague Carolyn Zachary to talk about WIOA Title II,

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:42.280
but I also want to offer any questions that Marissa can answer.

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:50.680
Terrific. Thank you.

01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:12.680
Perfect. Thank you for putting those together.

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:17.080
All right. Good morning, President Darling-Hammond, board members.

01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:22.040
I am Dr. Carolyn Zachary, the administrator for the Adult Education Office

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:24.120
in the Career and College Transition Division.

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:31.160
The roots of adult education are strong and deep here in California.

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:38.200
Beginning in 1856 in San Francisco with the Board of Education establishing evening classes

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:45.720
for adults in academic subjects and vocational subjects, specifically drafting and bookkeeping.

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:51.800
And those subjects were taught to individuals who were mostly immigrants from Italy, Ireland,

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:57.640
and China. And then in 1870, they had almost a thousand students enrolled,

01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:03.080
and adult education became a permanent fixture in the San Francisco Unified School District.

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:10.760
In 1910, adult education became part of a free public education in California.

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:18.200
And federal support began for adult education, as Tim talked about, in 1964 with the Economic

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:23.160
Opportunity Act, and continues now with the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:29.080
And today, we have over 400 agencies providing adult education services.

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:36.520
Our history is so rich and treasured that Stanford University has established an archive

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:41.800
for adult education, and it continues to maintain that with our annual reports every year.

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:48.440
The archive includes a book published in 2005 called Meeting the Challenge,

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:54.600
a History of Adult Education, and Chad has copies to pass out to all of you later.

01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:03.560
Or you have them, oh good, you have them, perfect. So let's first look at how the opportunities of

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:09.800
the California Department of Education has to connect with our state agency partners

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:17.480
in WIOA titles one, three, and four. We'll talk more specifically about two a little later.

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:24.680
As Tim Rainey shared, the WIOA state plan covers the four title areas identified in the act.

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:30.200
Many program offices within the California Department of Education have connections with

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:38.440
services and support that assist WIOA target populations, including individuals with barriers

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:45.160
to employment, as well as veterans, unemployed workers, incarcerated individuals, immigrants,

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:52.920
the homeless, and youth. Our education options office in the current college transition division

01:20:53.480 --> 01:21:00.280
connects local education agencies with title one youth programs, and our special education

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:06.680
division works specifically with title four in the area of transition students through the

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:15.080
workability title one program. The CDE is the designated state agency for WIOA title two

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:21.480
adult education and family literacy act. As a recipient of the funding, the CDE adult education

01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:27.400
office is responsible for awarding the funds and grant compliance monitoring through the federal

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:35.000
program monitoring system. This includes all sub-grantees, K-12 adult schools, community and

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.840
faith-based organizations, community college non-credit programs, correctional institutions,

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:47.400
and library literacy programs. The WIOA funding is one of two funding streams which supports the

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:53.160
adult education system in California. The state funding stream, the California adult education

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:59.480
program, is the main source of funding for adult programs, and that is jointly administered

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:05.960
between the California adult education, between the California department of education and the

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:13.160
community college chancellor's office. The adult education agencies across the state offer programs

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:18.680
in all of these areas that you see listed here. I want to specifically draw your attention to

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:25.240
something that was new in WIOA, and that is the integrated English language civics education

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:32.040
known as IELCE, just because we need more acronyms in education, and IET which is integrated

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:37.720
education and training, and many of those adult schools that are doing integrated education and

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:43.080
training programs are partnering with career technical education programs and eligible training

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:49.800
providers to deliver training components for that IET, and these training programs do include those

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:57.400
high road areas that Tim referred to earlier. In the adult education system, you can find programs

01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:04.920
and classes in a variety of locations as stated on the slide, and as I talked about earlier,

01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:09.960
the adult education system is supported by those two funding streams, the state funds and the

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:15.560
federal funds. CAPE, which is the California adult education program, the state dollars

01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:22.760
are in the amount of approximately $550 million, and these are allocated to K-12 adult schools

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:29.160
and community colleges within 71 consortia in the state following the community college

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:36.280
district boundaries. The CAPE, as I said earlier, is jointly administered between the chancellor's

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:46.120
office and the CDE, and 88% of those funds go to K-12 adult schools. The other funding source

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:51.320
is the federal WIOA Title II Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, which is part of the

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:58.120
WIOA plan for which we are seeking approval today. These funds of $103 million are considered

01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:06.920
supplemental to the state funds, and the CDE funds these through a competitive grant process

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:18.840
on a three-year basis. In California, we serve over 800,000 students in our adult education program.

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:27.480
That's in addition to the 6.2 million that we often hear quoted, so we're really serving

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:34.520
almost 700 or 7 million students in California, and the only requirement is that you be 18 years

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:42.360
of age to be in these programs. So as you heard earlier from Tim Rainey, WIOA Title II AFLA

01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:47.720
is part of the larger WIOA state plan. The plan guides the services to assist individuals in

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:55.720
our state to move forward. Our adult education system in existence for nearly 165 years is still

01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:04.920
focused on assisting students to improve their skills to have better jobs and improved lives

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:10.680
and better opportunities. The CDE requests your approval on the WIOA state plan. Thank you, and

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:15.640
now I know that we'll be happy to answer any questions. Okay, we could take if there are any

01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:21.800
clarifying questions, but then we'll have public comment and come back for additional deep dive.

01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:30.040
And Ting Sun, would you like to add some comments as our liaison? Yes, so just a couple things.

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:34.280
First of all, thank you, Tim, and thank you for coming and presenting, and Tim is just as

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:43.240
fascinating the second time around. So this is an application process that, as Tim said,

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:48.920
requires the partnership of the Department of Education and the State Board of Education.

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:56.840
It is not one that we necessarily lead, and so it doesn't come up to us very often, but, you know,

01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:05.560
it is a very important part of our work. And so I think mainly just kind of understanding that

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:13.000
this is a much, much broader application process. We're one piece of it, and that we also, through

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.800
the Perkins application that you'll be hearing about a little bit later, and through the work

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:23.800
of the California Joint Workforce Pathways Advisory Committee, we are also liaisoning

01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:32.040
as well with this larger WIOA application. Thank you. Are there any just quick clarifying

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:37.640
questions that we need to ask to understand the data that's been presented? All right,

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:45.240
let's see if there's any public comment. We have three people signed up for public comment,

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:50.520
Branka Marcetta, Jennifer Barrett, and Karen Malkiewicz.

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:56.680
Okay, we encourage you to state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:05.800
Hello, esteemed State Board members and State Board staff. Thank you for allowing

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:10.440
you to take this public comment today. My name is Branka Marcetta, and I currently

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:14.280
facilitate and direct the work of the Adult Education Consortium here in the Greater

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:19.400
Sacramento region, one of the 71 that Dr. Zachary mentioned earlier. And previously,

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:24.840
for over a decade, I served the field of adult education for the whole state and nationally

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:30.920
within the space of the Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act. I also speak on behalf of a

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:37.800
professional association whose 3,000 plus members are educators, support staff, learners, and friends

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:43.480
of adult education. More of my fellow educators would be here today if they were not a few blocks

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:48.920
away participating in activities with our workforce development partners. I'm here to express

01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:54.760
my support for the WIO estate plan. I would like to thank the California Workforce Development Board

01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:59.800
and California Department of Education for their work in the planning and development of this plan

01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:06.440
with particular recognition of Mrs. Carolyn Zachary or Dr. Zachary. Ms. Zachary and her team

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:11.960
at the Adult Education Office are well structured in their position to support the implementation

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:16.840
of the plan. I invite you to visit with our local programs that are co-located

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:22.440
with adult education programs and job centers. Please visit with us in Sacramento area to see

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:37.080
this in action. Thank you very much. Good morning, Madam President and the esteemed members of the

01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:42.120
California State Board of Education. I'm here this morning to provide my support of the new

01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:48.680
WIO estate plan and to recognize the CDE Office of Adult Education staff for their tireless work

01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:54.440
in its development. My name is Karen Malkowitz and I'm a K-12 adult education principal in Sacramento

01:28:54.440 --> 01:29:01.560
County. I oversee programs funded by WIOA Title II, including programs in correctional settings.

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:07.320
We owe a Title I serving adults, out-of-school youth and refugees, and CTE programs funded

01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:13.080
through Carl Perkins. The strategies in the plan designed to serve and support California's

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:18.760
disenfranchised adults and older youth were established as a result of extensive research,

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:25.400
collaboration, and stakeholder input. As educators, we know that a parent's ability to obtain

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:31.240
and retain a family-sustaining career can have a direct impact on a child's success in life.

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:36.040
For the sake of our state's future, please approve this plan and I thank you for your time.

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:52.440
Good morning, Madam President, members of the California State Board of Education,

01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:57.960
and Executive Director Karen Staff Walters. My name is Jennifer Barrett and I would like to

01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:03.160
express my support for the WIOA state plan. I have worked in the field of adult education

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:08.760
for the past 30 years as a teacher and now as an administrator, serving the communities of South

01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:14.520
Sacramento and Elk Grove. I manage a job center and the correctional education programs housed

01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:21.800
in the Sacramento County jails. The job center is co-located within a K-12 adult education facility

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:27.640
and WIOA services help our communities navigate school and work issues with the goal of developing

01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:34.920
family-sustaining pathways. Having both DOR and DHA as on-site partners is immeasurably

01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:40.360
helpful to those with disabilities and serves as a touch point for families who receive state

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:45.960
financial assistance. I've been around long enough to remember the divide between education

01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:52.440
and employment services. The state plan sets a great path toward WIOA 1 through 4 collaboration

01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:58.440
needing to support our at-risk populations by providing necessary structure and cross agency

01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:06.440
times. Thank you. All right, open the conversation to the board for any discussion.

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:16.680
Member Navo, Member Burr, oh you're pointing, oh Member Rucker, okay. You know I was just had a

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:23.560
question for, oh Patricia first? No, no. Okay, sorry. Go ahead. For Tim, first of all I really

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:29.960
appreciate this and I think deeply about the migrant communities in the Central Valley

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:37.080
that greatly struggle and need as much support as possible and I'm interested in the wraparound

01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:44.120
services that you highlighted where there's geographic spread and transportation barriers

01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:50.440
and where, can you highlight maybe a couple places where this is working or these wraparound

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:58.200
services are really improving the opportunities for those in situations like I'm describing?

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:06.200
That's a great question. The workforce development boards who oversee the career centers, the AJCs,

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:11.400
they're all, like I said, there are 200 of them across the state. Through those AJCs,

01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:18.440
supportive services are provided to workers, job seekers who need those supportive services

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:23.640
and they're not as generous as we'd like them to be. There just isn't enough money in the system

01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:34.280
I think to support the level of need. We had a program last year that we're still administering

01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:41.240
AB 1111 which provided 15 million dollars for additional supportive services but the unique

01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:47.400
thing in 1111 was it created a partnership and alignment between workforce development boards

01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:53.000
and community-based organizations across the state because CBOs are on the front lines.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.800
The mission-driven CBOs are on the front lines. They know best how to serve populations with

01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:05.560
barriers. They know best what kinds of wraparound services are necessary and we need to bring them

01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:09.560
more into the mainstream of the workforce development system. They often have their own

01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:13.960
resources but they're also under-resourced so that collaboration between the CBOs and the

01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:19.960
workforce development boards is really crucial not only to get a scale for impact of the resources

01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:24.760
but also to reach the communities in the most effective way. So we're going to continue to work

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:29.640
on trying to ensure that we have adequate funding for the supportive services part because the job

01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:36.440
training doesn't work if people can't be in the job training because they've got issues around

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:39.240
child care, transportation, or if they need a paycheck.

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:47.400
Member Rucker? Well, Tim, I want to first of all thank you for bringing this plan before the board

01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:53.480
and I was looking forward to your presentation today and I did read the plan and I thought

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:59.080
it was really compelling reading actually because I was fascinated by several things.

01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:05.640
First of all, given California's place in the world and in the economy, I think it's really

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:11.400
important for a state like ours to make a definitive policy and an definitive assertion

01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:17.080
about establishing a high-road workforce system. I think that was very important and I thought it

01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:24.360
was very thoughtfully developed and crafted and explained in the plan. Secondly, I was absolutely

01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:31.560
appreciative that you did not in the plan treat California's workforce like a monolith.

01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:37.960
I appreciated the level of granularity that you looked at regional needs but also regional

01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:44.040
differences about what defines the workforce, where the gaps are, and where the growth opportunities

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:49.640
actually exist. When I travel out of state and I visit friends and family, as I did recently,

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:57.160
people still look at California and think about the Silicon Valley or agriculture, but not all

01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:04.040
of the other types of work that defines our workforce. But finally, and I really want to

01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:11.240
thank you for the statement you made about the dignity of work and its importance to the people

01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:18.200
who are in our workforce. Because accepting and understanding that, many people not only define

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:24.200
themselves by that work, but they are defined by others, by the dignity of the work that they do.

01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:31.560
So I truly appreciate the vision the plan articulated, but also the very artful and forceful

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:40.520
way you created—and notice how I used the royal we—you created a plan that will create a different

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:45.160
line in the sand and a different direction for the state. So thank you very much for that.

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:55.480
Any other board comments or discussion? Okay. All right. Do I have a motion?

01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:01.160
I will move the department's recommendation to approve the plan.

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:02.360
And I will second it.

01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:04.200
All right. All those in favor say aye.

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:10.120
Any opposed nay. Any abstentions? Motion carries. Thank you very much. We appreciate it.

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:19.960
Right along to item three, which is the Career Technical Education Incentive Grant.

01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:27.400
There is an addendum for attachment one. There are, I believe, two recusals for this item.

01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:37.960
Members Ortiz-Lacon and Ting Sun. So we'll let you leave the room.

01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:50.920
Okay. And the CDE recommends that the State Board review and approve the following

01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:59.000
information. There is a proposed allocation formula for the Career Technical Education

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:04.600
Incentive Grant and specific proposed funding amounts and the number of grant awards, which

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:11.000
is an attachment two. So you have two attachments there. The purposes for which grant funds may be

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:17.800
used, which includes the minimum eligibility standards, allowable and non-allowable expenditures.

01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:25.560
And this item will be presented by Pradeep Khurram Raju from the CDE. Pradeep, please begin.

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:30.040
Oh, hi. Good morning.

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:34.200
I will be presented by Kai Jackson and Pradeep. Thank you, ma'am. I appreciate it. Good morning,

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:42.440
President Darling-Hammond, State Board members and staff. And as the President noted, I will be

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:48.200
assisted in this presentation by Dr. Kodam Raju, Director of the Career and College Transition

01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:54.200
Division. Russ Weichel is in the audience, who is a retired annuitant, provide technical assistant,

01:37:54.200 --> 01:38:00.760
and the unit manager for the CTE unit will provide technical assistance. And indeed,

01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:08.920
this is a good day to talk about workability and Career Technical Education and its various modalities

01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:17.480
and grant variations. And so we'll talk a little bit about CTE IG. But before I do that,

01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:26.440
this issue was really reinforced to me yesterday when I met with between 40 to 50 students

01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:35.080
from various school districts within Orange County. And of the many things they talked to me about,

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:43.320
school funding, mental health, CTE was one of them. And they reinforced not only the desire to have

01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:49.000
more career pathways at their schools and within their districts, but the desire to be ready and

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:56.120
prepared for the jobs of today, tomorrow, and beyond. And so as we've seen in our state over

01:38:56.120 --> 01:39:04.920
the last number of years, CTE has had a number of increased investments, and our state has increased

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:09.320
and bolstered its efforts to prepare our students for the jobs of tomorrow.

01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:18.440
So we saw in 2018-2019 budget year that there was an appropriation for $300 million

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:25.560
ongoing towards CTE. And in that package, roughly half went to the California Community Colleges,

01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:32.200
K-12 Strong Workforce Program, and the other half, approximately $150 million, went to the

01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:41.480
CTE for the CTE Incentive Grant. And as you may recall, this item was postponed from the January

01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:49.080
meeting. There were questions from our customers, from the field, from the LEAs. And today we will

01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:57.080
speak to many of those questions. But since January, we, the state board staff, the CTE staff,

01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:07.160
some members that are here today, have engaged with the field, with our customers, stakeholders,

01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:13.160
and we've heard them loud and clear. We've been engaged with various conversations in various

01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:18.440
conversations and in various modalities, whether via webinars, whether in person,

01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:24.840
whether legislative hearings, with advocates, with LEAs, the legislature, Department of Finance,

01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:31.320
and LAO, and many more. And so today, we will affirm that they've been heard,

01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:39.080
and that we've looked at issues that they've brought to us, to include ensuring that these

01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:47.000
resources can be as predictable and stable to the maximum extent possible, that we provide

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:53.080
transparency in messaging, either potential or actual changes. And we've heard their desire

01:40:53.080 --> 01:41:00.040
to work towards more alignment between these funding streams. And importantly, we've heard

01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:05.240
their desire for us to maintain and bolster an equity lens as we implement these dollars.

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:11.560
And so our team, to include the state board, have worked very, very diligently, incredibly hard

01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:19.240
to address these issues, to ensure that these funds get out where they're intended to be

01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:27.720
accurately and on time. And so I'd like to turn this over to my colleague, Dr. Kotam Raju,

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:31.560
and he'll talk about the CTE Incentive Grant.

01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:42.920
Thank you, Kai. Good morning. I'm Pradeep Kotam Raju. I'm the Director of the Korean College

01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:48.360
Transition Division at the California Department of Education. President Darling-Hammond,

01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:59.000
members of the board, State Superintendent Tony Thurmond, and other colleagues. Just to add one

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:05.000
thing to what Kai was talking about is the K-12 Strong Workforce Program and the CTIC program

01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:11.880
are worked together for student outcomes. We've had several conversations with the

01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:19.960
Chancellor's Office to talk about how we can align the metrics for the two, and we'll talk about that

01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:31.880
in a moment. So the funding allocation is stipulated in code, and the authority is set out

01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:39.080
to develop the allocation formula and is jointly determined by the State Board of Education and the

01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:47.080
California Department of Education. What you have in the blue copy is an attachment that

01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:53.560
describes how the formula has been laid out and how the allocations are set. And in the board

01:42:53.560 --> 01:43:02.920
memo, we provided an attachment for what we call the matrix of metrics. And also in that memo,

01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:08.840
we talked about how the renewal grants are awarded, and I'll address that

01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:22.040
in the presentation. Attachment three is provided as it lays out the statute in detail for the CTIC

01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:30.680
grant. So just to give you an idea of what the matrix of metrics is, I won't read all of that,

01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:38.440
but as you read that for yourselves, you can see a lot of that is familiar with a lot of the

01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:45.160
indicators that we are dealing in other programs as well and within the California Accountability

01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:55.800
Model. And the thing to keep in mind here is what we're trying to do is we have metrics that we

01:43:55.880 --> 01:44:01.240
have to report for CTIC, we have metrics that we have to report for K-12 strong workforce,

01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:06.360
and we have metrics that we have to report for the Carl Perkins grant. We are working together

01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:12.360
within the department and with the Chancellor's Office to try to make sure that we align that

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:19.000
so that when LEAs provide data to either the California Department of Education or to the

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:25.960
Chancellor's Office, they're actually, so we have a single system which we're sort of moving

01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:34.200
towards using CALPADS, so when they submit this data, they don't have to do this three times,

01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:40.520
and it will be within staff within that will then extract that and use the metrics appropriately

01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:42.280
for all of these different programs.

01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:55.720
The other thing I would like to say is that some of these metrics that were laid out in the

01:44:55.720 --> 01:45:05.400
legislation are yet to be collected within the system, like apprenticeships or industry-based

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:11.240
certifications, and we are having conversations within the California Department of Education

01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:19.240
how to include this through, excuse me, within our data system, but particularly how we

01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:25.000
can bring them forward into the CCI or the College and Career Indicator.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:39.640
As Kai mentioned, the item was postponed from the January 2020 meeting, and since that time,

01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:45.480
we have been diligently working to ensure the accuracy of the allocation formula and the

01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:53.160
specific allocations that will now be proposed to the State Board of Education. We held a webinar

01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:59.320
to explain to the field the allocation process. The webinar provided an opportunity to receive

01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:05.720
additional feedback from stakeholders and LEAs and to answer questions from the field.

01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:14.040
It also provided the CDE an opportunity to give additional clarity and transparency

01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:22.840
into the changes. The CDE also participated in a California Assembly legislative hearing

01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:29.160
and were able to answer questions and provide feedback to the Assembly Committee on Education.

01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:37.320
The CDE continues to affirm our commitment to work with stakeholders, the legislature,

01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:42.120
and the Department of Finance, as well as with you, the State Board of Education,

01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:46.680
to ensure the accurate implementation of the CTIC grant.

01:46:52.840 --> 01:47:06.040
For the 2019 and 20 funding for the fiscal year, the CDE proposes using three categories based on

01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:14.040
the legislation. The CTIC funding, a total of $150 million, is allocated per legislation

01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:21.880
in the categories that you see in front of you, and it's based on average daily attendance or ADA.

01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:30.840
Roughly, the small category has $6 million, the medium category has $12 million, and the large

01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:38.760
category has $132 million, and the percentages are prescribed in legislation.

01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:55.560
The other factor that drives the allocations is one is the eligibility of how much an LEA is eligible

01:47:55.560 --> 01:48:01.880
is based on a calculation, which I will explain and which is described in the blue sheet that

01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:11.000
was provided to you. The other criteria is the legislation stipulates that there has to be a

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:19.160
two-to-one match. For every dollar from this grant, there has to be two local dollars to that,

01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:28.760
and that has implications of how eventually each LEA gets allocated funds.

01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:40.520
The application process, just as a clarifying aspect, there are two parts to this,

01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:49.640
or two broad areas. One is we have an application process that LEAs apply either singly or as a

01:48:49.640 --> 01:49:00.520
consortium, and that application, that two-part application as you see on the slide, is that

01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:08.280
we have that inputted into our Grants Management System. The points are signed there. There's a

01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:14.520
self-evaluation, there's a narrative, there's a budget narrative, and a three-year budget,

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:27.720
and how is this application connected to the LCAP, and the maximum is a total of 54 points.

01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:40.680
When the applications are scored, there is a total of, if you score 27 and above, you get put

01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:50.840
into a pool of eligible LEAs for funding. So you're scored, and then the ones that meet the

01:49:52.280 --> 01:50:00.200
application or that criteria, those 27 points, then we set out the allocation process for that,

01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:09.400
and how each LEA will be awarded funds that you would be approving today.

01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:31.640
So the next four slides that we will go through talks about the allocation formula that we've used

01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:43.080
for the 2019-20 allocations. There are three sort of broad areas that we look at in terms of

01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:52.200
calculation. One is we use the ADA, and this is, let me say this, this is done for each of the

01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:58.600
categories. We do that separately for each of the categories, and so there is a 70 percent base grant

01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:06.200
that is based on ADA. So it's the total ADA in that, for example, the small category,

01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:13.800
and the share, the ADA share in that for that particular LEA determines how much of the base

01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:19.640
category, the base funding that they would get. Then there are what are called positive considerations.

01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:26.600
There are eight positive considerations. Seven of them are also using the same technique as we use

01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:33.720
for the base grant we use in terms of the positive considerations. The point to remember about the

01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:39.800
positive considerations is this. You're either in the, you have the positive consideration or

01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:46.360
you do not have the positive consideration, and then basically the allocation is based on those

01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:51.400
that are in that, in that, who make that or meet that positive consideration.

01:51:53.080 --> 01:52:04.920
So when we look at the second, so for seven of them we use the formula that was,

01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:10.920
let me just go back, that we use the formula that 30 percent that's there, the total category,

01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:19.560
and as I said we do that for each of the ADA categories. But we also have an eighth category

01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:27.160
which is called the unduplicated pupil count. In that, we essentially look at, for unduplicated

01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:34.680
pupil count, that positive consideration is we look at the share of that LEA in the unduplicated,

01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:42.200
total unduplicated pupil count, and then essentially multiply that by the per pupil

01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:49.560
unduplicated pupil count dollar amount, and then multiply it by the LEA's unduplicated

01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:55.800
pupil count to get a dollar amount for this positive consideration. So keep in mind,

01:52:55.800 --> 01:53:03.000
we have a base calculation, we have these eight positive considerations for which we have a dollar

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:09.480
allocation, and then we add them together to get the, what we're referring to as the eligible

01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:19.000
allocation amount for a single LEA, and we do that for every of each of the categories,

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:29.320
the small, medium, and large categories. So now once we decide, once we determine the eligible

01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:37.240
amount that an LEA gets, the next thing we look at is the match. What kind of match can they provide

01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:43.560
in the grant? And remember the match is one is to two, that is for every grant dollars there has to

01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:50.520
be two local dollars that are provided. So the LEA receives the lesser of the two, either the

01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:58.360
eligible amount or the match, and in your blue sheet, in the document, we've explained in that

01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:07.960
how, and giving you examples of how that is there in terms of describing how that works. So the

01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:13.960
thing to keep in mind, it's the lesser of the two, either the eligible amount or the match that they get.

01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:22.360
When you add up the eligible amount for a category, let's say the small category, we notice that

01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:31.640
the LEAs in the small category did not expend the six million dollars that was allocated to that

01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:41.960
small category. So there was essentially funds in that we needed to find some way of allocating

01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:48.200
that because keep in mind all of these dollars have to be allocated otherwise they go back to

01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:55.080
the state in terms of that. So we had to find a way of allocating those funds to making sure that at

01:54:55.080 --> 01:55:07.080
least LEAs get awarded all of that amount. So it allows for awarding LEAs in the small categories

01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:13.080
up to their match. So in the small categories, so going to the next slide,

01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:24.200
when we looked at this, basically what happens is that we found that there were some LEAs,

01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:31.320
I'm using the small as an example here, there were some LEAs that could match a lot more than

01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:38.600
what they were eligible for. So the extra funds that were available in that small category then

01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:45.400
was then reallocated first to those in the small category so they ended up getting at least up to

01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:52.840
their match. And so we gave them additional dollars over and about what they were eligible for.

01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:59.560
And as a result of that, even after that there were still some funds left over. So then we

01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:07.160
took those funds and moved them to the medium category. And we did the same allocation process,

01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:14.760
we did exactly the same process and moved that. And there was still, once we allocated to all of

01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:21.480
the medium, there were still funds left over that we moved to the large category. So the thing to,

01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:28.840
first thing to keep in mind that both the small and the medium category received their match,

01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:35.000
what they could match for, so not only what they were eligible for but some additional dollars

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:42.680
up to their match. We never exceeded over the match amount that they had. Some, of course,

01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:47.640
got exactly their match because that's what the allocation turned out to be,

01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:52.760
but there were instances where they got some additional dollars in the small and medium category.

01:56:52.760 --> 01:57:04.520
On the other hand, when we moved the remaining funds to the large ADA category,

01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:14.040
because of their size, the large ADA categories probably had a lot more match

01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:21.560
than what they were eligible for. So in the large ADA categories, there was match left on the table,

01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:28.360
so to speak, and all they received was what they were eligible for. And in that way, we

01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:35.160
ensured that the $150 million was all expended through this process that we applied.

01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:45.800
So as I talked about, the cut score was 27 out of 54 in terms of applications. There were

01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:53.000
50 new grant applications, applicants for this year of funding compared to 44 for the prior year.

01:57:53.560 --> 01:58:04.040
There were 288 renewal grants again awarded from the 2018-19,

01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:08.200
and the LEAs represented 54 of the 58 counties.

01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:15.400
So once we did the calculations that I just described to you, this was the total allocation

01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:23.880
for each of the three categories, and it totals up to $150 million. So we had 20 LEAs in the small

01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:31.800
category, 52 LEAs in the medium category, and 264 LEAs in the large category.

01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:37.240
One of the things the State Board of Education has to do is to also recommend in the recommendation

01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:43.320
these allowable and non-allowable expenditures, and these are described to you in pages five and

01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:50.360
six of the board item. So we tried to encourage and maintain the delivery of high-quality CTE

01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:57.880
and the delivery of high-quality CTE, and the delivery of high-quality CTE, and the delivery of

01:58:57.880 --> 01:59:05.560
maintain the delivery of high-quality CTE, and these allowable and non-allowable expenditures

01:59:05.560 --> 01:59:17.080
are laid out, and the grantees are made aware of them through basically we have technical assistance

01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:23.240
staff within that are assigned within our, and they make sure that they work with the

01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:28.120
with the the grantees to to make sure that they are following these

01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:36.120
this recommendation. So the number of grants recommended to be awarded are 336,

01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:45.160
and basically, and that number hasn't changed very much from last year. Last year there was 337,

01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:52.840
even the number of applicants last year was 379, this year was 378. So it's about the same

01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:59.480
in terms of, and as you saw before, lots of the people that apply tend to be renewal or they

02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:11.800
apply for as renewal grants. So let me come back and talk about the, before we go into the

02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:24.200
recommendation, let me talk about the 2018-19 use of five categories. One of the things that,

02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:32.040
as you recall through my, as I presented, the allocation formula that we used, and they were

02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:40.440
these extra, I'll call them extra funds in each of the categories, and we had to find a methodology

02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:48.280
to expend those funds so that LEAs receive all of the 150 million dollars.

02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:54.440
So what we did was instead of using the three categories, which was in the statute, we ended

02:00:54.440 --> 02:01:01.640
up using five categories where we divided the large category into three categories.

02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:08.520
We called large A, large B, and large C. And what you have in front of you there is essentially

02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:17.160
to look at, given that it's a fixed amount of dollars, there will be some adjustments

02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:23.800
in the dollars that are allocated, and the smaller LEAs gained, when I say the smaller,

02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:29.880
particularly the large A and the large B gained as a result of that, and it worked against the

02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:37.240
smaller LEAs who joined consortia. One of the things to keep in mind that when we compare the

02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:45.800
2019-20 allocations back to the 2017-18 allocations, which was essentially at that time

02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:53.400
that we used the three categories, the dollar amounts allocated to LEAs were more or less the

02:01:53.400 --> 02:02:04.440
same. So in essence, in 2018-19, there was a deviation from the trend, if you want to look

02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:12.760
at that, there was a bump for certain LEAs, or there was a redistribution of the funds based on

02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:20.760
using those five categories. So when you look at, we compared the two just to let you know what

02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:29.000
those extra funds that were left there, and we used the same. So the big difference is

02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:37.080
that the way we calculated the 19-20 was slightly different from the way we calculated the 18-19,

02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:43.160
but eventually we were able to allocate all of the funds to the LEAs.

02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:52.680
So the recommendation that you have in front of you is that the CD recommends that the SBA review

02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:59.880
and approve the following information. Proposed TTIG allocation, which is an allocation formula,

02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:03.960
the specified proposed funding amounts and number of grants awarded,

02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:08.920
the purpose for which grants may be used and minimum eligibility standards,

02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:11.640
and the allowable and non-allowable expenditures.

02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:21.160
Does that end the presentation? Do you want to say something now?

02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:26.200
Thank you, ma'am. I appreciate it. Thank you, Dr. Kodem Raju. I appreciate the data that was

02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:32.520
presented, and just in closing, I just wanted to note something importantly that as California

02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:38.760
continues to bolster preparing kids for the jobs of today and tomorrow, one of the things I'm not

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:45.000
quite sure that we mentioned was that as compared to last year when the requests for these dollars

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:52.840
were right about $300 million, this year the request was up to $900 million, which really

02:03:52.840 --> 02:04:01.000
speaks to the demand for increased CTE funding and pathways in schools. And as we look over the

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:08.040
horizon at the demand signal, I see it increasing even more. And so today we talked about increasing

02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:14.840
our transparency, ensuring the accuracy of the implementation of these dollars, equity,

02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:20.280
and then ensuring that 100% of the funds were going to where they're intended to, to get down

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:26.440
to the school site level. And so in closing, once again, I want to thank all of the members who

02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:31.880
supported this program and this effort and the staff and the state board. And with that, I

02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:39.240
turn it back over to them. So I appreciate the closing comments and also the detail of the

02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:44.520
presentation. And so I know there's a lot of detail in here, and I hope that we'll get a

02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:49.720
chance to, but I'm going to first turn to Member Rucker. She's our liaison to this process and

02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:55.640
ask her for some opening comments. Well, first of all, I need to give my commendations to the staff,

02:04:55.640 --> 02:05:01.720
Dr. Kodemaraju and your unit, as well as the other divisions in the state, including the

02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:08.520
Department of Finance, who worked very closely with us on putting this item together and on

02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:14.280
doing an analysis about the distribution of the funding. And I also want to thank Patricia

02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:19.960
DeCoste. She spent a lot of time with me going through this process and answering my questions,

02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:27.480
so did Kaleem Jackson. He talked to me regularly as late as yesterday to look at this information

02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:32.680
and to understand it. I want to draw attention for my colleagues on the board to page

02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:40.040
two of attachment one. It says the State Board of Education is required to give the greatest

02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:46.120
weight to applicants meeting criteria A, B, and C pursuant to Ed Code section 53075B.

02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:57.960
So as I went through the list and I paid attention with great interest to each of the categories of

02:05:59.240 --> 02:06:06.120
LEAs that are being funded, many people would assume with a grant and a pot this size that

02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:12.920
large LEAs would particularly be favored in receiving the lion's share of the grant.

02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:17.480
And in the work that was done with the funding formulas, particularly looking at

02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:24.280
starting with the smaller districts and moving to the medium and large, there is great diversity

02:06:24.280 --> 02:06:30.760
of who was funded. There's great diversity in the geography of the LEAs that were funded.

02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:35.800
But there's also a great distribution between charter schools and non-charter schools

02:06:35.800 --> 02:06:43.080
who were equally considered and equally weighted given the criteria that Dr. Kodem Raju explained.

02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:49.000
And I'm satisfied that the weight of the recommendations that are being funded for

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:54.840
the LEAs that are being funded definitely do give weight to those applicants for those first three

02:06:54.840 --> 02:07:00.920
criteria. So I can share with you that that is very clear. So when we finish with the discussion,

02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:09.560
I am ready to recommend the recommendations. With one reminder, there was a revised addendum.

02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:13.720
So as it relates to the proposed CTIG allocation formula,

02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:18.440
it's the revised attachment one that I want to make sure you're paying attention to.

02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:23.400
So member, I want to thank you for that and also for the clarification that you shared about

02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:29.240
the diversity and variance in the regions. And I really appreciate that. So at this point,

02:07:29.240 --> 02:07:33.640
we're going to open to board members just for one clarifying comment before we go to public

02:07:33.640 --> 02:07:37.560
comments. I'll just kind of look around and see if there's any clarifying. So Brenna,

02:07:37.560 --> 02:07:42.680
no? Any clarifying? Okay, so we'll go to public comment first and then we'll come back for board

02:07:42.680 --> 02:07:53.800
discussion. There's no public comment. All right. Well, thank you. So now I'll go back to a member

02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:57.080
record. Do you want any further clarifying comments? Because you obviously have a depth

02:07:57.080 --> 02:08:01.480
of knowledge about this and the comprehensive. Is there anything else you want to share

02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:08.680
for the board? Or do you want to start with your motion? I believe I gave the comment. Okay. Great.

02:08:09.560 --> 02:08:13.960
Again, I do want to remind you that there was a revised addendum. Yes. So for your records,

02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:19.240
work away, everything else. And make sure any future questions you receive, pay attention

02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:26.520
to the revised addendum. So with that, will you make a motion? Oh, yes, go ahead. To follow up

02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:31.880
on what member Rucker talked about. The other thing we should keep in mind is that the use of

02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:39.960
the unduplicated people count because in that we use free and reduced lunch English language learners

02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:47.480
and foster children. So that also leads to looking at equity in a much larger scale within this

02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:51.720
allocation formula. Thank you. So member Rucker, will you make your. So I'm going to move the

02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:59.000
staff recommendation as has printed out in the revised addendum on page one of the revised

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:04.840
addendum. Okay. And do I have a second? I'll second. Okay. We have a second member Navo.

02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:15.720
Any other further board comment? So all those in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Any abstentions?

02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:22.360
So the motion carries unanimously. Thank you very much. With that, we're going to take a short break.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.920
So I thank you to the department and everyone who works so hard on this process.

02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:32.920
We're going to take a maybe a short, just short break. Okay. Thank you.

02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:36.680
See you back in five minutes.

02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:43.880
I hate to call people out, but everyone's why you have to do it.

02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:53.400
All right. We're going to continue on so that we can complete this next item before lunchtime.

02:09:57.320 --> 02:09:59.320
This is the item you've all been waiting for.

02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:04.680
Item number four. Agenda item number four.

02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:13.640
Thank you for taking your seats. We're going to continue.

02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:18.280
If you have a conversation that's important, you can take it to the hall.

02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:28.600
Okay. Item four is the federal Perkins state plan item. It does have an addendum.

02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:35.080
The CDE recommends that we approve the draft federal Perkins five state plan and forward

02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:41.320
the plan to the governor's office for a 30-day review. In addition, CDE recommends that the

02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:48.200
state board allow the department in collaboration with SBE staff to make any necessary non-substantive

02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:55.800
clarifying edits. This item will be presented by Pradeep Kotamraju from the CDE. Pradeep, please begin.

02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:09.240
I'm Pradeep Kotamraju from the CDE, and I'd like to present the draft federal Perkins five state

02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:15.800
plan for Korean technical education and recommend that it, subject to your approval, move it forward

02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:23.560
to the governor's office. Before I start into my remarks here, I would like to thank

02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:29.800
I want to thank the State Board staff, Patricia DeCoste and Pam Castleman, who have worked

02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:37.280
with us as partners through this process, as well as staff from the California Community

02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:42.880
Chancellor's Office, Community College Chancellor's Office, and staff at CDE.

02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:48.720
I particularly want to thank those within the data division, the three data divisions

02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:55.520
to help with the accountability section, but consultations with many of the divisions

02:11:55.520 --> 02:12:06.520
within the CDE helped bring it to this draft that is in front of you.

02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:14.320
So the overview that I'll go through, I'll talk about just in terms of the milestones

02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:21.440
in the development of the plan, the approach that we took, the broad overview of the sections,

02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:25.520
and then ask for your recommendation.

02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:31.320
If you recall, when I came and presented to you at the January meeting, we went through

02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:37.080
a rather detailed presentation of each of the different strands in that.

02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:44.080
I will not be doing that, but giving you a high-level approach to what this plan entails.

02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:50.800
And I think it's fitting in terms of having this plan be presented to you in the light

02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:59.800
of the previous two items that we presented today, particularly looking at the WIOA plan,

02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:04.920
because a lot of that, we've been having a lot of conversations with Tim Rainey and

02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:11.920
his staff about how we can collaborate a lot more, not only in terms of the federal grants

02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:18.920
that we have within the state, but also aligning the different state programs that we have

02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:25.920
both on the workforce development side as well as the education side as well.

02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:38.920
So as I mentioned here, we followed the leadership of the California Workforce Pathways Joint

02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:45.920
Advisory Committee. Three of the members are from the state board. We have three other

02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:52.920
members from the Board of Governors as well.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:57.920
When I came here in July, and this was going on before that, we have what we call a joint

02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:04.400
management team from these three agencies that met regularly almost weekly to work through

02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:11.400
various iterations of the draft plan with input from not only the Joint Advisory Committee,

02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:18.920
but also from other stakeholders as well.

02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:24.800
We had a stakeholder and public comment process that we engaged in. We had the stakeholder

02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:31.800
engagement that we looked at, and across, we had the cross-key subgroups. We had a two

02:14:32.800 --> 02:14:39.800
full day meeting and one virtual session in the fall of 2019. We also added additional

02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:46.800
stakeholder meetings to receive the teacher voice in this.

02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:53.800
And all of this was done before, except for the accountability meeting, all of this was

02:14:53.800 --> 02:15:00.800
done prior to actually writing the first draft of the plan so we could get input from the

02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:03.960
field.

02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:10.800
Once we wrote the first draft of the plan and then we put that out for public comment,

02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:16.000
we had a public comment session. There were four in-person sessions and a virtual public

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:23.000
feedback session, and we had an online feedback session for 32 days. We had 361 comments

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:30.000
in 92 number of commenters. The public comment document is actually now available online

02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:40.360
that there is a link in the board item as well as within the plan that we provided a

02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:45.360
link for the public comment item.

02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:50.360
We went through an iterative review with the California Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory

02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:55.960
Committee. In November 2019, we presented the plan and that was reviewed and moved forward

02:15:55.960 --> 02:16:02.960
for public comment. In January of 2020, we had a plan that was revised to include the

02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:13.960
public comment and we detailed out the accountability section in the plan.

02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:21.800
We were asked to come back again in March to present to the Joint Advisory Committee

02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:29.120
and this time we updated the teacher and faculty preparation section and then the plan was

02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:36.120
approved to move forward to you, the State Board of Education.

02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:43.140
With regard to the review of the State Board of Education, there was a December 2019 information

02:16:43.140 --> 02:16:50.140
memo that was provided as background. As I mentioned earlier, January 2020, we presented

02:16:51.180 --> 02:16:58.180
as an information item to the State Board and today we're making this presentation to

02:16:59.020 --> 02:17:04.660
you for approval.

02:17:04.660 --> 02:17:11.660
Just to indicate what the next steps might be, there is an information item for the Board

02:17:12.660 --> 02:17:19.180
of Governors next week. Then we forward this to the Governor's Office and the legislation

02:17:19.180 --> 02:17:25.340
says that the Governor has at least 30 days to review the document and we have to submit

02:17:25.340 --> 02:17:32.340
to the U.S. Department of Education no later than April 15th.

02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:40.340
The approach we took in developing the plan was from guidance from the Joint Advisory

02:17:43.020 --> 02:17:50.020
Committee, we started with the guiding principles that were laid out by the Joint Advisory Committee

02:17:51.140 --> 02:17:58.140
and we used that as you read the plan through, we mentioned the guiding principles throughout

02:17:59.140 --> 02:18:06.140
the document in terms of how and applied that in various ways in terms of not only the guiding

02:18:06.180 --> 02:18:13.180
principles but we also used in terms of the college and career pathways, the 12 essential

02:18:13.540 --> 02:18:18.900
elements of a high quality college and career pathway.

02:18:18.900 --> 02:18:25.060
We talked a lot about a student-centered high quality college and career pathway and in

02:18:25.100 --> 02:18:32.100
the Perkins legislation there is what is called, which is central to the Perkins legislation

02:18:32.180 --> 02:18:39.180
is what is called a program of study. The program of study is a grade 9 to 14 curricular

02:18:39.620 --> 02:18:46.620
framework with associated supports and that is one of the reasons among many that it is

02:18:47.340 --> 02:18:54.340
a collaboration between LEAs and community colleges at the local level and at the state

02:18:58.900 --> 02:19:05.900
level between the Chancellor's Office and CDE. There is a focused approach on special

02:19:08.180 --> 02:19:14.500
population, just a little bit of history, I won't go into the kind of detail that Tim

02:19:14.500 --> 02:19:21.500
Rainey went through but just a little bit of history. Until Perkins 5, special populations

02:19:23.780 --> 02:19:30.780
were always treated as separately from other special populations, in fact Perkins had its

02:19:31.380 --> 02:19:38.380
unique list of special populations. What has been done under Perkins 5 is to align the

02:19:38.540 --> 02:19:44.380
special population categories to those that are available in ESSA and also within the

02:19:44.380 --> 02:19:51.380
WIOA plan itself. So when LEAs or the state have to address special populations we address

02:19:52.900 --> 02:19:59.900
the same groups that we do under ESSA or any of the local or state funding or any of the

02:20:00.180 --> 02:20:07.180
workforce development programs. So that is I think a unique aspect of Perkins 5 as compared

02:20:08.460 --> 02:20:15.460
to the previous iterations of Perkins. A new federal focus for teacher and faculty

02:20:18.220 --> 02:20:25.220
preparation is teacher and faculty preparation. What the plan has done is to align that new

02:20:25.700 --> 02:20:32.700
federal focus to ongoing state efforts and looking at that particularly in terms of teacher

02:20:32.980 --> 02:20:39.980
credentialing and minimum qualifications for community college faculty.

02:20:39.980 --> 02:20:46.980
And lastly but not least we aligned the Perkins Accountability Framework to the California

02:20:48.900 --> 02:20:54.580
Accountability Framework or the California Accountability Model and in the plan we detailed

02:20:54.580 --> 02:21:01.580
quite extensively about how we have used some of the special population categories.

02:21:02.780 --> 02:21:09.780
The variables or the indicators that are available in the state accountability framework. A good

02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:18.940
example would be in Perkins we are asked to look at what I call secondary quality indicator

02:21:20.260 --> 02:21:27.260
and we are actually looking at what college credit courses which is an element within

02:21:27.260 --> 02:21:34.260
the CCI. So just to briefly go through the plan development

02:21:36.540 --> 02:21:43.540
and consultation. As I said before it is a joint effort by several entities through the

02:21:47.500 --> 02:21:54.500
whole the development and consultation phase. Public comment and response development was

02:21:54.620 --> 02:21:59.340
something that is prominent within the plan as you look at the plan. There are several

02:21:59.340 --> 02:22:04.260
sections and prompts in the plan that talk about how did you do public comment and we

02:22:04.260 --> 02:22:10.020
also had to have public comment for the accountability piece as well and so we did that as well.

02:22:10.020 --> 02:22:16.820
So public comment was quite critical to essentially letting both the LEAs and community colleges

02:22:16.820 --> 02:22:23.820
know about what this plan is about. Then we talked about the state vision for

02:22:23.820 --> 02:22:30.260
education and workforce development and in the plan we are as you heard from Tim Raney

02:22:30.260 --> 02:22:37.260
about the interaction between CDE and community colleges and workforce development and we

02:22:38.300 --> 02:22:45.300
have included language that Tim was referring to within the plan.

02:22:54.740 --> 02:23:01.300
One of the things we did throughout the plan and all of the different strands and prompts

02:23:01.300 --> 02:23:08.300
is to make reference to all of the state programming that is going on within the state and we spent

02:23:08.380 --> 02:23:15.260
a lot of time in terms of many of the programs that the CDE is involved with, the community

02:23:15.260 --> 02:23:19.540
colleges, chancellor's office is involved with what may be happening at the local level

02:23:19.740 --> 02:23:25.060
and we spent a lot of time describing those programs and making that connection to the

02:23:25.060 --> 02:23:32.060
federal effort. We made sure that the state effort was prominent and upfront and essentially

02:23:32.060 --> 02:23:39.060
as this is just the application to the federal, to the U.S. Department of Education for those

02:23:40.140 --> 02:23:45.140
funds. So keep in mind that when we are talking about

02:23:45.660 --> 02:23:52.660
programs of study implementation, one of the things that we should be aware of, the Carl

02:23:52.700 --> 02:23:58.180
Perkins Funds is a funding source, much like it is CTIG, much like it is in the WIOA, it

02:23:58.180 --> 02:24:04.620
is a funding source. But the programs that those funding source, that particular funding

02:24:04.620 --> 02:24:10.140
source helps are our statewide programs. So that is what we have to keep in mind is that

02:24:10.140 --> 02:24:16.700
whether it is a state program as Carolyn was talking about both in terms of Title II

02:24:16.700 --> 02:24:22.460
and the CAPE funds, that is essentially adult programs at the local level but using those

02:24:22.460 --> 02:24:27.540
two sources of funds. Similarly, we do that on the CTE side and that is the one thing

02:24:27.540 --> 02:24:32.460
we have to keep in mind when we are talking about programs and programs of study within

02:24:32.460 --> 02:24:37.920
a CTE. As I talked before, we talked about the embeddedness

02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:44.560
of special population in implementing these different programs in the plan. We described

02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:51.280
a lot of these special program activities. There is a section of special programs where

02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:58.280
we took each of the ten special program categories and described not only in terms of students

02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:03.880
of disability but we also looked, we just spent a little time, we looked at other programs

02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:09.520
like foster youth. We looked at homeless, what the state is doing for homelessness

02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:16.520
and other programs that we described through that process.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:24.200
The final section we looked at, a section we looked at that was new to, definitely at

02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:30.880
the state level, it is new to the LEAs and community colleges. In Perkins, there was

02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:37.480
always funds available for professional development. There were funds always available for professional

02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:44.480
development. What is new under Perkins 5 is that preparing teachers and faculty has

02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:51.960
been elevated. In most states, we meaning CTE or the community colleges are not the

02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:59.080
ones responsible for providing that credential. So we engaged with CTC with the help of state

02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:10.480
board staff, talked to CTC, had conversation with them about how CTE credential occurs

02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:19.160
in California and that has been detailed in the plan itself.

02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:25.560
The other, in this section, we talked about both recruitment and retention and we talked

02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:31.640
about how professional development is currently taking place and what we might do as we move

02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:38.640
forward. At the end of that section, we listed a series of questions that may be a starting

02:26:39.920 --> 02:26:46.920
point to discuss in this area as we develop the larger comprehensive state plan.

02:26:47.800 --> 02:26:54.800
There is a section here in that we talk about fiscal responsibility and budget. We presented

02:26:54.800 --> 02:27:01.800
that to you last time. Nothing much has changed in that. We are still using the same way that

02:27:05.840 --> 02:27:12.840
we allocate funds, both between community colleges and LEAs, but we also are looking

02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:19.840
at how we divide state funding, which is about 15%, and then 85% of those funds have

02:27:21.080 --> 02:27:28.080
to go back to the LEAs or community colleges. The new thing in fiscal responsibility is

02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:35.600
they have raised what is called reserve funds. So off that 85%, there used to be 10% that

02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:43.440
was for reserve funds. Those reserve funds have been increased to 15% and that gives

02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:56.920
us an opportunity to look at areas that are critical to making CTE work. Dual enrollment

02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:04.600
comes to mind. Industry-based certification comes to mind. Teacher preparation and faculty

02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:10.680
comes to mind. All of those areas are something that we can use the reserve funds to move

02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:17.680
that forward. The one section that I would admit to you is close to my heart is the accountability

02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:28.520
section. I spent a lot of time with my colleagues within this department to try and understand

02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:36.040
the California accountability model, the five-by-five grid, and how that relates to the Perkins

02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:43.040
accountability framework and how they are similar but not similar also because in Perkins

02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:50.480
they have, and that's what the state-determined performance levels are, the numerators and

02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:57.480
denominators that there was in ESSA, the denominator is different in Perkins as the state-determined

02:28:58.760 --> 02:29:03.120
performance levels. Then for ESSA and the state-determined performance levels asked

02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:10.120
us to project forward to 2023, some of those we ended up using what was the state projections

02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:20.600
but in some of them we actually, with the help of my colleagues in the assessment division

02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:27.760
as well as within Cindy Kazanis' division, we tried to do some estimates to get the state

02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:35.960
determined performance levels. So based on that, I want to put forward the recommendation

02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:42.460
that is in front of you and then talk about if you have any comments and questions on

02:29:42.460 --> 02:29:43.900
that.

02:29:43.900 --> 02:29:50.900
Hey. We have several liaisons to this work and so I want to ask Ting's son and then

02:29:51.900 --> 02:29:58.900
Felice Ortiz-Lacon and Patricia Rucker each to comment. Ting, you want to start us off?

02:29:58.900 --> 02:30:05.900
All right. So this has been, as Dr. Kodemarchu said, this has been an iterative process,

02:30:07.820 --> 02:30:14.060
I would say an extensive iterative process, and I really appreciate my colleagues on the

02:30:14.060 --> 02:30:21.060
board, member Felice Ortiz-Lacon and member Patricia Rucker for going through this long

02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:28.800
year and a half with me, as well as our community college partners, Jelena Grande, Bill Rawlings

02:30:29.420 --> 02:30:36.420
and Alma Salazar who have also worked on this application with us. So I want you all to

02:30:37.300 --> 02:30:44.300
know that we've been working on the policy end for how K-14 will work together to further

02:30:44.780 --> 02:30:51.780
the work of WIOA and the larger state policies regarding CTE programs. This is what you have

02:30:55.360 --> 02:31:02.280
before you, an application for federal funds. So it is not our full plan. We will continue

02:31:02.280 --> 02:31:08.000
our work. We just want you to know that. So we did take more of a minimalist approach,

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:12.800
if you will, to this. We wanted to be able to set direction in this plan on where we

02:31:12.800 --> 02:31:18.000
want to go, but it is certainly not completely fleshed out. So we want you to be aware of

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:22.920
that, and we hope that over the next year we'll come back to you again with a fuller

02:31:22.920 --> 02:31:29.920
plan beyond what is here in this application. And I want to also just extend my thanks

02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:37.480
and to Dr. Kodemurachu who came into this process, what, six months ago? Eight months

02:31:38.560 --> 02:31:45.560
ago? Okay, and dropped in the midst of our work and has been leading this in a very complicated

02:31:47.480 --> 02:31:54.480
state policy and state education structure. So I really appreciate his time and his work

02:31:54.800 --> 02:31:56.640
on that.

02:31:56.640 --> 02:32:03.640
I would like to think it's not just me. There are a lot of people, particularly in the last

02:32:03.680 --> 02:32:10.200
month, I would like to thank Sandy for helping us with the teacher preparation piece. Without

02:32:10.200 --> 02:32:14.720
her, I don't think we'd have what you have in front of you. And that's been very helpful

02:32:14.720 --> 02:32:20.200
for someone like me that I would admit to you that there's one area of CTE that is not

02:32:20.240 --> 02:32:27.240
my forte. So I relied on people like her and others as well to really produce this document.

02:32:27.800 --> 02:32:29.160
Very true. It's been very collaborative.

02:32:29.160 --> 02:32:33.240
It's a collaborative piece of work that we're very grateful for.

02:32:33.240 --> 02:32:34.240
Yes.

02:32:34.240 --> 02:32:35.240
Member?

02:32:35.240 --> 02:32:42.240
It feels great to be at this point where we're getting ready to submit this. There has been

02:32:42.640 --> 02:32:48.040
conversations for the past couple of years. One of the things that I find to be a strength

02:32:48.080 --> 02:32:54.280
of this process was that we started with principles and a vision. So this is an application, but

02:32:54.280 --> 02:33:00.800
our principles are threaded throughout. And I think that it's been a bumpy road at times,

02:33:00.800 --> 02:33:06.000
but I think we're in a good place now to submit the application and then resume the conversation

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:11.240
about our larger vision for this work. One of the things that was also kind of unique

02:33:11.240 --> 02:33:16.440
about this plan is that we have to integrate it and align it with ESSA. So there was a

02:33:16.480 --> 02:33:22.980
lot of conversations between what ESSA meant for our work, what Perkins 5, and then the

02:33:22.980 --> 02:33:26.920
community college. So in a way, we had a little family reunion and we're trying to figure

02:33:26.920 --> 02:33:32.520
out what our higher ed folks do. So we've learned a lot about the work that even though

02:33:32.520 --> 02:33:37.360
we're in the same system of educating students, we're not always using the same language or

02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:41.600
approach. So it's been a great experience, but I'm happy that we're finally at this

02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:43.760
point where we could submit the application.

02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:53.520
So let me begin by saying, by channeling my dad, he used to sit at the dinner table when

02:33:53.520 --> 02:33:58.720
he was ready to talk about his work day and he would say, you know, I love work. I'm fascinated

02:33:58.720 --> 02:34:05.720
by it. I could sit and watch other people do it for hours. And so that's kind of what,

02:34:06.080 --> 02:34:12.120
that's a good way of describing what happened with this process and this plan. A lot of

02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:19.120
work, a lot of time, a lot of learning together went into the development of this packet.

02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:26.040
And even though it is only an application and even though it only is operating at the

02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:33.040
top line, it's 205 pages of a very important public statement about what this state says

02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:41.920
it wants to try to do. So in that sense, it's very aspirational. And in that sense, it's

02:34:42.440 --> 02:34:48.480
also means we are holding ourselves accountable in a very different way. And I think there's

02:34:48.480 --> 02:34:54.520
an important point to make here. One of the things that we board members tried to do in

02:34:54.520 --> 02:34:59.960
educating our colleagues was about our state's accountability system. And we worked very

02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:05.920
hard to create an alignment and come to some way in this plan to make sure that it would

02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:12.320
be aligned with very high expectations for outcomes for these programs. But there is

02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:18.760
a very important detail and key point to make. Our state's accountability system is based

02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:25.760
on an enumerated list of accountability principles and criteria, but also an enumerated list

02:35:26.740 --> 02:35:32.440
of students who are the critical subgroups that we will hold ourselves accountable for.

02:35:32.440 --> 02:35:38.440
The Perkins plan is only interested in one particular student subgroup and those are

02:35:38.440 --> 02:35:45.440
CTE concentrators. And while those CTE concentrators will fall across all of the subgroups that

02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:53.440
we are accountable for in our statewide accountability system, students who are CTE concentrators

02:35:53.720 --> 02:36:00.720
are not a student subgroup in our accountability system. And so we had to work very hard to

02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:07.960
figure out a way to find consonance between those two very distinct sets of accountability

02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:14.600
and outcomes to make sure that the plan was both aspirational but had very tough standards

02:36:14.600 --> 02:36:20.320
for the outcomes of these programs for these students. So what I would like to say is with

02:36:20.320 --> 02:36:23.640
this application, it's a good start.

02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:30.640
Are there any specific clarifying questions at this point before we go to public comment?

02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:36.840
If not, we'll come back for deeper discussion. Any clarifying questions? Seeing none, we'll

02:36:36.840 --> 02:36:38.880
go to public comment.

02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:43.880
Angela DeRamos.

02:36:43.880 --> 02:36:50.880
Good morning. Angela DeRamos on behalf of California Teachers Association. We'd like

02:36:54.480 --> 02:37:00.440
to thank and commend the CBE and SBE for their hard work on the Perkins 5. We would like

02:37:00.480 --> 02:37:05.040
to call your attention to the overarching need to address the key barriers to ensuring

02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:10.600
that students have access to well-qualified educators that are credentialed in the subjects

02:37:10.600 --> 02:37:16.880
held. The plan states that the current efforts and approaches tend to be piecemeal and suggests

02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:22.320
that a much more integrated systemic approach is needed in building the faculty for the

02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:27.080
faculty pipeline. CTE strongly agrees and believes that the key questions brought up

02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:32.560
in the plan regarding the teacher pipeline are crucial to success not only of the Perkins

02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:38.560
plan but also CareerTech Ed in general. We would also like to reiterate that there must

02:37:38.560 --> 02:37:42.760
be alignment between the accountability for results section of the plan and the state's

02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:48.240
current accountability goals as defined by the LCAP and the dashboard systems. Otherwise,

02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:54.080
we run the risk of creating a lower performance expectation for CTE students, which is an

02:37:54.080 --> 02:38:04.080
unintended consequence. Thank you. That's it. All right. Discussion.

02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:12.080
Remember, Navo, did you turn your microphone on for?

02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:14.080
I decided not to. Now I decided I will.

02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:18.080
You looked like you were getting ready to speak.

02:38:18.080 --> 02:38:25.080
It's more of a question for the board liaisons, I think. So one of the things that comes up

02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:31.080
is obviously producing the highly qualified professional workforce to educate our students.

02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:35.080
And what I noticed in the plan and what I recall from superintendent, which was a long

02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:41.080
time ago, is the designated subjects for those are not required to go through any kind of

02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:46.080
licensure or an induction program, although it's offered. They're not required to have

02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:53.080
a certification for those designated subjects for CTE. And I know it's just a draft unless

02:38:53.080 --> 02:38:57.080
I'm misinterpreting it. Is there a plan going forward or is that something that we need

02:38:57.080 --> 02:39:05.080
to think about going forward as we develop these applications? It's on page 129 as I read it.

02:39:05.080 --> 02:39:11.080
There is a certification. There's several. There is a certification process.

02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:16.080
So when I read it, what it's telling me is that the DS CTE credential candidates are

02:39:16.080 --> 02:39:21.080
not currently required to complete teacher induction to earn their clearance. Yeah, that's

02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:27.080
what I'm talking about. Right. And then below that it says CTE teachers are not required

02:39:27.080 --> 02:39:33.080
for licensure. So what I'm trying to figure out, where does the support come from?

02:39:35.080 --> 02:39:39.080
We've got three people here who have a little connection to the commission and we're all

02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:47.080
kind of scratching our heads. Yeah. So either I'm misinterpreting it or and I could be.

02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:55.080
Just basically what it's saying to me is none of it's required. There is a credentialing

02:39:55.080 --> 02:40:05.080
requirement for the initial license for sure for CTE teachers. And I did not know that

02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:13.080
induction would have been waived. In fact, one of the things that CTE and that CTC has

02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:18.080
been working on for quite a while is creating multiple pathways to that credential because

02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:23.080
we now have people who come straight from industry in the traditional sense and they

02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:30.080
add on education courses to their knowledge base about whatever their skill set is. But

02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:35.080
we also have people coming because so many of the fields are new STEM fields and their

02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:40.080
physics and astrophysics and things like that. We have people coming from the traditional

02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:47.080
college majors and then needing to pick up some work experience. So there is a credentialing

02:40:47.080 --> 02:40:51.080
structure and it looks like we're about to get some additional insight. Thank you.

02:40:51.080 --> 02:40:59.080
We've just started to have conversations with Mary Sandy and CTC to look at different

02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:04.080
options that we have. I know we have the designated subject and single subject, but we are trying

02:41:04.080 --> 02:41:11.080
to explore if there are other options there. But keeping in mind that CTE is critical to

02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:17.080
that option and just as we move forward. So we're going to start having this conversation

02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:28.080
once we put this application to bed so to speak. I think we should just double as we're

02:41:29.080 --> 02:41:36.080
doing our editing on this which we have included as a part of the recommendation we should

02:41:37.080 --> 02:41:42.080
double check the wording on this so that it is not misleading. I think the one that you

02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:49.080
are looking at is the CTE Teach program which under Perkins 4 we funded it out of Perkins

02:41:51.080 --> 02:41:58.080
4 fund. That really is for teachers that are there so it's not really a licensure program

02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:07.080
much more so like a professional development program. So we'll make that clear in the

02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:13.080
language. And I think that the question is about the statement that DSCT credential

02:42:13.080 --> 02:42:17.080
candidates are not currently required to complete teacher induction to earn their

02:42:17.080 --> 02:42:22.080
credential. I think maybe this program is not required, that particular program, but

02:42:22.080 --> 02:42:28.080
I think an induction program of some kind is required. So we should be sure that that's

02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:35.080
just clarified in the language. Member Rucker? I think maybe the best way to explain this

02:42:35.080 --> 02:42:40.080
for people in the public who don't have this document in front of them, the document

02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:48.080
specifically says that these designated subjects credential teachers are not required to complete

02:42:48.080 --> 02:42:53.080
teacher induction to earn their credential. There is a credential program and teacher

02:42:53.080 --> 02:43:01.080
induction as a practice and as a policy premise posits a responsibility both for the state

02:43:01.080 --> 02:43:07.080
in supporting teacher professional development and certification but also on the employer.

02:43:07.080 --> 02:43:15.080
So where there isn't a state induction program, the employer has a responsibility to provide

02:43:15.080 --> 02:43:21.080
induction. Let's remember the purpose of induction is to support the transition of teachers

02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:28.080
beginning their profession as an educator into the work that they are doing. And so

02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:34.080
when California created their induction program, there was a responsibility for employers

02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:40.080
to provide professional development and support to these new credential candidates as well

02:43:40.080 --> 02:43:45.080
as a condition of the candidates earning their professional clear credential. Remember it

02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:50.080
is the employer, not the state, that recommends these candidates for their professional clear

02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:56.080
credential. So probably what needed to be said here is that there's a responsibility,

02:43:56.080 --> 02:44:01.080
even though they don't participate in a state-sponsored induction program, the employers

02:44:01.080 --> 02:44:06.080
have a responsibility to provide that professional support for induction. That might be helpful.

02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:11.080
Does that make sense, Dr. Hamm? Yeah, and I think we can have this all evaluated with

02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:16.080
the help of the CTC so that we get exactly right. Right. And what I was going to say

02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:22.080
is what we can take from this particular section, as Dr. Cardamati said, this was a section

02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:28.080
that was not necessarily sunshineed before. So in doing that, what we're seeing is that

02:44:28.080 --> 02:44:35.080
there are different pathways for individuals to become qualified credentialed to be CTE

02:44:35.080 --> 02:44:42.080
teachers, but each of them have their challenges and their issues. And they're disjointed,

02:44:43.580 --> 02:44:49.580
and it's not clear depending on the type of industry. And so it varies quite a bit. And

02:44:49.580 --> 02:44:55.580
what we want to try to do is have some more alignment, and that integrated approach is

02:44:55.580 --> 02:45:02.580
a public comment about a more integrated approach to the credentialing of CTE teachers. And

02:45:02.580 --> 02:45:08.580
one that will help to invite those who are out in industry, who have those qualifications

02:45:08.580 --> 02:45:13.580
to bring that into our education system. So there's a lot of work to be done here, we

02:45:13.580 --> 02:45:19.580
know that. And this is one of the key areas that we want to focus on moving forward.

02:45:19.580 --> 02:45:25.580
Are there other questions? Comments? Yes? I just kind of wanted to echo what Member

02:45:30.580 --> 02:45:35.580
Rucker mentioned before. I know that it can be seen as just an application, but I do think

02:45:35.580 --> 02:45:41.580
it's promising that there has been this much effort and care put into it. Like we've just

02:45:41.580 --> 02:45:46.580
been talking about, there still is a lot of work to be done, but if we use this as a

02:45:46.580 --> 02:45:52.580
vision and keep building upon that, I think that we'll be moving in the right direction.

02:45:52.580 --> 02:45:58.580
All right. Do I have a motion? I will make motion, but right before I do that, I also

02:45:58.580 --> 02:46:04.580
want to thank one other person, Patricia DeCoss, who has been a champion in this process as

02:46:04.580 --> 02:46:10.580
well and helping to keep us all on track and moving forward in this effort. So thank you,

02:46:10.580 --> 02:46:16.580
Patricia. All right. So with that, I will make a motion to approve the California

02:46:18.580 --> 02:46:24.580
Department's recommendation that we approve these draft Federal Perkins V State Plan and

02:46:24.580 --> 02:46:30.580
forward the plan to the governor's office for a 30-day review. And in addition, that we

02:46:31.580 --> 02:46:37.580
allow the CDE in collaboration with SBE staff to make any necessary non-substantive clarifying

02:46:37.580 --> 02:46:43.580
edits. Okay. Do I have a second? Member Ortiz-Lacone, is there any further discussion?

02:46:46.580 --> 02:46:53.580
All right. All in favor say aye. Any opposed say nay. Any abstentions? All right. Motion

02:46:53.580 --> 02:46:59.580
carries. Yay! Okay. Because you've been so expeditious, we're going to keep going. I

02:47:03.580 --> 02:47:09.580
think we can finish one more before lunch. And so item five is the accountability item.

02:47:12.580 --> 02:47:18.580
And the CDE recommends that we provide guidance on the revisions under consideration for the

02:47:18.580 --> 02:47:24.580
2020 dashboard and take additional action as deemed necessary and appropriate. This item

02:47:24.580 --> 02:47:30.580
will be presented by Cindy Kazanis from the CDE. You didn't think you'd be up before lunch,

02:47:30.580 --> 02:47:36.580
did you? I was so pleased that Pradeep did so well. And it will be equally efficient.

02:47:39.580 --> 02:47:45.580
Great. Wonderful. A nice lunch. Yes. So again, Cindy Kazanis, the Director of the Analysis

02:47:46.580 --> 02:47:52.580
Measurement Account of the Reporting Division. It's a pleasure to be with you this morning

02:47:52.580 --> 02:47:57.580
and walk you through what we're thinking about for this year and get your feedback on our

02:47:57.580 --> 02:48:03.580
work plan. So this is something that we've done the last couple of March items is to

02:48:03.580 --> 02:48:08.580
bring forward the work plan for the year to make sure we're on track for what you're

02:48:08.580 --> 02:48:13.580
expecting for us for changes for the dashboard. So I'm going to walk you through the three

02:48:13.580 --> 02:48:18.580
different attachments and then we can open it up for questions or whatever. President

02:48:18.580 --> 02:48:25.580
Dirlingham would like us to do. So the recommendation is to for you to forget to give us guidance

02:48:25.580 --> 02:48:30.580
on any revisions under consideration for the 2020 dashboard and take action as deemed

02:48:30.580 --> 02:48:37.580
necessary and appropriate. So first we're going to start with what we're thinking about

02:48:37.580 --> 02:48:42.580
for 2020. We have a slide that talks about beyond 2020. And then we're going to have

02:48:43.580 --> 02:48:48.580
a whole separate attachment around the English Learner Progress Indicator. So the first one

02:48:48.580 --> 02:48:52.580
that I'm going to talk about is student growth model, which of course has been years in the

02:48:52.580 --> 02:48:57.580
making. Additional measures for the college career indicator, additional career measures

02:48:57.580 --> 02:49:02.580
rather. We're going to talk through how we can stabilize or change over time the state

02:49:02.580 --> 02:49:06.580
indicators and then as I mentioned talk a little bit about the English Learner Progress

02:49:06.580 --> 02:49:13.580
Indicator. So after many years in development and in 2019 taking a break and talking with

02:49:15.580 --> 02:49:19.580
stakeholders, we're ready to move forward with incorporating a student growth model

02:49:19.580 --> 02:49:25.580
into the dashboard. I will talk a little bit towards the end about how we would plan on

02:49:25.580 --> 02:49:31.580
doing that, but just to walk you through where we've been and where we're headed. So we

02:49:32.580 --> 02:49:38.580
had, as you directed us in 2018 to work with stakeholders to get further input on the dashboard

02:49:38.580 --> 02:49:44.580
or rather on the growth model including it in the dashboard, we spent 2019 working with

02:49:44.580 --> 02:49:50.580
a stakeholder group that had been developed and facilitated through WestEd. So WestEd

02:49:50.580 --> 02:49:56.580
provided you a memo of those four meetings that took place, a summary of that in November

02:49:56.580 --> 02:50:02.580
last year. And in those discussions we were able to clarify goals that stakeholders wanted

02:50:02.580 --> 02:50:08.580
the growth model to meet and help set expectations for interpretations of the reports. So of

02:50:10.580 --> 02:50:16.580
course we've been focused on the residual gain model that you have heard from us over

02:50:16.580 --> 02:50:22.580
the last couple of years. We're looking at in 2020 how additional modifications to this

02:50:22.580 --> 02:50:28.580
model could enhance validity and cross time stability and as part of this we will be of

02:50:28.580 --> 02:50:34.580
course working with our testing contractor ETS to do some of this work for us or on our

02:50:34.580 --> 02:50:40.580
behalf. And when we think about this model as well we are also keeping in mind your prior

02:50:40.580 --> 02:50:46.580
guidance in not including student demographics of the control variable in the growth model.

02:50:46.580 --> 02:50:52.580
So with that in mind some of the work that will need to be done this year is to look

02:50:52.580 --> 02:50:58.580
through or rather work with again our assessments division and with Mal and her staff on

02:50:58.580 --> 02:51:04.580
making adjustments potentially to the highest obtainable scale score which is something

02:51:04.580 --> 02:51:10.580
that California has adopted Smarter Balances highest obtainable scale score but there are

02:51:10.580 --> 02:51:14.580
other states within the Smarter Balanced Consortium that have actually done some work and

02:51:14.580 --> 02:51:20.580
adopted different scale scores. We'll think about making some technical adjustments and modifying

02:51:20.580 --> 02:51:26.580
business rules for inclusion of student scores in the model. All that to say we will be spending time with our technical

02:51:26.580 --> 02:51:30.580
experts and we'll make sure that when we complete this work that we take it out for

02:51:30.580 --> 02:51:36.580
public consumption once the technical and the ability of the model has been achieved.

02:51:36.580 --> 02:51:42.580
So in doing that I talked a little bit already about working with the test contractor now that we have

02:51:42.580 --> 02:51:48.580
an additional year of data they can rerun the modeling that they've already done and making the technical

02:51:48.580 --> 02:51:53.580
adjustments that we think that we're going to have recommendations for. We will bring back that same

02:51:53.580 --> 02:51:57.580
growth model stakeholder work group that met four times last year to obtain additional

02:51:57.580 --> 02:52:03.580
feedback and then obviously take it out to the rest of our stakeholders. So we think that

02:52:03.580 --> 02:52:09.580
we will be talking to you about this much more in 2020. Our recommendation would be to

02:52:09.580 --> 02:52:15.580
implement it in the dashboard for informational purposes for this year and then spend next spring

02:52:15.580 --> 02:52:21.580
or late winter and spring talking through what does it mean? How can schools and districts use it?

02:52:21.580 --> 02:52:27.580
But also partnering with our assessments division to highlight existing resources for parents who have

02:52:27.580 --> 02:52:33.580
student score reports who have seen the growth on those student score reports since the inception of the

02:52:33.580 --> 02:52:39.580
new test, the CASP test for the last five years to make sure that we also

02:52:39.580 --> 02:52:45.580
focus on how parents can look at students score reports and then what does a

02:52:45.580 --> 02:52:51.580
growth model actually mean in terms of using it on the dashboard? So all that to say we have

02:52:51.580 --> 02:52:57.580
communications, a great deal of communications work ahead especially once this information

02:52:57.580 --> 02:53:03.580
is included on the dashboard. So for the college career indicator, we of course spent

02:53:06.580 --> 02:53:12.580
a long afternoon back in May talking through what the college career indicator was, whether it was

02:53:12.580 --> 02:53:18.580
college and career, college or career. I think we're still at college career indicator, college slash career.

02:53:18.580 --> 02:53:24.580
Let's just revisit that. We didn't really have a final decision. It was a study session.

02:53:24.580 --> 02:53:30.580
But we have already spent actually four different full day meetings in

02:53:30.580 --> 02:53:36.580
February talking to our policy work groups as well as the technical design group about

02:53:36.580 --> 02:53:42.580
things. And specifically around the college career indicator, we not only have the alternative schools task force group, but we also

02:53:42.580 --> 02:53:48.580
have our college career work group, our college career indicator work group, but there's an accountability

02:53:48.580 --> 02:53:54.580
subgroup to that. So we've been getting quite a bit of feedback on the data that we've collected this last year.

02:53:54.580 --> 02:54:00.580
So as far as additional measures, we've been really focused on the career measures and trying to do a better job in collecting

02:54:00.580 --> 02:54:06.580
data that we didn't have prior to the college career indicator being

02:54:06.580 --> 02:54:12.580
measured in the dashboard. So what you can see from this slide is that we are

02:54:12.580 --> 02:54:18.580
we've been working with the groups to collect additional data through CALPADS through our student level data system. And then we've also been focused on

02:54:18.580 --> 02:54:24.580
making sure that we have ones that represent our alternative schools, which of course is over 10 percent of our population.

02:54:24.580 --> 02:54:30.580
So in doing that, we did collect what you see on the screen in CALPADS in 2018-19.

02:54:30.580 --> 02:54:36.580
So the quality of this data and the quantity of this data from districts is

02:54:36.580 --> 02:54:42.580
something that we are doing our due diligence on right now and reviewing.

02:54:42.580 --> 02:54:48.580
There are certain aspects of these measures that had better collection than others.

02:54:48.580 --> 02:54:54.580
And in doing that, we will bring forward to you, most likely in the summer,

02:54:54.580 --> 02:55:00.580
what measures we think would be appropriate for inclusion in the dashboard.

02:55:00.580 --> 02:55:06.580
What I wanted to make a comment on is some of these are limited to our dashboard alternative school status,

02:55:06.580 --> 02:55:12.580
which of course we determined are more appropriate for them because there's not a way to demonstrate

02:55:12.580 --> 02:55:18.580
completion of a full semester, perhaps, or something more longer that you would see in a traditional school.

02:55:18.580 --> 02:55:24.580
But all these have come through and been vetted through both policy workgroups.

02:55:24.580 --> 02:55:28.580
These are pieces that we're going to continue to work on this spring.

02:55:28.580 --> 02:55:34.580
And then for the next steps, we'll make sure that the measures that we've collected

02:55:34.580 --> 02:55:40.580
and bring forward to you are, of course, valid and reliable and can be used to determine

02:55:40.580 --> 02:55:46.580
whether or not a student is approaching prepared or prepared so that we do have some technical work ahead of us on this piece.

02:55:46.580 --> 02:55:56.580
I would also say just that you're going to see a slide in a couple of minutes about the additional inclusions beyond 2020.

02:55:56.580 --> 02:56:00.580
So there's definitely interest from, I think, from you all in expanding this out,

02:56:00.580 --> 02:56:06.580
continuing to expand out the college per indicator to make it more robust as we move forward.

02:56:06.580 --> 02:56:10.580
So the next piece is looking at stability of state indicators.

02:56:10.580 --> 02:56:18.580
And this is in keeping with continually improving our dashboard and looking back on the original decision that was made

02:56:18.580 --> 02:56:27.580
four years ago in establishing cut scores for each of the indicators and making those distributions at the local education agency level.

02:56:27.580 --> 02:56:33.580
We have determined that the methodology is relatively stable.

02:56:33.580 --> 02:56:39.580
However, the board did take action back in November 2017 to make adjustments to the academic indicator.

02:56:39.580 --> 02:56:46.580
So we've heard some concerns expressed in the field about the movement of colors within the indicators outside of the mathematics English language arts.

02:56:46.580 --> 02:56:50.580
Sometimes you will see schools or districts move a couple of colors.

02:56:50.580 --> 02:56:52.580
And why is that happening?

02:56:52.580 --> 02:57:02.580
And so we're going to take some time this spring to also look at making sure that what we've been using continues to be stable as we have, of course,

02:57:02.580 --> 02:57:11.580
additional data points we can better inform about how to how to proceed or if we have maybe some changes we recommend to you.

02:57:11.580 --> 02:57:19.580
So one of the things that folks have been providing us feedback on is why can't you just adopt what we've been using for our small student populations,

02:57:19.580 --> 02:57:27.580
which is, of course, a three by five grade, which means you've narrowed in the ability to be on the extremes.

02:57:27.580 --> 02:57:36.580
So currently, of course, you've adopted that for the graduation rate indicator, suspension rate indicator, chronic absenteeism indicator and the college career indicator.

02:57:36.580 --> 02:57:43.580
And these are the different cohorts that our application that we use for that that student group information.

02:57:43.580 --> 02:57:53.580
So we'll be taking a look at the three by five as a method, but also looking at whether or not it could be applied for large student populations.

02:57:53.580 --> 02:58:05.580
So in thinking about making sure that what we've currently been using for for our five by fives is stable, that we can justify movement of colors,

02:58:05.580 --> 02:58:08.580
we're going to bring back to you some some options moving forward.

02:58:08.580 --> 02:58:18.580
And one of those options would be looking at making sure it's on the next it is on the next page, looking at applying what we've done for the academic indicator to the rest of the indicators.

02:58:18.580 --> 02:58:22.580
Eliminating the colors on each row to two colors as opposed to three.

02:58:22.580 --> 02:58:27.580
Some of them have three colors and potentially eliminating our three by five grid.

02:58:27.580 --> 02:58:41.580
So we'll be again getting out to not only our policy workgroups and the technical workgroups to express how we how we move forward and the recommendations we make to make sure that the system continues to be stable,

02:58:41.580 --> 02:58:52.580
that we're not having concerns about, you know, folks moving with a drop from from a blue to or dropping down or again vice versa.

02:58:52.580 --> 02:59:01.580
OK. And then beyond 2020, I'm going to talk through a couple of these and then move on to the English Under Progress Indicator.

02:59:01.580 --> 02:59:18.580
We are we have actually a student intern that just graduated from UC Santa Barbara, who's helping us review potentially using the Armed Services Vocational Optitude Battery Assessment, which of course is used for students who are wishing to go into the military.

02:59:18.580 --> 02:59:24.580
But there's also opportunities for students to get access to certain career tools by taking this exam.

02:59:24.580 --> 02:59:28.580
So we are looking at who else uses it.

02:59:28.580 --> 02:59:32.580
So far we've seen our neighboring state of Nevada uses it in their accountability system.

02:59:32.580 --> 02:59:34.580
What are the benefits of it?

02:59:34.580 --> 02:59:37.580
What are the concerns of it and potential limitations of it?

02:59:37.580 --> 02:59:42.580
And one off the bat is we cannot get this data from the test vendor.

02:59:42.580 --> 02:59:45.580
We'd have to actually collect it from local educational agencies.

02:59:45.580 --> 02:59:48.580
So that is something that we're focused on.

02:59:48.580 --> 02:59:52.580
We are also focused on as a result of your discussions last year, the state still of civic engagement.

02:59:52.580 --> 03:00:06.580
So we've been working with Barbara Richardson and her staff to come up with a small working group that would work through how we would potentially bring state still of civic engagement, which you have not yet adopted, of course, into the accountability system.

03:00:06.580 --> 03:00:10.580
So that is work that we plan to engage in early this year as well.

03:00:10.580 --> 03:00:21.580
And then another pending thing that we've all been reminded of often is the inclusion of the California Science Test, the CAST into the accountability system.

03:00:21.580 --> 03:00:33.580
So we're proposing that we would be able to work on creating status cut scores for the 2021 dashboard and a performance color for the 2022 dashboard.

03:00:33.580 --> 03:00:38.580
So I don't know if you'd like me to pause. That's a lot before we move on to the LP.

03:00:38.580 --> 03:00:42.580
And I do have Jenny Singh and Jonathan Issa here to respond to questions as well.

03:00:42.580 --> 03:00:46.580
Oh, you know what? I have one extra slide before I get to attachment to that.

03:00:46.580 --> 03:00:49.580
That would probably be better to finish this one out.

03:00:49.580 --> 03:01:06.580
There was also in talking with our stakeholders, actually our equity stakeholders, there was a mention made about the requirement under Education Code Section 52064.5 about bringing in students with school level data received from another entity to utilize in local indicators.

03:01:06.580 --> 03:01:14.580
And I think early on we thought a good first data set for that would be the California Teacher, the credentialing commission data.

03:01:14.580 --> 03:01:17.580
We've had an existing data sharing group with them for several years now.

03:01:17.580 --> 03:01:24.580
However, they've been in the midst of implementing a new data system themselves. Of course, we don't have a shared data system.

03:01:24.580 --> 03:01:28.580
We're doing this complicated match process.

03:01:28.580 --> 03:01:32.580
So the first time we'll have a full set of data will be this fall from them.

03:01:32.580 --> 03:01:41.580
So we're going to be spending time once we get that data to see if it would be the language in the legislation is relevant and reliable.

03:01:41.580 --> 03:01:56.580
So if it meets that standard, by other way, we'd bring forward to you our progress on reviewing that data set for potentially preloading that into the local indicator data set so that districts wouldn't have to input their own information twice, right?

03:01:56.580 --> 03:02:01.580
Because they're already giving it to us through CALPADS and then through a match with the Commission on Teacher Credentialing.

03:02:01.580 --> 03:02:03.580
So this is a piece I just wanted to mention.

03:02:04.580 --> 03:02:12.580
The budget currently, this current year does include some funding to San Joaquin County Office of Education to start on this work.

03:02:12.580 --> 03:02:20.580
They actually have to start over on the school accountability report card program.

03:02:20.580 --> 03:02:24.580
They have to rewrite that program as the foundation for this work moving forward.

03:02:24.580 --> 03:02:29.580
So there's additional funding that's proposed for next year to work on this.

03:02:29.580 --> 03:02:33.580
This is actually a pretty big infrastructure that would have to be built.

03:02:33.580 --> 03:02:37.580
We could do it manually in the beginning, but this is something that will take some time.

03:02:37.580 --> 03:02:40.580
So I just wanted to mention that this is on our radar as well.

03:02:40.580 --> 03:02:43.580
And with that, I would defer to.

03:02:43.580 --> 03:02:44.580
Great.

03:02:44.580 --> 03:02:49.580
Member Rucker, member Sun, member Ortiz-LaCone.

03:02:49.580 --> 03:02:51.580
All right, go ahead.

03:02:51.580 --> 03:02:56.580
Cindy, your presentations are always endlessly fascinating to me.

03:02:56.580 --> 03:03:02.580
I think that either means I have no balance in my life or I actually don't understand what you're saying.

03:03:02.580 --> 03:03:11.580
Could you go back to the slide where you had the list of other data points under consideration for inclusion in the CCI?

03:03:11.580 --> 03:03:16.580
Some are, so my question for these, and I find this a fascinating list.

03:03:16.580 --> 03:03:24.580
My question about some of these is, are there some differences between them like from who the data would be collected?

03:03:24.580 --> 03:03:29.580
And also, are some of these, would they be considered as lagging indicators?

03:03:29.580 --> 03:03:31.580
That's my first question.

03:03:31.580 --> 03:03:37.580
So these data points are all being collected through our student level data system.

03:03:37.580 --> 03:03:40.580
That's what I would say first.

03:03:40.580 --> 03:03:47.580
As far as lagging indicators, they're as good as the data year we're using for everybody we've caught up.

03:03:47.580 --> 03:03:51.580
So we would use it for the cohort of the year that we were working in.

03:03:51.580 --> 03:03:57.580
So for 2020, we would see 2020 data from each of these measures.

03:03:57.580 --> 03:03:58.580
Okay.

03:03:58.580 --> 03:04:04.580
Then my next question is, as it relates to the work you did on the previous item on the Perkins Plan,

03:04:04.580 --> 03:04:08.580
because there's a definition of what a CTE concentrator is,

03:04:08.580 --> 03:04:21.580
you worked with the CTE folks to call the information from the student data system for the students who meet that criteria.

03:04:21.580 --> 03:04:31.580
So I'm curious as to why CTE concentrators is not included on this list as a possible data point that could be added to the CCI.

03:04:31.580 --> 03:04:32.580
I'm going to bring up Jenny.

03:04:32.580 --> 03:04:37.580
She knows this like the back of her hand.

03:04:37.580 --> 03:04:44.580
So the definition of CTE concentrators is actually a CTE completer.

03:04:44.580 --> 03:04:46.580
That's the way it is defined in the plan.

03:04:46.580 --> 03:04:47.580
I understand that.

03:04:47.580 --> 03:04:53.580
And we do have, CTE completers have been included in the CCI since the very beginning.

03:04:53.580 --> 03:04:56.580
Okay, so maybe I didn't ask my question correctly.

03:04:56.580 --> 03:05:10.580
So for the data that you're collecting about CTE completers, is that directly related to the definition that's now in the Perkins Plan we just approved?

03:05:10.580 --> 03:05:11.580
Yes.

03:05:11.580 --> 03:05:12.580
Okay.

03:05:12.580 --> 03:05:15.580
That's probably the question I should have asked instead.

03:05:15.580 --> 03:05:18.580
And then my last question is for Cindy.

03:05:18.580 --> 03:05:31.580
So the last slide you had was related to considerations about how to use data that would be collected by another entity.

03:05:31.580 --> 03:05:41.580
I'm going to renew my request that, again, as it relates to the CCI and the development and collection of data points for the CCI,

03:05:41.580 --> 03:05:54.580
there are other state entities that are funded by the Budget Act from the legislature who also collect data about our K-12 students as it relates to college going,

03:05:54.580 --> 03:06:03.580
as it relates to CTE participation, and some of their data is more granular and more particular about the kinds of information they have.

03:06:03.580 --> 03:06:13.580
I still think there's an opportunity for us to look at and understand those data systems as well and how we can use those data systems,

03:06:13.580 --> 03:06:18.580
particularly from the community college chancellor's office, to also inform some of this work.

03:06:19.580 --> 03:06:26.580
So I would like to ask you to also add a button or a dot or something to this to-do list,

03:06:26.580 --> 03:06:35.580
because this board, while Board Member Lee Cohn and Board Member Sun and I have seen some of that and participated in those discussions,

03:06:35.580 --> 03:06:43.580
the rest of the board doesn't know about some of the other data systems out there and the kind of data they have the ability to collect and the way they do their work.

03:06:43.580 --> 03:06:49.580
I think it's important for us to take a look at that and consider whether or not it could inform what we're attempting to do,

03:06:49.580 --> 03:06:59.580
because what we keep hearing a lot of times is what is the limitations of our current student data system that I believe some of these other data systems could address.

03:06:59.580 --> 03:07:05.580
So I think that that's also an important bullet to add in particular to that particular slide.

03:07:06.580 --> 03:07:10.580
We'll do. We do have a data sharing agreement with the community colleges and we've been giving them data.

03:07:10.580 --> 03:07:14.580
However, we haven't received any data back, so that's on our to-do list.

03:07:14.580 --> 03:07:20.580
And then the other thing is I would say I am a designee for the superintendent on the cradle to career work group.

03:07:20.580 --> 03:07:28.580
And so these kinds of issues are definitely being, it's all state agencies at the table, and so it's actually brought out a lot.

03:07:28.580 --> 03:07:30.580
I understand that, but it's not on this list.

03:07:30.580 --> 03:07:39.580
I understand. And I think to your point, we are working with the low-hanging fruit, which is data that we've currently been getting.

03:07:39.580 --> 03:07:44.580
We will add community colleges to the list, but I don't currently have that data.

03:07:44.580 --> 03:07:47.580
Yeah, because I think that fruit's even lower than what's on this list.

03:07:50.580 --> 03:07:56.580
Okay, so Member Rueck and I are thinking exactly alike. So my comments are around the CCI as well.

03:07:56.580 --> 03:08:06.580
Great. It's really nice to see that CDE is working on all of these additional measures that can be incorporated and that you're doing a lot of research.

03:08:06.580 --> 03:08:18.580
And I would also agree with Member Rueck that there's data out there that can be collected from other entities that you might want to explore and utilize.

03:08:19.580 --> 03:08:32.580
I will say that as you are developing this and what I would hope is that as you're collecting this data, trying to remove some of the burden of putting more and more information by the LEAs.

03:08:32.580 --> 03:08:43.580
But at the same time, if you're collecting data and some of this data is coming from outside of, beyond the LEA or the schools, that you somehow be able to reflect that back to the schools.

03:08:43.580 --> 03:08:50.580
Because at this point from the CCI, information goes out into cowpads.

03:08:50.580 --> 03:09:03.580
There's a calculation on which students end up in certain levels, but the schools and the LEAs don't necessarily know where, which students hit which levels and what you're counting.

03:09:04.580 --> 03:09:09.580
And so it feels a little bit like they're operating a little bit blindly.

03:09:09.580 --> 03:09:16.580
They send information in, but they are not quite sure exactly how it all got calculated.

03:09:16.580 --> 03:09:30.580
And so as you're looking at that, especially if you're collecting data from outside of the LEAs, then somehow being able to reflect that data back to them so they can double check and see, oh, I didn't know the student was on this and that.

03:09:30.580 --> 03:09:33.580
It would be really helpful, I think, for them.

03:09:33.580 --> 03:09:44.580
Just to make sure I'm understanding, I think what you're suggesting is to perhaps without a report or provide a student level data set for the college career indicator to LEAs to be able to check their work.

03:09:44.580 --> 03:09:47.580
Yes, please. Thank you. Very succinctly said. Thank you.

03:09:47.580 --> 03:09:51.580
That is not low-hanging fruit. I want to be clear.

03:09:51.580 --> 03:09:56.580
We're going to be evaluating how high the fruit is hanging to make all these suggestions.

03:09:57.580 --> 03:10:00.580
It's a very difficult task for us to do.

03:10:00.580 --> 03:10:07.580
In absence of that, though, we do make very public our business rules and we do know that there are districts out there, not everybody.

03:10:07.580 --> 03:10:11.580
There are a few districts out there that are able to calculate this based on those business rules.

03:10:11.580 --> 03:10:16.580
But I appreciate the suggestion and we'll add it to our list. Thank you.

03:10:16.580 --> 03:10:17.580
Thank you.

03:10:17.580 --> 03:10:21.580
Okay. I will see how much we can fit on one PowerPoint slide.

03:10:21.580 --> 03:10:26.580
Yes, member Ortiz-Lacon and member Burr and member Strauss.

03:10:26.580 --> 03:10:27.580
Okay, great.

03:10:27.580 --> 03:10:33.580
Cindy, I just wanted to clarify one thing about the college and career readiness indicator.

03:10:33.580 --> 03:10:35.580
We did vote on that.

03:10:35.580 --> 03:10:43.580
It was something that we voted under the previous board, but I remember taking that vote where we did say it was and.

03:10:43.580 --> 03:10:50.580
My question is around the student growth model, since I will miss the fun as you're all engaging in those discussions.

03:10:50.580 --> 03:10:59.580
And I know that we are not using or we're not controlling for student demographics as many other districts have done, and I believe the core districts also do.

03:10:59.580 --> 03:11:03.580
But we are reporting by student populations or student subgroup, correct?

03:11:03.580 --> 03:11:04.580
Correct.

03:11:04.580 --> 03:11:15.580
So I would want to encourage us that when we're looking at our English learners, that we do disaggregate, that we don't have to take the same definition that we've used under the academic indicator.

03:11:15.580 --> 03:11:35.580
Since the student growth model is really matched scores and looking at that student against that student's performance a year before, that we look at an exclusive English learner progress or growth and also for our reclassified students because we want to make sure that we're able to see are they actually growing post reclassification.

03:11:35.580 --> 03:11:46.580
So to my fellow board members, I would highly encourage you to look at a specific L2L RFIP to RFIP and not cluster our students.

03:11:46.580 --> 03:11:53.580
Thank you.

03:11:53.580 --> 03:11:55.580
OK.

03:11:55.580 --> 03:11:57.580
Thank you.

03:11:57.580 --> 03:12:00.580
First, Cindy, as always, I just want to say thank you.

03:12:00.580 --> 03:12:05.580
The scope of work is kind of mind blowing and we keep adding to it.

03:12:05.580 --> 03:12:18.580
So I really appreciate you sharing with it just to also sort of rewind the tape for a little bit to say once again that this shows how we model continuous improvement from the very beginning of the creation of the accountability system.

03:12:18.580 --> 03:12:20.580
We said don't have all the answers.

03:12:20.580 --> 03:12:24.580
We're going to have to revisit this all the time and adjust accordingly.

03:12:24.580 --> 03:12:28.580
So I just appreciate how how much you keep that at the core of your work.

03:12:28.580 --> 03:12:32.580
I also want to talk about the student growth model for just a second.

03:12:32.580 --> 03:12:34.580
And I appreciate your comments, Felisa.

03:12:34.580 --> 03:12:36.580
I think that's very important.

03:12:36.580 --> 03:12:45.580
But I do think that what I want to reinforce is that I feel like that people have different uses for growth models.

03:12:45.580 --> 03:12:57.580
And so I think as we continue to work on this and I know when we talked about the residual gain model before, it was kind of eye rolling because it was very difficult and technical and hard to understand.

03:12:57.580 --> 03:13:12.580
But I get that that's and I appreciate the expertise of the technical design group to say that's the kind of model we need to use at the state level if we're going to use it to identify LEAs for particular help differentiated assistance.

03:13:12.580 --> 03:13:18.580
But I think that there are a lot of other people out there who have different ideas about what a growth model is.

03:13:18.580 --> 03:13:23.580
And at the simplest form, it's to say the same kind of thing I think that Felisa was discussing.

03:13:23.580 --> 03:13:25.580
How are our kids progressing?

03:13:25.580 --> 03:13:33.580
And if I'm a parent, do I have a piece of information that says to me, yes, this student is growing and they're growing, especially at transitional points.

03:13:33.580 --> 03:13:45.580
And that's what I want to emphasize, that when they move from elementary school to middle school, when they move from middle school to high school, that they're prepared to do the work, that they are at grade level.

03:13:45.580 --> 03:13:50.580
And I'm not sure that what we're going to get will yield that information.

03:13:50.580 --> 03:13:59.580
So I think we need to be careful about what other ways can we communicate that and we'll hear some of this tomorrow on just preview when we talk about charter renewals.

03:13:59.580 --> 03:14:04.580
This happens a lot with charter schools because their grade configurations are different.

03:14:04.580 --> 03:14:07.580
They're getting students from a lot of other schools.

03:14:07.580 --> 03:14:16.580
And in many cases, those students are way below grade level and they're not rewarded for showing the growth given the model that we have now.

03:14:16.580 --> 03:14:31.580
So I just want us to be aware of all of those issues and be crystal clear about what a growth model will be used for, both at the state level and how we will communicate effectively student level growth, both to parents and to LEAs.

03:14:35.580 --> 03:14:44.580
Thank you for the feedback. We haven't noted. I have staff in the audience taking good notes, too. We'll be working on this directly.

03:14:44.580 --> 03:14:53.580
So just to follow up, since Member Burr and I are the liaison to accountability, we've been involved a lot in the continued feedback and support.

03:14:53.580 --> 03:15:04.580
I just want to thank, again, Cindy and the team along with Member Burr about how diligent and how focused you are on trying to get this right and continue to work on it.

03:15:04.580 --> 03:15:09.580
So with that, I'm glad that we're moving along in the student growth model.

03:15:09.580 --> 03:15:14.580
I think the communications are going to be really, really important going forward and the stakeholder input.

03:15:14.580 --> 03:15:21.580
There is some confusion. We have some continuity in some of the letters that we received about some of the concerns and some of the recommendations.

03:15:21.580 --> 03:15:30.580
So I just want to ensure that we have a broad level of stakeholder engagement and that our communications that we just work really hard to try to be clear as we move forward.

03:15:31.580 --> 03:15:37.580
The other thing I appreciated is your discussion about looking at stability of state indicators.

03:15:37.580 --> 03:15:46.580
Because I think we've known we've had to reset some cut scores. We know we've tried to look at small schools, but I think the methodology and the stability is really important.

03:15:46.580 --> 03:15:56.580
And hearing from stakeholders and then working with the technical design group, I think, is going to be really essential as we keep trying to continually improve and get this right.

03:15:56.580 --> 03:16:05.580
And then I think with the English learner indicator, and we've talked a lot about that, we are we had already committed to revisiting that.

03:16:05.580 --> 03:16:10.580
And I think your timeline is June, I believe, and I haven't gotten there yet.

03:16:13.580 --> 03:16:18.580
We took a pause for clarifying questions, so we haven't gotten to all of that yet.

03:16:18.580 --> 03:16:23.580
All right. So I have a few more comments and I'll wait till the rest of your slides.

03:16:23.580 --> 03:16:34.580
Thank you. Just procedurally, Cindy invited us to take a moment and give clarifying questions on that part, but we haven't finished the item yet.

03:16:34.580 --> 03:16:41.580
And so if you have questions on the other parts of the item, let's please hold those. You have a clarifying question on this part of the item.

03:16:41.580 --> 03:16:54.580
So going back to the point that board member Burr made concerning the residual gain model, I agree with her that stakeholders have different goals or purposes for the use of a student growth model.

03:16:54.580 --> 03:17:01.580
I need to say I'm actually not able to ready to vote on that part of we're not voting today.

03:17:01.580 --> 03:17:14.580
Oh, OK, good, because I'm not sure we have a clear consensus as a board on what we're trying to do with the model, because I've heard several different points or goals for the purposes.

03:17:14.580 --> 03:17:20.580
And none of that would be addressed or given to us with a residual gain model.

03:17:20.580 --> 03:17:32.580
So but what I will say is this conversation has now made me appreciate my seventh grade Algebra one teacher because I understand the slope intercept formula much better right now as a result.

03:17:32.580 --> 03:17:34.580
But yes, I'm very concerned about that.

03:17:34.580 --> 03:17:47.580
And I think maybe there needs to be some time for us to talk about what we the last time we had this discussion, we had a different board president and he said that he wasn't ready for that conversation.

03:17:47.580 --> 03:17:51.580
So I'm no more ready now than I was a year and a half ago for this.

03:17:51.580 --> 03:18:03.580
And so I'm hoping we will take some time to be very deliberative and thoughtful not only about the model, but what we have as a consensus about what the model is supposed to do for us.

03:18:03.580 --> 03:18:06.580
I think that's very important.

03:18:06.580 --> 03:18:17.580
We've not yet gotten to public comment because we stopped for clarifying questions, but I think we're deep into the, you know, many issues in the item.

03:18:17.580 --> 03:18:33.580
And there was, by the way, a paper from the CDE in February, which is linked here, which does get into some of those questions about what could a growth model be used for of this kind and what could it not be used for.

03:18:33.580 --> 03:18:50.580
So I would like to allow Cindy to continue the item, but also ask you whether when we complete the item, do you want to get into that discussion today or did you want to come back around the deeper discussion of the growth model next time?

03:18:50.580 --> 03:18:52.580
What was your plan about that?

03:18:52.580 --> 03:18:56.580
I would prefer to come back.

03:18:56.580 --> 03:19:01.580
So I think we can put a pin in that and say it's going to need serious discussion.

03:19:01.580 --> 03:19:05.580
We'll put time for that on the May agenda probably.

03:19:05.580 --> 03:19:06.580
Okay.

03:19:06.580 --> 03:19:07.580
Great.

03:19:07.580 --> 03:19:11.580
So if you want to continue with the other part of the item.

03:19:11.580 --> 03:19:23.580
So I'm going to move to attachment two, and these are revisions can under consideration for the 2020 English on our progress indicator, which of course this year will have a color again, which is very exciting.

03:19:23.580 --> 03:19:31.580
We brought this in as a separate attachment because there was a lot of questions that were brought up in the January meeting when we did not have an item.

03:19:31.580 --> 03:19:36.580
And so we wanted to make sure to have this as a standalone conversation within within the item.

03:19:36.580 --> 03:19:43.580
So just as a reminder, and I think we we tried to outlay this in the in the agenda item that you see before you today.

03:19:44.580 --> 03:19:51.580
The board adopted the cut scores, of course, last November based on the same methodology that we used for every other indicator.

03:19:51.580 --> 03:19:53.580
So status cut scores for every other indicator.

03:19:53.580 --> 03:19:59.580
And that methodology was originally adopted by you and some of you in May of 2016.

03:19:59.580 --> 03:20:08.580
So what the process that we do is in determining cut scores is we look at data from all local educational agencies.

03:20:09.580 --> 03:20:14.580
We and in charter schools, of course, because they're considered local educational agencies under LCFF.

03:20:14.580 --> 03:20:18.580
We rank the results from highest to lowest, and then we set the cut points.

03:20:18.580 --> 03:20:22.580
And this process is described on page 18 of this technical manual.

03:20:22.580 --> 03:20:28.580
The technical manual is actually two hundred and seventy two pages if you want to read it at any point in time.

03:20:28.580 --> 03:20:32.580
But page two hundred and twelve actually shows you the distribution.

03:20:32.580 --> 03:20:35.580
So I know that was a question that was asked that like, where do we find this information?

03:20:35.580 --> 03:20:43.580
And so I wanted to make sure that we included some of this really background information that sometimes we don't get into this kind of detail with you.

03:20:43.580 --> 03:20:48.580
But that you have it if you get asked about it or you want to talk through how this was said.

03:20:48.580 --> 03:20:53.580
Now, keep in mind, when we made the recommendations back in November, we make recommendations for cut scores.

03:20:53.580 --> 03:20:58.580
We don't actually then go and say, based on this, how many districts are going to be in differentiated assistance?

03:20:59.580 --> 03:21:03.580
That's not something that is appropriate when we work with accountability systems.

03:21:03.580 --> 03:21:06.580
We want to make sure that each measure is treated the same.

03:21:06.580 --> 03:21:09.580
And so there's been some questions about distribution.

03:21:09.580 --> 03:21:14.580
So let me talk through what the distribution was for the status.

03:21:14.580 --> 03:21:19.580
And then I want to show you the same information for the college indicator just to give you a comparison.

03:21:19.580 --> 03:21:25.580
So, again, looking at this from like a bell curve, we have the very low end, a little bit less than 10 percent.

03:21:25.580 --> 03:21:30.580
We're in the very low for LEAs and on the high end, about six point five percent.

03:21:30.580 --> 03:21:36.580
We're in the very high majority of our LEAs fall into the middle at forty one point eight percent.

03:21:36.580 --> 03:21:38.580
And this is based on matched data. Right.

03:21:38.580 --> 03:21:45.580
So we looked at any English learner that had an LPAC result from current year and prior year.

03:21:45.580 --> 03:21:50.580
So that was about eight hundred and forty four thousand students for the college indicator.

03:21:50.580 --> 03:21:59.580
So, again, using that same methodology, we look at the very low just under 10 percent at nine point five and the very high at nine percent with the majority in the middle at thirty eight percent.

03:21:59.580 --> 03:22:05.580
So within a couple of percentage points of what we did for the college career indicator.

03:22:05.580 --> 03:22:08.580
So based on this information, I just wanted to walk through.

03:22:08.580 --> 03:22:12.580
I don't actually have a slide on this, but there was information in some of the letters.

03:22:12.580 --> 03:22:18.580
So I wanted to make sure I said this when we when we actually ran the numbers and did differentiate assistance.

03:22:18.580 --> 03:22:25.580
In my mind, for differentiated assistance, you need to be have the same student group in in two different priority areas.

03:22:25.580 --> 03:22:32.580
And for English, the English learner progress indicator, you also are using English language arts and mathematics in that same indicator.

03:22:32.580 --> 03:22:41.580
So you have to find something else outside of those three indicators to determine whether or not a district would be eligible for differentiated assistance.

03:22:41.580 --> 03:22:48.580
So when we look at the data for our English learner subgroup, of course, the English learner progress indicator only encompasses one subgroup, English learners.

03:22:48.580 --> 03:22:56.580
We had thirty seven LEAs and county offices of education and very low and eighty one charters and very low for a hundred of total of one hundred and eighteen.

03:22:56.580 --> 03:23:02.580
Based on that hundred and eighteen, we like to cross other indicators in different priority areas.

03:23:02.580 --> 03:23:07.580
Fifty seven districts were identified for differentiated assistance for their English learners student group.

03:23:07.580 --> 03:23:10.580
That represents about one hundred thousand of our English learners.

03:23:10.580 --> 03:23:16.580
So just over 10 percent of our English learners and includes districts such as San Juan, Vallejo, Lompoc, Santa Maria.

03:23:16.580 --> 03:23:19.580
And I wasn't picking on Lompoc, but it came up this morning.

03:23:19.580 --> 03:23:25.580
So I thought I saw it. Oakland, Delano, Laco, San Diego County Office of Education.

03:23:25.580 --> 03:23:30.580
So it represents a broad scope of districts out there.

03:23:31.580 --> 03:23:40.580
I think the other thing to keep under consideration is because we were denied the waiver by the U.S. Department of Education for being able to include our reclassified students,

03:23:40.580 --> 03:23:47.580
we lost out on one hundred and eighty three thousand students in the indicator as opposed to 2017.

03:23:47.580 --> 03:23:55.580
So that is a consideration that we cannot compare what we're doing now to what we did in 2017 because of because of the RFEP issue.

03:23:55.580 --> 03:23:58.580
So I just wanted to give that sort of perspective.

03:23:58.580 --> 03:24:04.580
And this work was done in conjunction, obviously, with with Jenny Singh's staff, but under the leadership of Jonathan.

03:24:04.580 --> 03:24:09.580
So they did they did a lot of iterations because of the consternation we heard in the field.

03:24:09.580 --> 03:24:16.580
Sure. So we had we looked at the data between 2018 and 2019 to see how many students have been reclassified.

03:24:16.580 --> 03:24:20.580
And it was one hundred and eighty three thousand four hundred and sixty students.

03:24:20.580 --> 03:24:28.580
So remember, our waiver would have included them not only in the in the denominator, but in both both parts of the equation.

03:24:28.580 --> 03:24:39.580
So so where that would have helped demonstrate progress for some, this doesn't allow you to demonstrate progress because they're excluded from the calculation.

03:24:39.580 --> 03:24:45.580
So with that, we will spend this year looking at well, first of all,

03:24:45.580 --> 03:24:50.580
we're spending time now help working with our assessments division to make sure that our students are being tested.

03:24:50.580 --> 03:24:55.580
It's very important that students get access to this test and test.

03:24:55.580 --> 03:25:04.580
And of course, now that we're computer based, we don't have the concerns about lost tests and some of the other issues that have come up over the last several years.

03:25:04.580 --> 03:25:16.580
So we're very hopeful that we'll have a very good data set for this this year moving forward so we can match those match those data sets between the two years or rather three years.

03:25:16.580 --> 03:25:22.580
So with this third year of data that we'll receive, actually in the next slide, it gives you all the specific dates.

03:25:23.580 --> 03:25:36.580
We'll rerun not only we'll look at change, but we'll also look at making sure that that the status cut scores are still they still fall in that bill curve that we we use for our methodology.

03:25:36.580 --> 03:25:45.580
We will be bringing forward this information to not only a technical design group, but of course, we've had this long standing English under progress work group and also to other stakeholders.

03:25:45.580 --> 03:25:50.580
We do convene a local patrol funding formula stakeholder group and then CPAC meets as well.

03:25:50.580 --> 03:25:56.580
But here's the full complement by month of what we're doing around this work plan.

03:25:56.580 --> 03:26:00.580
Actually, the first month I just was notified this morning that this meeting was canceled.

03:26:00.580 --> 03:26:03.580
That takes place next week, the regional assessment meeting.

03:26:03.580 --> 03:26:08.580
I don't know about Kabe, but we do have two sessions planned to talk through the English progress indicator there.

03:26:08.580 --> 03:26:14.580
And one of them is actually a joint presentation with San Diego County Office of Education and Sacramento County Office of Education.

03:26:14.580 --> 03:26:17.580
So we've got a lot of activities around rolling this out.

03:26:17.580 --> 03:26:20.580
We want to make sure the field understands what is being done.

03:26:20.580 --> 03:26:31.580
We know that change will bring a lot of information forward and we'll see we'll likely see districts that are in the red more so than we saw on the very low just because they need to show progress.

03:26:31.580 --> 03:26:34.580
So that is the information for the LP.

03:26:35.580 --> 03:26:41.580
And with that, I have two more slides and then if it's OK with you.

03:26:41.580 --> 03:26:47.580
OK, is that we have been busy since we last saw you in November.

03:26:47.580 --> 03:26:50.580
We've had a lot of presentations.

03:26:50.580 --> 03:26:52.580
We've been traveling a lot and doing webinars.

03:26:52.580 --> 03:26:54.580
So these are our latest statistics.

03:26:54.580 --> 03:26:57.580
And this is the recommendation.

03:26:57.580 --> 03:27:03.580
And just as an aside, we did have an article recently from Kentucky that they were looking at our methodology.

03:27:03.580 --> 03:27:08.580
So I thought you should be aware that our methodology is potentially being used by other states.

03:27:08.580 --> 03:27:12.580
So I'm happy to open up to questions.

03:27:17.580 --> 03:27:18.580
Public comments.

03:27:18.580 --> 03:27:23.580
So I do want to limit us to clarifying questions and then we'll take public comment.

03:27:23.580 --> 03:27:29.580
And then if we need to dive in deeper, we'll decide whether we're going to do that before or after lunch.

03:27:30.580 --> 03:27:34.580
Because we'll see where we are timewise.

03:27:34.580 --> 03:27:37.580
So are there clarifying questions?

03:27:37.580 --> 03:27:39.580
And I do have one myself.

03:27:39.580 --> 03:27:49.580
You were saying earlier that previously we were including RFEPs in our calculation of English learner progress and now we're not.

03:27:49.580 --> 03:27:53.580
I just wanted you to explain that a little bit further.

03:27:53.580 --> 03:28:01.580
So when we moved forward with getting our Every Student Succeeds Act state plan adopted,

03:28:01.580 --> 03:28:05.580
one of the things that we had included there was our calculation of the English learner progress indicator,

03:28:05.580 --> 03:28:08.580
which gave credit towards students who had been reclassified.

03:28:08.580 --> 03:28:12.580
During our negotiations with the U.S. Department of Education and Karen and I,

03:28:12.580 --> 03:28:21.580
we're the executive director of your state board, was there in person with myself and others to explain why it was important to include that student group.

03:28:21.580 --> 03:28:25.580
And ultimately we went forward with an administrative hearing on this waiver.

03:28:25.580 --> 03:28:33.580
That waiver, they determined we needed to submit a waiver to allow us to include students outside the English learner student group.

03:28:33.580 --> 03:28:35.580
And that waiver was ultimately denied.

03:28:35.580 --> 03:28:41.580
So in bringing this back and recalculating our English learner progress indicator using this new assessment,

03:28:41.580 --> 03:28:46.580
we were not allowed to use our reclassified students in that calculation.

03:28:46.580 --> 03:28:55.580
And in the SSA law itself, it allows students who are English learners to be part of that group for a number of years.

03:28:55.580 --> 03:28:57.580
That's only for the academic indicator.

03:28:57.580 --> 03:29:00.580
So that's only for English language arts and math.

03:29:00.580 --> 03:29:02.580
And that is not the case for the same.

03:29:02.580 --> 03:29:03.580
That is not the case.

03:29:03.580 --> 03:29:09.580
And in fact, in trying to apply some of the same criteria, that was why the waiver was required.

03:29:09.580 --> 03:29:15.580
And that's why our data are not comparable.

03:29:15.580 --> 03:29:18.580
Clarifying questions before we go to public comment.

03:29:18.580 --> 03:29:19.580
Clarifying questions.

03:29:19.580 --> 03:29:24.580
I know she's thinking, can I slip this in?

03:29:24.580 --> 03:29:25.580
All right.

03:29:25.580 --> 03:29:26.580
I do want to get to public comment.

03:29:26.580 --> 03:29:29.580
I think we do have some folks waiting for that.

03:29:29.580 --> 03:29:32.580
So let's get to public comment.

03:29:33.580 --> 03:29:36.580
Will the following individuals please line up at the podium?

03:29:36.580 --> 03:29:47.580
Martha Zaragoza-Diaz, Jessica Sacco, Savannah Campbell, Mary Perry, Brian Rebus.

03:29:47.580 --> 03:29:48.580
Good afternoon.

03:29:48.580 --> 03:29:55.580
Martha Zaragoza-Diaz, and I'm representing the California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

03:29:55.580 --> 03:30:00.580
I appreciate the information provided by Cindy with regards to the LP.

03:30:00.580 --> 03:30:12.580
However, we still have major concerns about the cut scores and the state setting very low standards for the expectation for schools and districts on the progress of English language development over time.

03:30:12.580 --> 03:30:27.580
Based upon our review and the available LP data files, 99% of California's English learners are enrolled in districts that are not flagged for needing attention to help students progress in learning English.

03:30:27.580 --> 03:30:46.580
It is strongly recommended that CDE and the State Board convene a stakeholder group and LP committee meeting no later than June 2020 to review the cut scores, the methodology for determining these cut scores, and to provide recommendations on how to adjust the cut scores for the LP performance.

03:30:46.580 --> 03:30:54.580
We look forward to the opportunity to revisit the academic indicator for English learners when discussing the growth model.

03:30:54.580 --> 03:30:59.580
Thank you.

03:30:59.580 --> 03:31:02.580
Good afternoon, Jessica Sacco with Children Now.

03:31:02.580 --> 03:31:11.580
I am here to say thank you to the CDE staff who shared with us the planned timeline for including CAST on the dashboard.

03:31:11.580 --> 03:31:12.580
We're really grateful for that information.

03:31:12.580 --> 03:31:15.580
I know the field will be excited to receive it as well.

03:31:15.580 --> 03:31:33.580
In regards to the growth model, we are also very excited after this many years of working towards a growth model to be here today and really appreciate the members' comments as well as the staff's concern about really having a clear communications plan for how this is going to be received by the field and utilized by the field.

03:31:33.580 --> 03:31:51.580
We would like to suggest that you consider reporting out on multiple years of data since you have multiple years of data about which you can report when you do report out on the growth model, including providing student level information, as well as encouraging staff to consider how a high school level growth model might be incorporated.

03:31:51.580 --> 03:31:56.580
We also support the decision to not adjust for demographics.

03:31:56.580 --> 03:32:02.580
In terms of indicator stability, we are interested in engaging those conversations as we recognize the challenges that this presents.

03:32:02.580 --> 03:32:07.580
Thank you.

03:32:07.580 --> 03:32:08.580
Good afternoon.

03:32:08.580 --> 03:32:19.580
I'm Mary Perry with California State PTA, and I have to echo the comments about what an encouraging process of continuous improvement this work on the dashboard has been.

03:32:19.580 --> 03:32:30.580
We work really hard to inform parents that this dashboard is for their information, and the fact is that's a long haul, and there are always kindergarten parents.

03:32:30.580 --> 03:32:42.580
So that kind of awareness is an ongoing piece of work for our organization in addition to the awareness about NGSS specifically.

03:32:42.580 --> 03:32:52.580
And what we know is that parents really care about science education and really don't know that there are new standards and that implementation is slow.

03:32:52.580 --> 03:33:03.580
And part of what the assessment system in the dashboard can do is to raise the awareness for parents about that implementation and about the new standards.

03:33:03.580 --> 03:33:13.580
So we really are encouraged with any efforts that this board can take to elevate the visibility of those assessment measures, including the dashboard.

03:33:13.580 --> 03:33:18.580
Thank you.

03:33:18.580 --> 03:33:21.580
Hi there. Good afternoon, President and members.

03:33:21.580 --> 03:33:22.580
My name is Savannah Campbell.

03:33:22.580 --> 03:33:30.580
I'm here on behalf of Ed Voice, and we would just like to express our strong support for making a growth model a top priority on this year's dashboard.

03:33:30.580 --> 03:33:34.580
I think Governor Newsom said it best when he said, can't manage what you don't measure.

03:33:34.580 --> 03:33:42.580
And as a former district teacher here in California, I can't think of anything that's more important to measure than how much our students learn and grow.

03:33:42.580 --> 03:33:46.580
I would echo comments have already been made about subgroup work.

03:33:46.580 --> 03:33:53.580
And I think what Children Now has said about reporting multiple years of data, I think stakeholders would like to see this over time.

03:33:53.580 --> 03:33:57.580
And as a high school teacher, I think I'd love to see this data at a high school level too.

03:33:57.580 --> 03:34:00.580
There's plenty of LEAs that already do that with their growth data.

03:34:00.580 --> 03:34:06.580
They have that eighth to 11th grade transition year or transition time, I think would be important to see.

03:34:06.580 --> 03:34:20.580
And just echoing the student level reports would be key, you know, with privacy laws and all that considered for teachers to see with those beginning year rosters for parents to see and holistically understand their students' academic time.

03:34:21.580 --> 03:34:22.580
So thank you very much.

03:34:29.580 --> 03:34:33.580
Madam President, I'm Brian Revis speaking on behalf of the Education Trust West.

03:34:33.580 --> 03:34:41.580
First, we want to say congratulations to member Ortiz Lee Cohen, sort of, but we're going to miss you.

03:34:41.580 --> 03:34:44.580
You've been an amazing equity champion and we're sorry to see you go.

03:34:44.580 --> 03:34:49.580
With regard to the college and career readiness indicator, I wanted to share.

03:34:49.580 --> 03:34:56.580
We're not ready to ask you to adopt FAFSA completion, but I wanted to share that's something that we're looking at.

03:34:56.580 --> 03:34:59.580
That's the free application for financial student assistance.

03:34:59.580 --> 03:35:04.580
We think it's a powerful step in measuring whether or not someone's ready to go on to college.

03:35:04.580 --> 03:35:09.580
We have some unanswered questions of our own, but something we're looking at you might want to consider.

03:35:09.580 --> 03:35:16.580
And then lastly, please continue and consider expediting the work on the growth measure.

03:35:16.580 --> 03:35:20.580
We think it's one of the most important things you can do as a matter of a course correction.

03:35:20.580 --> 03:35:22.580
Very important for equity.

03:35:22.580 --> 03:35:26.580
Tells us whether learning is happening at an accelerated rate.

03:35:26.580 --> 03:35:28.580
That's what we need to close gaps.

03:35:28.580 --> 03:35:29.580
So thank you.

03:35:34.580 --> 03:35:35.580
Good afternoon.

03:35:35.580 --> 03:35:36.580
Sarah Lillis with Teach Plus.

03:35:36.580 --> 03:35:45.580
And first, we wanted to thank Cindy and her team for acknowledging, for working with us on the priority one issue and making sure we can use the data that we have in the new CalSAS system

03:35:45.580 --> 03:35:48.580
about looking about teacher assignment and distributions.

03:35:48.580 --> 03:35:54.580
And we think that's a really important conversation and look forward to participating in that and appreciate their willingness to work with us on that.

03:35:54.580 --> 03:36:00.580
And again, just sort of reiterating at the danger of reiterating too much.

03:36:00.580 --> 03:36:03.580
We are very supportive, really excited to see growth.

03:36:03.580 --> 03:36:08.580
We're on the cusp of really implementing a growth models part of our dashboard.

03:36:09.580 --> 03:36:19.580
And so, again, reiterate the need for communication, being very clear about communication, about what it is, how it should be used to parents, to families, to teachers, and to community members.

03:36:19.580 --> 03:36:23.580
But also, again, sort of exploring what it means.

03:36:23.580 --> 03:36:31.580
And I think, like our colleagues, want to look at whether or not we can include it at the high school level, particularly as it relates.

03:36:31.580 --> 03:36:35.580
I know there's a lot of conversation about the growth model in English learners.

03:36:35.580 --> 03:36:42.580
We have teachers who are struggling with how the dashboard, how the dashboard is being interpreted for English learners at the high school level.

03:36:42.580 --> 03:36:45.580
And so sort of really exploring both the growth model and that.

03:36:48.580 --> 03:36:53.580
Hi, good afternoon. I'm Erin Napdy from Public Advocates, testifying today on behalf of the Equity Coalition.

03:36:53.580 --> 03:36:56.580
And these matters are also spread out more fully in the coalition's letter.

03:36:57.580 --> 03:37:05.580
We also strongly agree with the comments submitted by our coalition partners in supporting the incorporation of the growth model into our accountability system, like so many other states have done.

03:37:05.580 --> 03:37:17.580
And we'd like to thank the board and CDE staff for ensuring strong stakeholder engagement in this process and ask that continued engagement and communication with stakeholders be a primary focus as the growth model is rolled out.

03:37:17.580 --> 03:37:23.580
The whole purpose, as you know, the growth model is to make it meaningful for stakeholders on the ground to assess improvement over time.

03:37:23.580 --> 03:37:30.580
And given its complicated nature, ensuring that stakeholders understand the model is really necessary for it to be an effective tool.

03:37:30.580 --> 03:37:44.580
Respectfully, we're also concerned that the state board may not be doing enough to meet its obligations under the Federal Equal Education Opportunity Act to improve, excuse me, to identify and to improve LEAs whose English learners are underperforming and who are improving too slowly.

03:37:44.580 --> 03:37:57.580
The Equity Coalition urges the board to take another look at the LP cut scores and to make certain that they're set at an appropriate level to ensure the LEAs are making reasonable progress with their English learner English proficiency and where not the time.

03:37:57.580 --> 03:38:14.580
Good afternoon, board members, John Afle from Public Advocates, member Ortiz Lacone, thank you for your service.

03:38:14.580 --> 03:38:18.580
We're going to miss you.

03:38:18.580 --> 03:38:45.580
We were surprised to see that the work on the indicator, priority one indicator, local indicator, setting objective criteria by January 2021 was not included in the staff work plan that went to the board that was set in a trailer bill last year, but very pleased to see the staff

03:38:45.580 --> 03:39:01.580
acknowledge that that is important work to be done this year and they have reached out to us and we will be having a conversation and looking forward to making that work.

03:39:01.580 --> 03:39:20.580
Data, we know that teachers are the single most important school level factor for time achievement and we really do need to be setting objective criteria for improving in that area, thanks.

03:39:20.580 --> 03:39:23.580
That's it for public comments.

03:39:23.580 --> 03:39:45.580
All right, so we can take a little more time to dive into issues and I know member Ortiz Lacone is waiting to dive in and I think member Strauss and member Pagalanan and member Rucker and you were raising your hand, but I think you were pointing, okay, anyone else?

03:39:45.580 --> 03:39:58.580
Okay, I know that all of us received a lot of letters and we've heard from the public regarding the thresholds for the LP and I also know that we did follow the same methodology that we've used with other indicators.

03:39:58.580 --> 03:40:08.580
One thing that was important in the past was making sure that those thresholds were based on real data, that we weren't setting something that was aspirational but perhaps not achievable.

03:40:08.580 --> 03:40:27.580
However, I think we should probably think about our methodology because when we have the number of sites or LEAs that were identified with none or few in LA County, Orange County and Imperial County, which are the highest concentration of English learners,

03:40:27.580 --> 03:40:42.580
to have no district or one district identified, then we should probably revisit our methodology to see if it's still an appropriate one for this indicator that it's quite different than the others, right, because we're measuring for progress.

03:40:42.580 --> 03:40:51.580
Now we're waiting for a third year of data to give the color in the dashboard and I think that we will see a lot more red.

03:40:51.580 --> 03:40:55.580
I don't know that districts will necessarily be ready for that reality as well.

03:40:55.580 --> 03:41:14.580
You know, I was talking to an administrator who said when accountability was under Title III with the AMAOs, people, it was in the big money, right, now it's in Title I, but people were really laser focused on making sure that they were meeting those AMAOs and that she hasn't seen that sense of urgency since we moved to the LP.

03:41:14.580 --> 03:41:22.580
We all thought we would see it, right, that there was a reason why move from Title III to Title I under the ESSA.

03:41:22.580 --> 03:41:36.580
So I think that either people won't be ready to see that red indicator because very low doesn't translate to red in their minds, or they're going to really struggle to try to meet the needs of students once they get to that level.

03:41:36.580 --> 03:42:05.580
I know that the memo alluded to maybe more sites being identified once we have the status and change, but I'm also wondering what that will mean if we move from a five by five to a three by five, because do we know, do we have a sense of what it would mean, any projections, how many districts would be identified under the five by five versus the three by five if we move all of our indicators to that same five by five, three by five.

03:42:05.580 --> 03:42:24.580
So I would encourage us to look and see, one, what does it mean if we do have districts that will have that change next year, how many do, or this year, how many do we think we would identify under red, and then what would, can we do some data runs to see what that means under the five by five versus the three by five.

03:42:24.580 --> 03:42:28.580
Thank you.

03:42:28.580 --> 03:42:30.580
I think Member Strauss is next.

03:42:30.580 --> 03:42:37.580
So I just want to talk about two areas to continue my comments, one on EL progress indicator and then the other area of science.

03:42:37.580 --> 03:42:44.580
So I know this is the third year, and then we had agreed that we would revisit the third year once we have the data.

03:42:44.580 --> 03:42:50.580
So I think we do really need to take a look at this indicator again and make sure we're getting it right.

03:42:50.580 --> 03:43:00.580
I really appreciated, Cindy, the LP status distribution, the graph that you had and sort of how the LEAs are laying out, and I think that's something that we should continue to look at.

03:43:00.580 --> 03:43:08.580
I know we have areas of our state that have high concentrations and we should really take a look if we're reflecting correctly student achievement.

03:43:08.580 --> 03:43:18.580
But when you talked about the bilingual coordinators input, and I think that part of the stakeholders, one of the things we know in our state is we have 58 counties.

03:43:18.580 --> 03:43:19.580
We're really big.

03:43:19.580 --> 03:43:30.580
We're trying to get a whole system in place and trying to calibrate, and I think as we work with them, I think what we're realizing, and I think the EL leads met at the end of February.

03:43:30.580 --> 03:43:41.580
I'm not sure if you know what that means, but they met, and they're not all on the same page as far as how they're interpreting, what they're hearing, how it's being communicated out to LEAs.

03:43:41.580 --> 03:43:54.580
So as we build our communication, which we talked about as a real priority, I think it's important once we agree to really try to calibrate the leads in the area of English learners so that the communication across our state is as...

03:43:54.580 --> 03:43:59.580
And I think that's actually true in accountability and LCAP and all the communication.

03:43:59.580 --> 03:44:06.580
But in this area, my understanding was there's some confusion going on with the EL leads, and it's something that we ought to pay attention to.

03:44:06.580 --> 03:44:18.580
My other comment on science is that we've been working on science for a long time, and I think those of us who've been at this a while realize that from the adoption of the standards in 2013 and the framework and the materials,

03:44:18.580 --> 03:44:23.580
that still out in the field today, there are teachers who don't know what our new standards are.

03:44:23.580 --> 03:44:24.580
They have no idea.

03:44:24.580 --> 03:44:28.580
There is not the districts with money and funding the way it is.

03:44:28.580 --> 03:44:33.580
Some districts are thinking about aligned materials for next fall, but more likely it's the year after.

03:44:33.580 --> 03:44:38.580
It's a slow process, and it's a long time in coming.

03:44:38.580 --> 03:44:42.580
So I really want us to continue to stay aware of the science issue.

03:44:42.580 --> 03:44:46.580
But the thing that I've now become aware of is that there...

03:44:46.580 --> 03:44:55.580
And I'd like you to clarify what you know about the fact that we had committed a couple years ago that when we had valid and reliable data, we would look at an indicator for science.

03:44:55.580 --> 03:44:58.580
And now we're hearing from the feds that that may...

03:44:58.580 --> 03:45:03.580
We've been trying to make the California system and the federal system one system, not two systems.

03:45:03.580 --> 03:45:12.580
And now we're hearing that the feds have some concerns about the number of academic and non-academic indicators and what that mean to one single system.

03:45:12.580 --> 03:45:19.580
So I just would like you to clarify a little bit about what we're hearing from the feds, what work we'll have to do on that.

03:45:19.580 --> 03:45:28.580
And because we did make a commitment that we would have a place for science, and yet we're hearing some different communication from the feds.

03:45:28.580 --> 03:45:37.580
Sure. And let me be clear, we haven't directly asked the feds about bringing the Fed's main U.S. Department of Education, bringing the science test on board as a standalone indicator.

03:45:37.580 --> 03:45:41.580
We would definitely have to revisit our state plan.

03:45:41.580 --> 03:45:52.580
And one of the negotiation points that actually Dave set was really instrumental in getting us to a point where they could agree to our state plan was to talk about the balance between non-academic and academic indicators.

03:45:52.580 --> 03:46:01.580
And so as soon as you introduce a new indicator, we now have a potential imbalance for those indicators.

03:46:01.580 --> 03:46:06.580
So we need to start those discussions based on our past experience.

03:46:06.580 --> 03:46:15.580
These things take a long time and they've changed staff tremendously in that place, in the department as a whole.

03:46:15.580 --> 03:46:20.580
And so the folks that we were working with before are no longer in the capacity they were in.

03:46:20.580 --> 03:46:30.580
So I just, you know, unlike the English Learner Progress Indicator, which, of course, has been around and we were able to retool and such, CASA is a whole new ballgame.

03:46:30.580 --> 03:46:43.580
So we need to make sure that we start those conversations, which was what we signaled in the item that we needed to do, to see how we can come up with a balance of indicators that they'll agree to.

03:46:43.580 --> 03:46:54.580
Can I clarify that while we would think of science as an academic indicator, the Department of Education has been ruling that it's not an academic indicator.

03:46:54.580 --> 03:47:00.580
I know. So that's the balance that Cindy is referring to.

03:47:00.580 --> 03:47:05.580
And that could, that interpretation could evolve over time.

03:47:05.580 --> 03:47:08.580
There could be a new ESSA in a year or two.

03:47:08.580 --> 03:47:11.580
Yeah, there are lots of ways in which that might unfold.

03:47:11.580 --> 03:47:18.580
But right now, that would mean we would have to rebalance our other indicators to have a preponderance of weight in the academic indicators.

03:47:18.580 --> 03:47:22.580
And we've tried to make sure that each of our indicators are equally weighted.

03:47:22.580 --> 03:47:24.580
And I think this introduces other potentials.

03:47:24.580 --> 03:47:26.580
And I don't know that you would all want us to go there.

03:47:26.580 --> 03:47:45.580
So we just need to explore our options.

03:47:45.580 --> 03:47:47.580
Perfect. Thank you.

03:47:47.580 --> 03:47:56.580
So I would like to also agree with member Ortiz-Licon because, you know, methodology can kind of seem very concrete in that it's always, it's always correct.

03:47:56.580 --> 03:48:08.580
But it's also important to recognize what's happening in real life when you're seeing the results and just making sure that English learners are really getting the most help needed.

03:48:08.580 --> 03:48:16.580
And I had a question about, I know we were going to say we're going to save the growth model discussion, but I have just one question.

03:48:16.580 --> 03:48:26.580
So not being here before and reading the agenda item, it says that the SB directed the CD to further explore the residual gain model.

03:48:26.580 --> 03:48:32.580
And I was just curious, did that mean that the other models were not at all explored?

03:48:33.580 --> 03:48:41.580
If we are thinking about not necessarily going that route or clarifying where this is going, were those other models also explored?

03:48:41.580 --> 03:48:43.580
They were definitely explored.

03:48:43.580 --> 03:48:54.580
There was there's actually been several several meetings in which these were discussed and where the board landed was residual gain model most aligned to the priorities that the board set out.

03:48:54.580 --> 03:49:01.580
I think the board meetings date back to 2016 on bringing this to that to conversations.

03:49:01.580 --> 03:49:09.580
But it's obvious from the discussion this morning and this afternoon that we'll need to spend a little bit more time talking about what so what what does this mean?

03:49:09.580 --> 03:49:11.580
How is this going to be used?

03:49:11.580 --> 03:49:16.580
And then I have one more one more thing, just kind of a side note.

03:49:16.580 --> 03:49:21.580
But hearing from districts, I think I think it's important.

03:49:21.580 --> 03:49:25.580
There's a lot of amazing things that I think we're reaching towards.

03:49:25.580 --> 03:49:31.580
But I do also think that it's important to look back at exactly what we have that's existing.

03:49:31.580 --> 03:49:37.580
A lot of superintendents and districts are talking about how they still sometimes parents are confused.

03:49:37.580 --> 03:49:39.580
It's still a little complicated.

03:49:39.580 --> 03:49:49.580
And there still is time needed to work on what's already existing maybe before like super extreme measures are taken because, you know,

03:49:49.580 --> 03:49:54.580
everything existing, even though it might seem completely stable, still, you know, need some improvement.

03:49:54.580 --> 03:50:09.580
So find that balance between working on what's already existing and then also, you know, working towards, you know, more drastic improvements.

03:50:09.580 --> 03:50:12.580
But we can come to member son after that.

03:50:12.580 --> 03:50:24.580
So let me begin by saying I'm not going to comment about the science indicator, because if I did, Linda would have to order me to take a seminar.

03:50:24.580 --> 03:50:31.580
So so I am going to talk a little bit about the LP.

03:50:31.580 --> 03:50:37.580
I read with great interest and concern the letters that we received.

03:50:37.580 --> 03:50:47.580
And I took them personally, not because I'm a board member, but because I'm a former classroom teacher.

03:50:47.580 --> 03:50:54.580
And I remember my students who were English learners.

03:50:54.580 --> 03:51:01.580
And if I knew then the things that I'm supposed to understand now in this discussion,

03:51:01.580 --> 03:51:18.580
It should not be hard to figure out whether how we're using the indicator is giving us the information we're supposed to have to identify districts whose students are not performing as we expect.

03:51:18.580 --> 03:51:27.580
So I was shocked. I was amazed. I was aghast at the districts that were not included.

03:51:27.580 --> 03:51:40.580
I was shocked. I was amazed. I was aghast at the number of English learners whose test scores on the LP were not included.

03:51:40.580 --> 03:51:57.580
I was shocked. I was amazed. I was aghast that in a state as large as ours that has as many English learners as we do that not all of them seem to be getting tested and reflected in this data point.

03:51:57.580 --> 03:52:06.580
So I understand that people are still learning something about this work.

03:52:06.580 --> 03:52:19.580
But I'm going to say again, if I as a classroom teacher had this tool to use when I was in the classroom, it would have been so much more helpful to me.

03:52:19.580 --> 03:52:24.580
And it would have helped those students that I taught as a result.

03:52:24.580 --> 03:52:35.580
So the fact that we are not pushing harder to make sure that this data is used and is provided in a way that is useful is of great concern to me.

03:52:35.580 --> 03:52:49.580
I am concerned that we still continue as we are developing and living with the question that we're not we're not developing an answer that moves the conversation forward.

03:52:49.580 --> 03:52:53.580
So it is emotional and it is personal to me.

03:52:53.580 --> 03:53:08.580
And I'm and I'm so sorry to see Board Member LeCone leaving us because I can't be the only one up here that feels this way and that responds this way.

03:53:08.580 --> 03:53:21.580
I'm wondering whether what you're responding to is something that was in the letters that I think Cindy tried to correct some of the data on a few minutes ago.

03:53:21.580 --> 03:53:29.580
So I think that while there's always reason to be concerned about how we're understanding what needs to be done with English learners,

03:53:29.580 --> 03:53:40.580
there are many more districts that are identified for differentiated assistance than were reflected there and many more students were tested than was reflected that data just were not completely accurate.

03:53:41.580 --> 03:53:44.580
Members.

03:53:44.580 --> 03:53:45.580
Thank you.

03:53:45.580 --> 03:53:55.580
And just it's my experiences as an English learner very early on when there was no English learner programs or even identified.

03:53:55.580 --> 03:54:00.580
I appreciate your comments.

03:54:01.580 --> 03:54:12.580
I actually my comments was on back on the growth model and I having heard the conversations again I just want to encourage that maybe we have those conversations sooner than later.

03:54:12.580 --> 03:54:26.580
There are a lot of folks here who are very excited about this growth model and I don't want us to disappoint if we don't have the initial conversations before CDE goes and does their technical work.

03:54:26.580 --> 03:54:29.580
I think we are going to be working against each other.

03:54:29.580 --> 03:54:32.580
So I just encourage us to have that conversation.

03:54:32.580 --> 03:54:46.580
And it is extremely important in the context of looking at some of our students who are not have not been supported properly or not have performed well traditionally.

03:54:46.580 --> 03:54:55.580
And we need to set something up so that we can really assess and support those students moving forward.

03:54:55.580 --> 03:55:00.580
So this is not an item for vote or action.

03:55:00.580 --> 03:55:02.580
It's an item for giving input.

03:55:02.580 --> 03:55:04.580
We have given a lot of input.

03:55:04.580 --> 03:55:08.580
I'm sure that it's been well recorded and well received.

03:55:08.580 --> 03:55:13.580
Just to summarize I think that we're many of us are saying we want to come back.

03:55:13.580 --> 03:55:15.580
We want to talk about the growth model.

03:55:15.580 --> 03:55:23.580
We probably need another conversation on the LP so that we can continue that depth of understanding.

03:55:24.580 --> 03:55:39.580
And then the third one I would add to that is just to the point that there is also to be added to the dashboard the information about teacher qualifications that we ought to bring that back also for more examination.

03:55:39.580 --> 03:55:42.580
I think I've captured the sense of the group.

03:55:42.580 --> 03:55:46.580
And with that it is lunchtime.

03:55:46.580 --> 03:55:50.580
We thank you Cindy for that wonderful presentation and all the work that went into it.

03:55:50.580 --> 03:55:55.580
And we will reconvene at how much time are we allowed to give ourselves for lunch.

03:55:55.580 --> 03:55:59.580
Forty five minutes.

03:55:59.580 --> 03:56:03.580
Yeah, we'll we'll say 115.

03:56:03.580 --> 03:56:14.580
Okay.

03:56:15.580 --> 03:56:22.580
Welcome back.

03:56:22.580 --> 03:56:32.580
We're going to resume our agenda with item six, which is the special education item.

03:56:32.580 --> 03:56:48.580
The CD recommends that the state board approve the SSP prepared by the special education division to be submitted to the US Department of Education Office of Special Education programs by the mandated submission date of April 1, 2020.

03:56:48.580 --> 03:56:52.580
This item will be presented by Kristen right from the CD.

03:56:52.580 --> 03:56:56.580
Kristen, please begin.

03:56:56.580 --> 03:56:58.580
Darling Hammond and members, can you hear me.

03:56:59.580 --> 03:57:01.580
Excellent.

03:57:01.580 --> 03:57:12.580
Before I start this, can I just take one moment to give a special thank you to Nikki Sandoval and to Felisa Ortiz and cone for their incredible service and support around students with disabilities.

03:57:12.580 --> 03:57:27.580
Nikki, thank you for being the liaison all this time your thoughtfulness and humility and brilliance have been so deeply appreciated and will be very much missed on the special education commission and Felisa Thank you.

03:57:27.580 --> 03:57:33.580
Not just on behalf of your support for English learners, but for students with disabilities and students with disabilities who are English learners.

03:57:33.580 --> 03:57:35.580
I know you will all continue to fight.

03:57:35.580 --> 03:57:37.580
So thank you.

03:57:37.580 --> 03:57:45.580
So my name is Kristen right and I am the director of the special education division here at the California Department of Education.

03:57:45.580 --> 03:57:55.580
And I'm here today to ask for your approval so that we can submit this next report of our state systemic improvement plan.

03:57:55.580 --> 03:58:03.580
This is part of a multi-year plan that you've heard about from for a number of years, and that we've been reporting to you on.

03:58:03.580 --> 03:58:10.580
And so we're not.

03:58:10.580 --> 03:58:15.580
We're stuck.

03:58:15.580 --> 03:58:21.580
Chad will help.

03:58:21.580 --> 03:58:22.580
Thank you.

03:58:22.580 --> 03:58:27.580
So just to really quickly recap what the state systemic improvement plan is.

03:58:27.580 --> 03:58:29.580
This is one of our requirements.

03:58:29.580 --> 03:58:33.580
Remember last meeting we worked on the federal indicators one through 16.

03:58:33.580 --> 03:58:40.580
This is indicator 17, which was added much later in the process under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.

03:58:40.580 --> 03:58:45.580
And this is our multi-year plan for improving results for students with disabilities.

03:58:45.580 --> 03:58:56.580
And last month or two months ago, you approved our annual performance report, which was all the data as well as and what was happening with the federal indicators around students with disabilities.

03:58:56.580 --> 03:59:07.580
This is every state's opportunity to do something around improvement in many states did much small took much smaller bites of the apple, if you will.

03:59:08.580 --> 03:59:19.580
They did really specific sort of almost research kind of projects around working with single student groups within the students with disability student group and even focus on specific schools.

03:59:19.580 --> 03:59:26.580
California decided to go big, and it was at a time when we were just rolling out the local control accountability plans.

03:59:26.580 --> 03:59:29.580
We were trying to figure out where special ed fit with all of this.

03:59:29.580 --> 03:59:33.580
The task force report, I think, was just getting ready or just come out.

03:59:34.580 --> 03:59:43.580
And so this was really used as California's big vision and vehicle around how we're going to make sure to help create that one coherent system of education.

03:59:43.580 --> 03:59:46.580
So, you know, the annual performance report consists of those indicators.

03:59:46.580 --> 03:59:48.580
This is indicator 17.

03:59:48.580 --> 03:59:58.580
This process started in 1314, which was actually prior to the task force report and when the LCAP and the accountability system was just kind of getting started.

03:59:58.580 --> 04:00:09.580
And so the purpose was really to achieve coherence and alignment about across state and federal systems to realize one system of education, which we had not coined at that point.

04:00:09.580 --> 04:00:20.580
So the phases that we walked through were now in phase three, which is sort of the final before the final report to basically talk about our progress.

04:00:21.580 --> 04:00:29.580
And I'm happy to report that we've made a considerable amount of progress in the state around the system's coherency, unbelievable progress, in fact.

04:00:29.580 --> 04:00:39.580
And so with local control funding for you kind of being a driver around the conversations, the state systemic improvement plan kind of came up at the same time.

04:00:39.580 --> 04:00:43.580
And it really helped special education become part of those conversations.

04:00:43.580 --> 04:00:44.580
And many of you were there for that.

04:00:44.580 --> 04:00:55.580
So the original theory of action, if you notice, actually talks about the LCAP and that being the vehicle for sort of hopping on the train to get this coherency.

04:00:55.580 --> 04:01:11.580
And so, as you know, because we've used the Pacman charts and shown you a million times over that overlap between student groups, that really that was also another guiding force in really how special ed entered the conversation.

04:01:11.580 --> 04:01:22.580
Understanding that students with disabilities or also students in poverty, they were also English learners and they were also foster youth with one in four foster youth being a student with a disability.

04:01:22.580 --> 04:01:29.580
And altogether of students with disabilities, 70 percent of them being represented in the local control funding formula.

04:01:29.580 --> 04:01:32.580
So really not they're in a separate system.

04:01:32.580 --> 04:01:35.580
They are all part of the same conversation that we're having.

04:01:35.580 --> 04:01:39.580
And you guys have done such a wonderful job at including special education in the conversation.

04:01:40.580 --> 04:01:45.580
So the summary of phase two, the implementation plan.

04:01:45.580 --> 04:01:48.580
Again, our accountability system was in transition.

04:01:48.580 --> 04:01:51.580
Our infrastructure was changing.

04:01:51.580 --> 04:01:56.580
We use this as the vehicle and to that coherent approach.

04:01:56.580 --> 04:02:02.580
And now that we're in phase three, we really want to report out on our progress.

04:02:02.580 --> 04:02:10.580
And so today, this presentation, I'm going to give you a little bit of this so that you can vote appropriately whether you want to send it forward or not.

04:02:10.580 --> 04:02:11.580
Hope you want to do that.

04:02:11.580 --> 04:02:21.580
And then we're going to I'm going to ask Carla Estrada to come up and talk about our unique partnership we have with the CCE around assisting the improvement of students with disabilities.

04:02:21.580 --> 04:02:34.580
And then we've brought a district in one of our technical assistance projects to show you just how this is actually impacting students, which we hear from you often that that's what you'd really like to see.

04:02:34.580 --> 04:02:39.580
So we have made significant progress, as I highlighted before.

04:02:39.580 --> 04:02:46.580
One of the major latest undertakings is around the Selpa leads as part of the state system of support.

04:02:46.580 --> 04:03:02.580
So we really sort of put Selpas in a more of the overarching role, not just for the local parenting role, but really to help build statewide capacity around how do you serve students with disabilities and improve the outcomes for students with disabilities.

04:03:02.580 --> 04:03:05.580
And Carla will talk about them in a few minutes.

04:03:05.580 --> 04:03:24.580
Those are the ones that have been awarded from the past year from the first time the Selpa leads were awarded, and the only time so far, and they are hard at work, creating resources at every level at the foundational level so lots of general resources for the whole, as well as specific

04:03:24.580 --> 04:03:30.580
targeted resources to help Selpa directors work with their districts to provide more support.

04:03:30.580 --> 04:03:54.580
So the special education division as part of our activities and our requirements under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, as many of you know, we receive around $1.4 billion a year in IDEA funds to support the monitoring and improvement and procedural safeguards for students with disabilities.

04:03:54.580 --> 04:04:10.580
And within a little bit of funding that we have at the department for technical assistance, we do contracts and provide services for technical assistance through some of our county offices and other providers that have specialty areas of expertise.

04:04:10.580 --> 04:04:29.580
And there's some that are highlighted here on the slide. And today we have our Supporting Inclusive Practices Project, which is one of our signature projects doing work with districts around system coherency, specifically to increase the outcomes for students with disabilities in their least restrictive environment or closer to general education.

04:04:29.580 --> 04:04:51.580
So we, as a strategic partnership, from the beginning with the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence and my partner in crime here, Carla Estrada, who will be up in a minute, we continue to align our own technical assistance with the needs of the field, whether it be around differentiated assistance or what we're seeing in our own data.

04:04:51.580 --> 04:05:20.580
And so one of those highlighted areas, as you know, that the state could use an additional boost is around access to general education. And so if our theory of action is that great first instruction is the primary driver of student outcomes with a great teacher, that we want to make sure all kids have access to that great first instruction and that special education and our brilliant special educators are able to do their work as well in partnership with general education and not instead of.

04:05:21.580 --> 04:05:36.580
So we asked ourselves as part of our evaluation questions over the years, and this is what we reported on in the report and I won't read through all the questions, but just so you know, we have our own evaluation that we ask of ourselves each year.

04:05:36.580 --> 04:05:50.580
And as part of our ongoing monitoring activities, we're also embarking on an evaluation process we're putting in place to see are the things that we're monitoring for and everything that we're doing in the special ed division is that mapped towards improving student outcomes.

04:05:50.580 --> 04:05:56.580
We're not just doing it for compliance purposes, but we're doing it to have real change.

04:05:56.580 --> 04:06:11.580
So our data that we used because the US Department of Education Office of Special Education programs really wanted states to have specific data points that are directly related to students.

04:06:11.580 --> 04:06:18.580
When you're trying to talk about systems coherency and you're trying to make that tie to student level data, that takes time.

04:06:18.580 --> 04:06:31.580
Right. We did see increases this year as you know, although slight across most of the areas around assessment and are slowly continuing to go up about 1% a year around least restrictive environment.

04:06:31.580 --> 04:06:53.580
But we looked at two of our signature projects. One, our sums our California scale up multi tiered system of support, which you have seen presentations from Orange County and Christine Olmsted about the scale up in California around that, as well as our supporting inclusive practices project that you'll hear about from our folks in a minute.

04:06:53.580 --> 04:07:16.580
But what I wanted to say about those is, is although those are at county offices and they work with us, we work directly with them. We at the Department of Education are responsible for the contracts and grants and working in close collaboration with our partners across the state to make sure that we are all on the same page around being able to scale all these activities.

04:07:16.580 --> 04:07:42.580
One of the things that I also want to highlight, and we've talked about this a little bit in the last couple previous meetings, is really cannot accentuate enough that casemath to CALPADS transition, that eliminating the special ed data system and migrating it into that larger data set, which I think is going to provide us with a lot of rich information over the next few years to really get to root cause analysis for our districts and schools.

04:07:42.580 --> 04:07:54.580
And so one of the things that the Office of Special Education Programs wanted to make sure of is that states are really looking at their own data quality. This allows us to continue to upgrade our data quality.

04:07:54.580 --> 04:08:09.580
So we have the one single data system. We've put a lot more validations in place, and for the data wonky people who like to talk about data validations and data reliability and validity, this is a huge step in the right direction.

04:08:09.580 --> 04:08:21.580
And it really does encourage the relationships at the local level because where does the data come from? It comes from the local districts and schools who now have to talk to each other about their special education and general education data.

04:08:21.580 --> 04:08:32.580
And that has presented some challenges that we've been able to walk through around really getting people together to talk about their data, which has been really exciting.

04:08:32.580 --> 04:08:42.580
So as part of our measurable result that we're asking you to approve and send forward as part of the state systemic improvement plan, we used assessment.

04:08:42.580 --> 04:08:50.580
And you know the data, you were presented to it a number of times, but this is the data that we used to move forward.

04:08:50.580 --> 04:09:01.580
For most of the areas for ELA, we definitely met our targets, although we'd like to see obviously a lot greater improvements for students with disabilities over the next few years.

04:09:01.580 --> 04:09:20.580
And so as we continue this work, we feel like in some ways we've been doing this a long time and in other ways we're in the infancy of this work because our structure has really been now developed where we can start actually, you know, still putting some of the pieces together, but we're really starting to see some movement.

04:09:20.580 --> 04:09:23.580
And I know our folks who are working with the districts will talk about that.

04:09:23.580 --> 04:09:32.580
But we will continue to maximize and get every bit out of this state systemic improvement plan we can to have a seat at the table.

04:09:32.580 --> 04:09:35.580
And I'll tell you that we don't have to ask to be invited anymore.

04:09:35.580 --> 04:09:47.580
We are part of the team and part of the invitation on the automatic, but we are also internally streamlining and integrating our monitoring processes.

04:09:47.580 --> 04:10:02.580
And so you may hear things about a mega letter that came out to all the district superintendents that basically spelled out all of the activities that every district was involved in last year with the special ed division and will be involved in this year.

04:10:02.580 --> 04:10:08.580
And I think we finally landed on a version 33 of the letter.

04:10:08.580 --> 04:10:12.580
Once it got out after it went through a lot of people's lenses.

04:10:12.580 --> 04:10:18.580
I think it was still more than seven pages of information, but it's all in one place.

04:10:18.580 --> 04:10:27.580
And what we've heard in the past is it's so hard to understand what all these different pieces are when we get them at different times and in the mail and in our email.

04:10:27.580 --> 04:10:30.580
So it's all in one place and we'll continue to improve that.

04:10:30.580 --> 04:10:36.580
But just so you know that that's out there and districts have all that information in one place.

04:10:36.580 --> 04:10:48.580
So I am going to transition now into our next set of slides, which are not in this set, apparently.

04:10:48.580 --> 04:10:59.580
Chad, I could use your assistance.

04:10:59.580 --> 04:11:02.580
I'm feeling really old right now.

04:11:02.580 --> 04:11:05.580
That's it. Thank you.

04:11:05.580 --> 04:11:09.580
So I'm going to transition to introduce Carla.

04:11:09.580 --> 04:11:16.580
But but if there are any questions about what I just presented, maybe we can take those now.

04:11:16.580 --> 04:11:20.580
Chair Darling Hammond, clarifying questions.

04:11:20.580 --> 04:11:25.580
Do you want me to clarify the meaning of clarifying?

04:11:26.580 --> 04:11:30.580
Because I want to be sure that we save the big discussion until after public comment.

04:11:30.580 --> 04:11:35.580
But yes, please, clarifying questions now for Kristen.

04:11:35.580 --> 04:11:39.580
All right. OK, we can move on and then we'll we'll come back to you.

04:11:39.580 --> 04:11:50.580
We will have wonderful. So so at the end, what we do need from you is that ability to be able to move it forward so that we can send it on to the U.S. Department of Education.

04:11:50.580 --> 04:12:02.580
So as we are now moving from this big idea, this big dream of having one coherent system of education, we do now have a system of support that has come to birth.

04:12:02.580 --> 04:12:09.580
And we're really excited about the work that we've been doing collaboratively with our county offices of education,

04:12:09.580 --> 04:12:17.580
with the California Collaborative and with the state board around having a shared partnership in trying to increase outcomes for all students,

04:12:17.580 --> 04:12:23.580
but students with disabilities in particular. So I'd like to invite Carla Estrada to come up.

04:12:23.580 --> 04:12:28.580
She's the director of the Systems Improvement and Innovation at the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence.

04:12:28.580 --> 04:12:39.580
And we work very closely together to ensure that we are on the same page and that we're giving consistent messaging to the field and to our partners.

04:12:39.580 --> 04:12:54.580
We serve as sort of co-parents to the self-elites. And and so our have have it's been really nice to be in lockstep and being able to have partners in this work because we know that it's not any one person or entity that can do this alone.

04:12:54.580 --> 04:12:58.580
And I'll hand it off to you, Carla.

04:12:58.580 --> 04:13:01.580
Good afternoon, board members.

04:13:01.580 --> 04:13:12.580
So what I'd love to share with you are some highlights of how we've really within the system of support started to really work together in being able to meet the needs of our students with disabilities.

04:13:12.580 --> 04:13:25.580
I'd like to highlight some examples of where that's actually happening, but also share with you some reflections that we've had so far since we've been able to within the system of support identify these leads and knowing that we need to just keep getting better.

04:13:26.580 --> 04:13:36.580
There's a lot more work to be done. We're fully aware of that. We see that in the data. And so how do we continue to engage in continuous improvement ourselves as a system of support?

04:13:36.580 --> 04:13:53.580
So just as a reminder, the system of support really serves as a resource, a network, if you will, of being a connector of best practices, as well as being facilitators to other counties, as well as other LEAs that are engaged in these kinds of best practices.

04:13:53.580 --> 04:14:05.580
And then also, they're meant to be a resource to ensure that our school districts and our charter schools and other schools are able to receive the type of support that they may need based on their data.

04:14:05.580 --> 04:14:12.580
And so just as a reminder, again, this is really a web of opportunities that we're trying to create throughout the state.

04:14:12.580 --> 04:14:20.580
Also, as a reminder, we have leads that have been identified today. I'm going to focus more on some of the work that the GEO leads have been doing as well as the SELPA leads.

04:14:20.580 --> 04:14:30.580
But we've also had other partnerships, as I will highlight as well, with other leads within the system of support. But just as a reminder, here are who they are and where they exist throughout the state.

04:14:31.580 --> 04:14:39.580
So our geographic leads, their real purpose is to build the capacity of county offices to address issues of inequity.

04:14:39.580 --> 04:14:46.580
Two examples that I think that are important and very focused around students with disabilities are Kern County and Chasta County.

04:14:46.580 --> 04:14:58.580
So Kern County has been partnering with the SELPA system improvement leads to really look at not just the outcomes, but the data that they're using to be able to engage in continuous improvement.

04:14:58.580 --> 04:15:04.580
One thing is you see districts go through cycles of improvement, really trying to understand like a root cause.

04:15:04.580 --> 04:15:09.580
What we're finding is sometimes being able to look at the data from different perspectives.

04:15:09.580 --> 04:15:17.580
For example, state and federal performance indicators, as much as academic performance and so on, requires you to dig deeper and really push yourselves.

04:15:17.580 --> 04:15:26.580
And so the system improvement leads have been hard at work in being a resource to county offices as they engage in these kinds of continuous improvement conversations or

04:15:26.580 --> 04:15:31.580
differentiated assistance. And Kern County is a great example of how they started to do that.

04:15:31.580 --> 04:15:46.580
Another county is Chasta County Office of Education, who's really been partnering with the Placer County SELPA in being able to implement and really build capacity at the local level around universal design for learning.

04:15:46.580 --> 04:15:56.580
And I think this is really important because one of the things that we hear very clearly from our Northern California partners is that they share how hard it is to access some of the resources within the system.

04:15:56.580 --> 04:16:02.580
Because being able to commute and travel and being able to access these things is something that could take multiple days.

04:16:02.580 --> 04:16:07.580
It's not just coming to one day of training. And also they've got to make sure locally they're building that capacity.

04:16:08.580 --> 04:16:24.580
And so the nice thing with the Placer County SELPA is that they've been going out to Chasta and Trinity and other partners to be able to help build local capacity, coach, be a reflective partner where they are rather than expecting folks that come to them for every training.

04:16:24.580 --> 04:16:36.580
And so I think that's something to really pay attention to as we think about some of our communities, especially our LEAs, who really do want to participate in some of our offerings and trainings and things like that, but it's just very difficult to do so.

04:16:36.580 --> 04:16:42.580
So we're looking carefully to see how they build this out and how we can think about that as a larger system.

04:16:42.580 --> 04:16:57.580
So as a reminder around our SELPA leads, their primary roles to build special education, our SELPA's capacity to support LEAs in achieving their goals and actions and services identified in their local control and accountability plans.

04:16:57.580 --> 04:17:02.580
And as again, as Kristen had shared, these are our different leads with different roles.

04:17:02.580 --> 04:17:07.580
So we have the system improvement leads who are focused on data quality and literacy, continuous improvement.

04:17:07.580 --> 04:17:16.580
Meanwhile, our SELPA content leads are focused on English learners, students with disabilities, evidence based practices, especially for children with autism.

04:17:16.580 --> 04:17:24.580
Others are focused on universal design and also thinking about how augmented communication can be used with UDL in mind.

04:17:24.580 --> 04:17:40.580
So they've been really expanding that work as well as our disproportionality SELPA, who's focused on really helping that we create a better predictive analysis of understanding of who are kids who are at risk and how do we know that and how can we respond to that?

04:17:40.580 --> 04:17:51.580
So a couple highlights of how they're starting to work with LEAs directly, because I think this is the other thing that although they're working to build capacity of the SELPAs, how are then the SELPAs working with the LEAs?

04:17:51.580 --> 04:17:55.580
Ultimately, that is the goal, not just building the capacity of SELPAs.

04:17:55.580 --> 04:17:58.580
We have a lot of SELPAs who also have some really great resources.

04:17:58.580 --> 04:18:07.580
And so how do we also leverage what is already existing and making sure other people are aware based on a particular area of need, like disproportionality, that they know that it exists?

04:18:07.580 --> 04:18:14.580
And I think a really exciting one with our South County SELPA on disproportionality is they're using design thinking as part of that process.

04:18:14.580 --> 04:18:19.580
So how do we disrupt issues of inequity if we're just going to keep looking at the problem with the same lens?

04:18:19.580 --> 04:18:24.580
How do we start to really think differently about issues around disproportionality?

04:18:24.580 --> 04:18:28.580
We've known for a long time who is over identified or under identified.

04:18:28.580 --> 04:18:34.580
We know who's not getting services or are experiencing inequities like suspensions and so on.

04:18:35.580 --> 04:18:37.580
And so what are we going to do differently about it?

04:18:37.580 --> 04:18:40.580
And they really frame it around awareness, action and scale.

04:18:40.580 --> 04:18:51.580
And so they've been working with administrators and teachers, parents and community members and SELPAs on how do you use design thinking strategies to be able to disrupt what you're seeing around disproportionality?

04:18:51.580 --> 04:18:56.580
So they've started those kinds of partnerships with particular LEAs.

04:18:56.580 --> 04:19:15.580
We also have our Imperial County SELPA who's done a phenomenal job of really bringing together the EL roadmap, looking at what we know we're seeing in the data as far as performance for our English learners and our English learners who are students with disabilities and really also leveraging the recent guide, which is just wonderful to see in the state of California.

04:19:15.580 --> 04:19:22.580
Trust me, a lot of people nationally are paying attention to the fact that we have a guide around English learners that are also students with disabilities.

04:19:22.580 --> 04:19:50.580
And so how do we leverage resources, CDE's team, Veronica and others who've been working with us from the EL department to make sure that as we're building out communication, we're making sure it's in alignment to the work Kristen and Veronica are both leading in the state, but also making sure that the SELPA LEAs can really be a resource to other districts as they're struggling with how to be able to meet the needs of language acquisition as well as disability impact.

04:19:50.580 --> 04:20:00.580
They have been working with counties to build their skill capacity or developing modules in partnership with the CDE to be able to use this guide more statewide.

04:20:02.580 --> 04:20:10.580
Then we also have our SELPA from Marin County who have been leading our work around evidence based practices.

04:20:10.580 --> 04:20:26.580
They've been growing regional teams throughout the state of California from the SELPAs to be able to be in depth coaches that could then support other SELPAs and other LEAs in being able to implement evidence based practices for kids with autism.

04:20:26.580 --> 04:20:35.580
This is definitely a population that we find sometimes folks are really struggling with like how do you implement the work knowing that our students are all very different.

04:20:35.580 --> 04:20:38.580
There is a continuum and so the continuum and need looks different.

04:20:38.580 --> 04:20:41.580
So how do you make sure that locally people are available to support?

04:20:41.580 --> 04:20:52.580
And so their strategy has been very much focused on building these kinds of regional teams through the SELPAs and then building their capacity to be strong coaches and trainers as they work with LEAs.

04:20:52.580 --> 04:20:57.580
And so eight teams have already been identified and we look forward to seeing that continue to grow to scale.

04:21:00.580 --> 04:21:04.580
We also have our open access SELPA which is Placer County SELPA.

04:21:04.580 --> 04:21:12.580
They have been already off and running making sure that resources available around universal design for learning are available for folks online.

04:21:12.580 --> 04:21:18.580
And so we include their website here as well because I think there's so much there that folks could really be using now.

04:21:19.580 --> 04:21:28.580
I think the other piece of it is that they're also building regional teams working currently with different SELPAs and county offices and LEAs.

04:21:28.580 --> 04:21:41.580
So they're welcome LEAs to be able to apply to be regional team members with the idea of being able to implement and be a resource to other educators on implementing universal design for learning.

04:21:41.580 --> 04:21:48.580
We're really excited to see how they, for example, I shared with you earlier, been partnering with Shasta going out to help them.

04:21:48.580 --> 04:21:55.580
One of the things that I've been hearing from folks, especially around the SELPA lead, has been how much they've been willing to come out to them.

04:21:55.580 --> 04:22:08.580
It's not a we're offering a training and you come to us very much of where is the need and can we get more local, which I think especially if we're trying to build capacity, people need to feel that it's closer to them than further.

04:22:09.580 --> 04:22:22.580
And then lastly, our system improvement leads are another group that, again, it's so impressive to see how our SELPA leads have just continued to build the resources, be responsive to the things that folks say they immediately need.

04:22:22.580 --> 04:22:30.580
And so the system improvement leads have put out a variety of tools, one being the state performance plan and indicator guide.

04:22:30.580 --> 04:22:40.580
So as we talk more about our state performance indicators, what are the connections that we should be seeing with those performance indicators and other data that we have available to us?

04:22:40.580 --> 04:22:54.580
And so they've created a tool in partnership with the CDE to be able to create something very easily accessible, which I think people have really appreciated and provided training around how to use that data then for continuous improvement.

04:22:54.580 --> 04:22:58.580
So that's the level where they've been able to get more local.

04:22:58.580 --> 04:23:04.580
The next resource that they've created is the data quality toolkit, which is also available now for SELPA.

04:23:04.580 --> 04:23:24.580
So one of the things that folks have really been struggling with is how do you bring all these data pieces that come in different places, how we put them together and be able to generate reports that when we're doing differentiated assistance, for example, that we'd be able to share with our LEAs or be able to serve as information that we use to do some root cause analysis.

04:23:24.580 --> 04:23:31.580
So this is their website to be able to it's gone live, it's available for folks so people can start using it now.

04:23:31.580 --> 04:23:50.580
And I would say the last thing that's a highlight for them, I think, is that they're also putting a conference together in April focused on system improvements and looking at data literacy, data quality, as well as continuous improvement focused on students with disabilities.

04:23:50.580 --> 04:24:01.580
And locally, these are just a couple of the partnerships that they've already started with in order to make sure they're building capacity with county offices as well as school districts.

04:24:01.580 --> 04:24:17.580
I know I've shared a lot around all of them, and so I wanted to make sure you were aware if you have a handout that highlights what their main purpose is, their key focus, as well as their websites and resources that are already available, as well as training and other opportunities to be able to access them.

04:24:17.580 --> 04:24:22.580
And I also want to make sure the public saw that these things were available to them so they can access them.

04:24:22.580 --> 04:24:29.580
I think one of the things as we dive into more of like next steps is we have a lot of work to do around communication.

04:24:29.580 --> 04:24:39.580
I think we're trying to really reflect on what has been working, what has been successful, what are actually people accessing and want more of so we can grow.

04:24:39.580 --> 04:24:51.580
But also recognizing that are we actually saturating the system too much with too much that everyone's offering in that we could be actually leveraging more of the talents within the system of support.

04:24:51.580 --> 04:25:04.580
And I think there's some examples. So for example, the self-leaning disproportionality work has partnered with the equity lead in San Diego, as they were putting out their equity conference and other type of activities related to equity.

04:25:04.580 --> 04:25:09.580
And so there you see a strong partnership growing with a lead. Could we see more of that?

04:25:09.580 --> 04:25:17.580
I think a lot could be the same thing could be said for different leads, but I think we could do an even better job of being more systematic together.

04:25:17.580 --> 04:25:26.580
And so we are Kristen and I are working together to engage and facilitate that kind of reflective thinking with the sample leads.

04:25:26.580 --> 04:25:36.580
We really try to model that continuous improvement is not just something we talk about that we need to engage in and take a pause to make sure that we're meeting the ultimate goal of this grant.

04:25:36.580 --> 04:25:39.580
And Kristen, you want to share a little bit more about next steps?

04:25:39.580 --> 04:25:55.580
Sure. And so we definitely it's been exciting to see the integration of the sample leads into the larger system of support and really starting to work closely with the geo leads in terms of we all know that we all need to build capacity around special education.

04:25:55.580 --> 04:26:01.580
And we've spent a lot of years talking to ourselves, and it's nice to be going out and talking to others too.

04:26:01.580 --> 04:26:16.580
So one of the ways that we want to make sure to demonstrate to you that this isn't just theoretical and we're not just having a good time talking about it all day, is that that we are really partnering directly to support our LEAs utilizing what we have across the state.

04:26:16.580 --> 04:26:24.580
California is very vast. And so we know in order to to grow things, we cannot do it alone and need our partners.

04:26:24.580 --> 04:26:36.580
And so we've been working closely with SELPA, but also with our county offices of education and our districts as well as our lead agencies to try to bring this all together and kind of get a common message.

04:26:36.580 --> 04:26:51.580
And, you know, I don't know about you, but I feel like we are as a state kind of all on the same page right now around that common message around belonging and equity and the fact that we believe in every single one of our students and want to give them the best opportunities we can.

04:26:51.580 --> 04:27:04.580
And so as we think about what's happening in the trenches, we have a couple of our shining team here to talk to you a little bit about.

04:27:04.580 --> 04:27:08.580
Thank you, Carla, to talk about what they're doing in the field.

04:27:08.580 --> 04:27:17.580
And so it's a great pleasure to ask Kevin Schaeffer and Kristen Brooks to come up.

04:27:17.580 --> 04:27:24.580
And Kevin and Kristen are two of our, they work, both work in different county offices.

04:27:24.580 --> 04:27:30.580
Kristen works in Riverside County and Kevin works in El Dorado County, and we'll let them tell you a little bit more about themselves.

04:27:30.580 --> 04:27:39.580
But we are in a deep partnership with them because, as I described before, they are one of our technical assistance projects under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.

04:27:39.580 --> 04:27:43.580
So they're funded and supported through some of our T.A. dollars.

04:27:43.580 --> 04:27:53.580
And so we are we contract with those county offices and then work in partnership with some of my staff in the special ed division for this project to be a project.

04:27:53.580 --> 04:27:58.580
So I think we need to get your PowerPoint up. So if you want to bring that up right now and.

04:28:02.580 --> 04:28:09.580
I'm going to go ahead and hand it off to them. And then at the end, if there are other questions or anything that you need us to come back up for, please let us know.

04:28:23.580 --> 04:28:33.580
Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond, members of the board. It is an honor to be here before you today and share about our project.

04:28:33.580 --> 04:28:39.580
My name is Kristen Brooks, executive director with Riverside County Office of Education and supporting inclusive practices.

04:28:39.580 --> 04:28:45.580
And I'm Kevin Schaeffer, director of program support through the El Dorado County Selfies and the Supporting Inclusive Practices Project.

04:28:45.580 --> 04:28:50.580
And in just a few moments after we're done talking about our project and sharing some information, we're going to bring up Dr.

04:28:50.580 --> 04:28:57.580
Catherine Mahoney from Arcadia, which is the real information you want to see and hear about in terms of right down to the district and student level.

04:28:57.580 --> 04:29:11.580
So our objectives in sharing with you today are just a few, one around providing an overview of our project, supporting inclusive practices, sharing lessons from the field and recommendations for this work as we continue to build capacity and scale throughout the system.

04:29:12.580 --> 04:29:21.580
And then, as I mentioned, learning about Arcadia's journey specifically within this project, work that they're doing collaboratively with us, but as well as kind of flying out of the nest on their own and doing the great work on the ground.

04:29:21.580 --> 04:29:31.580
So the focus of our project is to support district leadership teams in their intentional design and redesign of pre-K through 22 systems and supports for inclusion and achievement.

04:29:31.580 --> 04:29:35.580
And it's specifically for students with disabilities because this is out of the special education division.

04:29:35.580 --> 04:29:40.580
But we really want to emphasize that we're talking about all kids.

04:29:40.580 --> 04:29:51.580
We're talking about students with disabilities, but we're also talking about students of color, foster youth, students identified as English learners, low income, the range, right, as well as students with significant cognitive disabilities and those identified as gifted and talented in shared safe spaces and shared learning environments.

04:29:51.580 --> 04:29:58.580
So although we're talking about students with disabilities, we never leave out that we're really talking about all kids in all spaces.

04:29:58.580 --> 04:30:04.580
And that envisioning starts first and then we build capacity, we implement scale up and pay it forward.

04:30:04.580 --> 04:30:11.580
So once we learn how to build this system and scale it up, how do we support others in the same journey across California?

04:30:11.580 --> 04:30:14.580
And it's really centered on culture, policy and practice.

04:30:14.580 --> 04:30:21.580
So as part of the cultural piece of what we work with our liaison, we've taken it back to the student level.

04:30:21.580 --> 04:30:23.580
And that's the question that we get often.

04:30:23.580 --> 04:30:26.580
How do you impact student level outcomes?

04:30:26.580 --> 04:30:33.580
And one of the ways that we've implemented just really over the past year and a half or two years, we've taken it back to the student level.

04:30:33.580 --> 04:30:34.580
And that's the question that we get often.

04:30:34.580 --> 04:30:37.580
How do you impact student level outcomes?

04:30:37.580 --> 04:30:43.580
And one of the ways that we've implemented just really over the past year, year and a half is looking at identity,

04:30:43.580 --> 04:30:50.580
looking at intersectionality of identities and then also bringing in self-reflection on implicit bias, privilege and power.

04:30:50.580 --> 04:31:01.580
And we look at that through the lens of how is there a barrier potentially created by our belief system as adults and how we interact with students of varying identities?

04:31:01.580 --> 04:31:07.580
So we help our teams understand what identity and what intersectionality is.

04:31:07.580 --> 04:31:19.580
And then we also have them go through a couple of activities and looking at implicit bias and how we approach students who we may not understand their particular identities and how those identities intersect.

04:31:19.580 --> 04:31:23.580
So that self-reflection piece is critical to this conversation.

04:31:23.580 --> 04:31:28.580
And again, we're not focusing solely on students with disabilities, but we're looking at sexual orientation.

04:31:28.580 --> 04:31:29.580
We're looking at race. We're looking at language.

04:31:29.580 --> 04:31:32.580
We're bringing all of those conversations together.

04:31:32.580 --> 04:31:40.580
And then we pull out disability and we look at that one identity and help our teams understand that it's an identity of deficit.

04:31:40.580 --> 04:31:47.580
And if we approach students with disabilities through that lens or mindset that they have a deficit in who they are,

04:31:47.580 --> 04:31:53.580
then we're not going to make any inroads in progress for inclusion of students with disabilities.

04:31:53.580 --> 04:32:04.580
And as Kristen said, we have to look at the whole system and how they got there and how the implicit bias could be that reason for disproportionality in the end result.

04:32:04.580 --> 04:32:10.580
So we ask the question, how does that perception, that adult perception impact student experience and outcomes?

04:32:10.580 --> 04:32:19.580
And then we also in the envisioning phase really help our teams understand what inclusion is, what inclusion is not, and help them to identify what their vision for inclusion is.

04:32:19.580 --> 04:32:24.580
And we get a lot of comments on what inclusion is not.

04:32:24.580 --> 04:32:29.580
And there's a lot of connections with our LEA saying, you know what, we've experienced that before.

04:32:29.580 --> 04:32:31.580
We've experienced dump and hope.

04:32:31.580 --> 04:32:38.580
We've experienced putting students with disabilities in general education classrooms with an untrained aid and calling it effective inclusion.

04:32:38.580 --> 04:32:42.580
It's actually just integration. And they're in a space.

04:32:42.580 --> 04:32:45.580
We talked about the differences between mainstreaming inclusion,

04:32:45.580 --> 04:32:54.580
whether or not students experience a community or a sense of belonging or they're just put in an environment to say that we are in compliance with our LEA indicators.

04:32:54.580 --> 04:32:56.580
Line of sight inclusion.

04:32:56.580 --> 04:33:04.580
You've all seen that cartoon with the three phases with the kids looking into the baseball game and there's the wall in the boxes and the very last one.

04:33:04.580 --> 04:33:09.580
The fence is still there, but they can see all of the other students playing the game, but they're not participating.

04:33:09.580 --> 04:33:11.580
That's line of sight inclusion.

04:33:11.580 --> 04:33:16.580
And then if we're going to do this work for compliance only, then it's not going to be scalable or sustainable.

04:33:16.580 --> 04:33:21.580
So we have those really hard conversations on why are you doing this work and why is it important to you?

04:33:21.580 --> 04:33:31.580
Is it because you didn't meet your indicator targets or because you truly feel that it's a mission to have students with disabilities included effectively in general ed classes?

04:33:31.580 --> 04:33:33.580
So this is really our conceptual framework.

04:33:33.580 --> 04:33:40.580
And this comes out of the work of Booth and Aidsco out in the UK, but very much applies to us out here and really talking about the foundations of culture,

04:33:40.580 --> 04:33:41.580
policy and practice.

04:33:41.580 --> 04:33:43.580
So what is the culture that our districts have?

04:33:43.580 --> 04:33:45.580
What do they believe about all kids?

04:33:45.580 --> 04:33:50.580
What are the policies that that are being enforced that support that culture and that belief about kids?

04:33:50.580 --> 04:33:53.580
And then what are the practices that are happening in the classrooms?

04:33:53.580 --> 04:33:59.580
When we presented before, we talked about how we can't just have really nice vision and mission statements on the walls of our boardrooms.

04:33:59.580 --> 04:34:01.580
We have to really walk the talk, right?

04:34:01.580 --> 04:34:04.580
And so and how is that getting down to the student level?

04:34:04.580 --> 04:34:11.580
We don't want to sit around conference tables and talk about the way that it should be or could be and talk about going slow to go fast and not making any forward movement.

04:34:11.580 --> 04:34:14.580
But really, how are we getting down to the student level to make progress?

04:34:14.580 --> 04:34:19.580
Because that's what our work is all about and leadership at all levels driving this work.

04:34:19.580 --> 04:34:22.580
So we're not just talking about our cabinet members or even our site team administrators.

04:34:22.580 --> 04:34:24.580
We're talking about what are our parent groups?

04:34:24.580 --> 04:34:26.580
What are our union leaders telling us?

04:34:26.580 --> 04:34:31.580
What are our students telling us that we need to do to be more inclusive in our practices?

04:34:31.580 --> 04:34:34.580
So we have created this blueprint for inclusion.

04:34:34.580 --> 04:34:37.580
You may have some of our members here may have seen this before.

04:34:37.580 --> 04:34:47.580
But our blueprint is really centered on research from both the educational world and the business world, really in terms of innovation of ideas and change ideas and change management.

04:34:47.580 --> 04:34:52.580
And so oftentimes our districts will jump to implementing, which is the third phase of our blueprint.

04:34:52.580 --> 04:34:57.580
They'll see the data, they'll see the dashboard light up red and in need reaction say, let's implement.

04:34:57.580 --> 04:35:00.580
We need to go full inclusion tomorrow. We need to be a co-teaching institution tomorrow.

04:35:00.580 --> 04:35:02.580
This needs to happen right now because look at our data.

04:35:02.580 --> 04:35:08.580
And there wasn't really that planning and that forethought and bringing everybody together and saying, OK, what is our current state?

04:35:08.580 --> 04:35:10.580
What is our desired state? How are we going to get there?

04:35:10.580 --> 04:35:12.580
How do we envision this together?

04:35:12.580 --> 04:35:14.580
And when we have our meetings, who's missing from the table?

04:35:14.580 --> 04:35:17.580
Who needs to be here to have these conversations?

04:35:17.580 --> 04:35:23.580
So having that cohesive leadership team looking at our vision, mission and values and are we again really walking the talk?

04:35:23.580 --> 04:35:27.580
Where do we want to be in terms of our of our long term outcomes?

04:35:28.580 --> 04:35:31.580
Communicating with clarity and urgency of purpose.

04:35:31.580 --> 04:35:34.580
Sometimes our districts are telling us, well, we tried that.

04:35:34.580 --> 04:35:36.580
We tried that inclusion thing and it didn't work.

04:35:36.580 --> 04:35:41.580
Our teachers were really inundated and afraid of what was happening toward this inclusion movement.

04:35:41.580 --> 04:35:46.580
And oftentimes it's because nobody knows their role, the expectation, what this is supposed to look like.

04:35:46.580 --> 04:35:53.580
One of the analogies we use is, you know, if we gave everyone in this room several puzzle pieces and said, you know, you can pick whoever you want on your team.

04:35:53.580 --> 04:35:55.580
As much time as you want, as much chocolate and coffee as you need.

04:35:55.580 --> 04:35:57.580
Go ahead and put it together. Could you do it?

04:35:57.580 --> 04:35:59.580
Yeah, we could do it. What would make it easier?

04:35:59.580 --> 04:36:01.580
Well, if we saw the picture, what it's supposed to look like, right?

04:36:01.580 --> 04:36:10.580
We can all build the puzzle eventually, but it really helps if we know the direction that we're going and that clarity and that sense of shared purpose and accountability and responsibility.

04:36:10.580 --> 04:36:13.580
And then really around persuasion and first adopters.

04:36:13.580 --> 04:36:22.580
Not everybody's going to be in the boat at the same time on day one, but really starting with a forward movement with those folks who are your early adopters in this work and then building it out.

04:36:22.580 --> 04:36:26.580
And then implementing scaling it up and then paying it forward as we talked about.

04:36:26.580 --> 04:36:29.580
So Dr. Mahoney is going to come up and share her experience in Arcadia.

04:36:29.580 --> 04:36:44.580
But she was one of Arcadia was one of our what we call transformational districts really working toward that that change and now has become an exemplar to then pay it forward and show others and tour others at the site and meet with their leadership teams and talk about how they created change on the ground.

04:36:44.580 --> 04:36:48.580
So this is really our blueprint and our method to our madness.

04:36:48.580 --> 04:36:55.580
So our structure, as Kristen shared, we have a shared partnership between El Dorado in the north and Riverside in the south to cover the state.

04:36:55.580 --> 04:37:03.580
We currently work with 45 different local educational agencies and that's anything from single schools to self as in county offices throughout the state.

04:37:03.580 --> 04:37:08.580
It is voluntary. This is not, as Kevin mentioned, a compliance driven project.

04:37:08.580 --> 04:37:11.580
This is really are you in this? Here's what our project is about.

04:37:11.580 --> 04:37:14.580
Here's how the tiered technical supports work.

04:37:15.580 --> 04:37:20.580
Are you ready for the support? You know, are you in this with us? Because it can't, again, just be from a compliance lens.

04:37:20.580 --> 04:37:24.580
People really need to be in that space and willing to create change.

04:37:24.580 --> 04:37:29.580
So our districts are at least cycle out about three to four years or so to make room for others to participate.

04:37:29.580 --> 04:37:35.580
And we have a lengthy waiting list of folks who are really wanting the same type of boots on the ground support.

04:37:35.580 --> 04:37:48.580
Los Angeles Unified is our largest district with 100 plus school sites really implementing these inclusive practices or more inclusive practices as well as rural sites with just one or two schools that really impact the entire community.

04:37:48.580 --> 04:37:52.580
So we're as far down south as Imperial County and as far north as Siskiyou.

04:37:52.580 --> 04:37:56.580
And we are on the road all the time.

04:37:56.580 --> 04:38:04.580
We live on the road. CDE was really, really clear. They wanted to make sure that our project was tiered in terms of the level of support that we provide.

04:38:04.580 --> 04:38:14.580
So at the tier one or universal level, any district, any school, any LEA, any county office, SELPA, can participate in the tasks that are on your screen right now.

04:38:14.580 --> 04:38:20.580
So we have a website. If you go to our website, you can see our team. You can see our grantees, our exemplars.

04:38:20.580 --> 04:38:29.580
Under the tab that says what we do, you can also see the events that we host for free for any LEA to participate in.

04:38:29.580 --> 04:38:39.580
We host webinars and we also do some thought partnering with any LEAs that call us just to kind of talk through any of the questions that they have.

04:38:39.580 --> 04:38:43.580
We have a pretty large social media presence on Facebook and Twitter.

04:38:43.580 --> 04:38:58.580
We put everything that we do everywhere that we are and anything that's going on in CDE's world just to create a community across California so that everybody is clear on what's happening and what they can take or participate in.

04:38:58.580 --> 04:39:05.580
We have our in-person and our virtual events. We also work with the thought partnering with the leadership teams.

04:39:05.580 --> 04:39:13.580
But I think one of the biggest tasks that we provide is making the connections between all of the resources around system of support.

04:39:13.580 --> 04:39:25.580
So we try to really understand how the system of support is working and who the contact individuals are within each of the leads and the geo leads, the SELPA system improvement leads, the content leads,

04:39:25.580 --> 04:39:30.580
just to make sure that all of our grantees have access to the work that's being done.

04:39:30.580 --> 04:39:35.580
We find that there is a lot of confusion or LEAs that don't know what's available to them.

04:39:35.580 --> 04:39:43.580
That's a huge role that we play in our thought partnering and our support of LEAs across the state and those in the project.

04:39:43.580 --> 04:39:49.580
So tier two, our strategic level of support for the 45 grantees that are in the project.

04:39:49.580 --> 04:39:59.580
All of their professional development is personalized. So we work with the LEAs on their PIR plans, their LCAPs, developing activities, and then the actual implementation of those activities.

04:39:59.580 --> 04:40:09.580
So if they choose to really focus on universal design for learning, we would help them either make the connections to the content lead out of placer or we would provide the professional development ourselves.

04:40:09.580 --> 04:40:19.580
We also work with leadership teams, not just special education leadership teams, but we want the entire district leadership team to be a part of the conversations in the planning.

04:40:19.580 --> 04:40:25.580
Each of the LEAs are also afforded grant funding over the course of the three to four years that they're with the project.

04:40:25.580 --> 04:40:37.580
And with that grant funding, they can use it to create communities of practice, PLCs, they can send their teachers and administrators to events or bring speakers into their LEAs.

04:40:37.580 --> 04:40:45.580
So it's specifically focused on what their needs are and then making connections, not just within the system of support, but really looking broadly.

04:40:45.580 --> 04:40:52.580
We know that if we only focus on special education teachers and administrators in special education, we will not make the growth that we would like to make.

04:40:52.580 --> 04:41:10.580
So we also, with the assistance of Kristen and Carla, helping us to make those connections to who are state leaders in secondary transition and workability, behavior restraint and seclusion, AB2657, California PBIS Coalition, CAPTN, Institutes of Higher Education.

04:41:10.580 --> 04:41:15.580
Institutes of Higher Education are now redefining their teacher preparation programs around universal design for learning.

04:41:16.580 --> 04:41:27.580
So we're heavily in to the institutes and the planning of what that would look like and helping the IHEs understand what the needs are of LEAs.

04:41:27.580 --> 04:41:41.580
And then labor management initiative, working with Ed Honorwitz on how do we create relations between labor and management that do impact students with disabilities positively.

04:41:41.580 --> 04:41:43.580
So Kristen had mentioned we focus on policy.

04:41:43.580 --> 04:41:48.580
This is a huge area where policy can dictate students being excluded in our system.

04:41:51.580 --> 04:41:55.580
We also wanted to provide you a list of grantees and exemplars.

04:41:55.580 --> 04:41:58.580
The exemplars are in blue. The grantees are in green.

04:41:58.580 --> 04:42:02.580
You can find this on our website also under who we are.

04:42:02.580 --> 04:42:09.580
We also have a map of California on the website where these LEAs are listed on pins on the map.

04:42:09.580 --> 04:42:13.580
We found this morning that we had an LEA in Mexico, so we're correcting that right now.

04:42:16.580 --> 04:42:21.580
So we also just wanted to list our partnerships across California.

04:42:21.580 --> 04:42:23.580
We talked about many of them.

04:42:23.580 --> 04:42:31.580
We are also, as part of our contract, working with Mary Grady and the Edge publication on our website, brand new tab.

04:42:31.580 --> 04:42:37.580
All of the Edge publications are updated and archived on the tab farthest to the right.

04:42:38.580 --> 04:42:41.580
So a list of partners and then our priorities.

04:42:41.580 --> 04:42:47.580
Our priorities, again, are not just special education focused, but really looking at systemically,

04:42:47.580 --> 04:42:53.580
how do each one of these priorities impact positively or negatively within the local context of our LEAs?

04:42:53.580 --> 04:43:01.580
And I think that's a really important point to make is that we don't dictate how LEAs implement their inclusive practices or their inclusion.

04:43:01.580 --> 04:43:06.580
We really look at what is their local context and then how do we move that forward

04:43:06.580 --> 04:43:11.580
within what their identified priorities and initiatives are.

04:43:11.580 --> 04:43:16.580
Just a quick slide of our website that we're very proud of.

04:43:16.580 --> 04:43:20.580
And then finally, we're also asked, what does personalized approach look like?

04:43:20.580 --> 04:43:22.580
So just three examples.

04:43:22.580 --> 04:43:28.580
One of the local LEAs that we're working with, their local context was they were developing their LCAP,

04:43:28.580 --> 04:43:35.580
they were developing their PIR, and they were coming up with activities, one of those activities being universal design for learning.

04:43:35.580 --> 04:43:37.580
So they asked us, what would this look like?

04:43:37.580 --> 04:43:43.580
So we created a professional development plan for this year for all of their secondary teachers and their administrators,

04:43:43.580 --> 04:43:50.580
where our team were small but mighty, but four of the members of the team would come in on the exact same day on four different campuses

04:43:50.580 --> 04:43:57.580
with the same information so that every secondary teacher and administrator received the same information across the course of this year.

04:43:57.580 --> 04:44:02.580
Next year, we're looking at implementing with elementary administrators and elementary teachers.

04:44:02.580 --> 04:44:06.580
Same message and same vision.

04:44:06.580 --> 04:44:13.580
Another one of our local LEAs, their local context was the adoption of a new ELA and math curriculum.

04:44:13.580 --> 04:44:20.580
So their focus was really working with their ed specialists to help them understand what UDL means in terms of a lesson

04:44:20.580 --> 04:44:27.580
planning framework around equity and access so that they could work with their general ed teachers to build that capacity.

04:44:27.580 --> 04:44:33.580
So we worked with their ed specialists, we worked with their paraeducators to really help them understand what it means to lesson plan

04:44:33.580 --> 04:44:36.580
around the idea of access and equity.

04:44:36.580 --> 04:44:43.580
And then finally, Carla had talked about how all of the lead work is coming together using the Shasta geo leads,

04:44:43.580 --> 04:44:47.580
really identifying what the priorities are in their counties in the far north.

04:44:47.580 --> 04:44:55.580
And then a lot of their staff utilized the SELPA systems improvement work, went through that training, brought that back, and they identified UDL.

04:44:55.580 --> 04:45:00.580
So they contacted Jill King in Placer for the content lead around universal design for learning.

04:45:00.580 --> 04:45:04.580
What we realized, we have grantees in the far north that we've been working with.

04:45:04.580 --> 04:45:09.580
So our integration is to help sustain after the content lead work is gone,

04:45:09.580 --> 04:45:15.580
but then also understanding what they're being exposed to so that we can continue that work with the grantees.

04:45:15.580 --> 04:45:21.580
And then we also looked at the SIP alignment across all of the counties that we work with.

04:45:22.580 --> 04:45:27.580
And out of that came a conversation with Reading Unified School District saying we would like to get into the project.

04:45:27.580 --> 04:45:37.580
So it's kind of how everything is integrating from the geo lead all the way to the requests of LEAs being asked to come into the project.

04:45:37.580 --> 04:45:40.580
So just a little bit of data and Catherine's going to share a little bit more.

04:45:40.580 --> 04:45:45.580
But when we're looking at specifically indicator five of those indicators that Kristen had mentioned,

04:45:45.580 --> 04:45:50.580
indicator five is least restrictive environment for ages six through 21.

04:45:50.580 --> 04:45:56.580
And so when we're looking sort of at the target area across those five years or so, five to six years,

04:45:56.580 --> 04:46:02.580
we're looking at a three percent increase in students who have IEPs included 80 percent or more of the day.

04:46:02.580 --> 04:46:10.580
So this is specific to indicator five A, let's say five B is included 40 percent or less of the day and C is outside

04:46:10.580 --> 04:46:15.580
or separate schooling or nonpublic placement, let's say home hospital and others.

04:46:15.580 --> 04:46:20.580
So the increase in just five A. So again, participation in general education, 80 percent or more of the day.

04:46:20.580 --> 04:46:23.580
The state target is three percent across five years.

04:46:23.580 --> 04:46:33.580
When we look at SIP overall, we're seeing a three point three seven percent increase in one year and then an average of five to twelve percent across three years.

04:46:33.580 --> 04:46:39.580
So when we're looking at our districts that we're working with and doing that deep dive and rolling our sleeves up, boots on the ground work,

04:46:39.580 --> 04:46:42.580
again, not just sort of pushing out resources from behind our desk,

04:46:42.580 --> 04:46:47.580
pushing out all across California and saying we are here to show you how these resources map to where you want to be.

04:46:47.580 --> 04:46:49.580
And we really want to be in this work with you.

04:46:49.580 --> 04:46:54.580
And when we see that really deep dive with districts, we're seeing a really amazing increase.

04:46:54.580 --> 04:46:56.580
And it's not, again, what Kevin mentioned.

04:46:56.580 --> 04:46:59.580
We're not walking over the toolkit and saying, here's how you do inclusion.

04:46:59.580 --> 04:47:06.580
It's what is your culture, your context in your community, your students and families, what are their needs and what does the landscape look like for you?

04:47:06.580 --> 04:47:08.580
And how do we build that out for you?

04:47:08.580 --> 04:47:15.580
And then we have some outliers, as as Catherine will mention, where their increases are upwards of more like twenty four percent.

04:47:15.580 --> 04:47:24.580
So some quick lessons learned just that this is an organic process, again, cannot be a toolkit and there's intentional design and sometimes redesign.

04:47:24.580 --> 04:47:27.580
Sometimes things are in place that we're not producing the outcomes that we want for our students.

04:47:27.580 --> 04:47:30.580
So we go back. There's nothing wrong with going back.

04:47:30.580 --> 04:47:36.580
If something is not working for kids, we don't say, OK, let's wait till let's wait till July or August and let something sit in place.

04:47:37.580 --> 04:47:44.580
We really want to be able to intentionally design and redesign those systems and that our first adopters really have to be our school boards and our superintendents.

04:47:44.580 --> 04:47:48.580
We have to have the support from all areas for this work to really be successful.

04:47:48.580 --> 04:47:52.580
Breaking down those silos and self-imposed barriers and we talk about self-imposed barriers.

04:47:52.580 --> 04:47:55.580
We're talking about what are those policies and practices that we have put in place?

04:47:55.580 --> 04:47:59.580
What does that master schedule look like? What is our professional development calendar look like?

04:47:59.580 --> 04:48:02.580
How much collaborative time are we really providing for our teachers?

04:48:02.580 --> 04:48:09.580
Are we engaging our parents or have we imposed those barriers that are limiting our ability to be more inclusive models?

04:48:09.580 --> 04:48:12.580
And that it's really not a student readiness model.

04:48:12.580 --> 04:48:17.580
We can't say when the kids are ready to be included, the kids are already ready to be included.

04:48:17.580 --> 04:48:22.580
It's our systems. It's the adult and the system readiness model, not the student readiness model.

04:48:22.580 --> 04:48:27.580
So sometimes it really is about mindset and we know that that's the hardest piece to shift around mindset.

04:48:28.580 --> 04:48:31.580
And we know that we have to appeal to that sort of rational and emotional side of folks.

04:48:31.580 --> 04:48:35.580
The rational side being here's the data, this works, here's the research around inclusion.

04:48:35.580 --> 04:48:39.580
And the emotional side is this is a moral imperative for our kids.

04:48:39.580 --> 04:48:45.580
And really a re-culturing, as Michael Fullen says, with relationships as the foundation for change.

04:48:45.580 --> 04:48:48.580
So just some quick recommendations and building capacity.

04:48:48.580 --> 04:48:52.580
Continuing this regionalized and personalized tiered system.

04:48:52.580 --> 04:48:54.580
So we know that, as Kevin mentioned, we're small but mighty.

04:48:54.580 --> 04:48:56.580
So we have these 45 folks that we dig in deep.

04:48:56.580 --> 04:49:02.580
But having that tier one where everybody can access at no cost and local to them, north, central, south events,

04:49:02.580 --> 04:49:07.580
virtual in person to really have a variety so that we can reach as many folks as we can with this work.

04:49:07.580 --> 04:49:13.580
But keeping the boots on the ground and listening and moving forward and connecting resources and initiatives and priorities.

04:49:13.580 --> 04:49:20.580
Matching our resources as we're looking at increasing those indicator targets in this next round of state performance plan.

04:49:20.580 --> 04:49:26.580
So we have clarity around the purpose and our sense of urgency with intentional design and measurable outcomes.

04:49:26.580 --> 04:49:31.580
We really have to have that data piece to show that these outcomes are working for students.

04:49:31.580 --> 04:49:39.580
And then once we see that success, really having a platform to celebrate that success and call that out and share that broadly.

04:49:39.580 --> 04:49:43.580
So leaving you just with this quote as we bring Catherine up that we do the best we can until we know better.

04:49:43.580 --> 04:49:45.580
And then once we know better, we do better.

04:49:45.580 --> 04:49:49.580
So Catherine Mahoney is here because she knows better and she's doing better.

04:49:49.580 --> 04:49:51.580
So we'd like to introduce Dr. Catherine Mahoney.

04:49:52.580 --> 04:49:54.580
Hello. Thank you so much for having me.

04:49:54.580 --> 04:50:02.580
I can't tell you how thrilled I am because really it's just the next few slides are just me getting to brag about my kids and our staff and our organization.

04:50:02.580 --> 04:50:06.580
And so I'm very grateful for that opportunity.

04:50:06.580 --> 04:50:13.580
Arcadia, as you can see, is a district of about ninety four hundred students, TK through 12th grades generally,

04:50:13.580 --> 04:50:18.580
although we of course support preschool through 22 with our special education programs.

04:50:18.580 --> 04:50:26.580
We have 11 school sites, six elementary schools, three middle schools, one comprehensive high school and one alternative school of choice lab school.

04:50:27.580 --> 04:50:32.580
So we're medium. This is some demographic information.

04:50:34.580 --> 04:50:40.580
What you'll see, what might be highlighted is that we have a relatively small population of students with disabilities,

04:50:40.580 --> 04:50:46.580
which you'll see is related directly to the support we've gotten and the efforts we've made over the years.

04:50:46.580 --> 04:50:54.580
Our largest population, our largest student group is Asian, sixty five point six percent students in that category.

04:50:54.580 --> 04:51:01.580
And we are a high performing school district, which is interesting in the sense of inclusion and LRE,

04:51:01.580 --> 04:51:06.580
because while that's seen as a positive across many contexts,

04:51:06.580 --> 04:51:13.580
when we're looking at trying to include students with learning needs, that sometimes has been a barrier for us.

04:51:13.580 --> 04:51:21.580
And so that's been a lot of the cultural mindset changes that we've worked on as we took on this work.

04:51:21.580 --> 04:51:24.580
Again, really proud of how our district does overall.

04:51:26.580 --> 04:51:35.580
However, back in 2014, 15, what we were seeing with our data for students with disabilities was that we were definitely going in the wrong direction.

04:51:36.580 --> 04:51:44.580
So as our teachers were trying to figure out how to maintain those lovely blues and high test scores,

04:51:44.580 --> 04:51:50.580
they struggled with figuring out how to teach that broad spectrum of student need within one classroom.

04:51:50.580 --> 04:52:02.580
And so we had a trajectory where we were then pulling students out of those general settings to give them those specialized alternative modes of instruction.

04:52:02.580 --> 04:52:06.580
And so that's when we were given the opportunity to apply for the grant,

04:52:06.580 --> 04:52:12.580
because our data was not only poor in terms of our students with disabilities in LRE, but going in the wrong direction.

04:52:13.580 --> 04:52:15.580
So we're now closer to about five years.

04:52:15.580 --> 04:52:25.580
And what we focused on with the support of Kevin and Kristen was universal design for learning and co teaching.

04:52:25.580 --> 04:52:27.580
And we looked at that because of the different grade levels.

04:52:27.580 --> 04:52:32.580
So universal design for learning really was a good fit for our elementary sites,

04:52:32.580 --> 04:52:36.580
whereas our secondary sites really co teaching seem to be a better fit in meeting student need.

04:52:36.580 --> 04:52:47.580
So we are currently based on our own kind of live data analysis at 56 percent of our students spending 80 percent or more of their day in general education settings,

04:52:47.580 --> 04:52:54.580
which is what the state target is right now and is more than about 28 percent growth over a five year period.

04:52:54.580 --> 04:52:58.580
So we're really excited because while that data speaks a lot on its own,

04:52:58.580 --> 04:53:03.580
there are a thousand stories behind that data of individual students doing more than they thought they could do,

04:53:03.580 --> 04:53:10.580
teachers doing more than they thought they could do and parents coming to us and saying they also feel more included.

04:53:10.580 --> 04:53:11.580
They feel more part of the community.

04:53:11.580 --> 04:53:18.580
So the data tells us a lot, but there is just more rich narrative data that I can't capture here.

04:53:19.580 --> 04:53:25.580
The seven point nine percent of our population of students includes our preschool to 22 year olds.

04:53:25.580 --> 04:53:32.580
But again, is a quite low rate of identification because what we're finding is that our schools are able to support kids without labeling them.

04:53:32.580 --> 04:53:43.580
They're able to use those skills that they've learned through the training and the design through the grant to worry more about getting the services and supports to students

04:53:43.580 --> 04:53:49.580
than creating the assessment processes and the documents and all of that while still ensuring that they're being successful.

04:53:49.580 --> 04:53:53.580
Our graduation rate for students with disabilities is ninety two point four percent.

04:53:53.580 --> 04:53:59.580
And really exciting to me is the post school outcomes because really we're not just about giving getting them to a diploma,

04:53:59.580 --> 04:54:05.580
but making sure that all of our students are successfully engaged in their communities once they leave us.

04:54:05.580 --> 04:54:10.580
So sixty three point nine percent of our students are engaged in higher education.

04:54:10.580 --> 04:54:17.580
Almost eighty nine percent are engaged in competitive employment and ninety seven point two two percent are engaged in any employment or education.

04:54:17.580 --> 04:54:22.580
And again, this is specific to students with disabilities.

04:54:22.580 --> 04:54:31.580
I'm sure you're familiar with this data, but just as a point of reference, this is the performance data for across the state of California for students with disabilities.

04:54:31.580 --> 04:54:35.580
ELA at about sixteen point two percent and twelve point six percent with mathematics.

04:54:35.580 --> 04:54:40.580
And what I'd like to highlight for you is the growth we've seen in three of our schools.

04:54:40.580 --> 04:54:44.580
One is a high school setting. The other two are elementary settings.

04:54:44.580 --> 04:54:54.580
And from 2015 16 to 2018 19, we now have students with disabilities who are meeting or exceeding standard at a rate of 50 percent.

04:54:55.580 --> 04:55:05.580
So it's exciting because that is truly reflective of we're not doing what Kevin kind of referenced at one point of dumping and hoping we're not just including them in a setting,

04:55:05.580 --> 04:55:12.580
but we're truly supporting them to to be strong learners who are making progress.

04:55:12.580 --> 04:55:23.580
What this doesn't show, which I also appreciate it from the sense of the support is that we actually had a drop in scores for students with disabilities over that five year period before we pick back up,

04:55:23.580 --> 04:55:35.580
which I think is reflective of the learning of the system, the teachers learning how to do these things, being having that productive struggle like we expect our students to do where they don't just have an upward trajectory of learning,

04:55:35.580 --> 04:55:41.580
but rather they struggle. They don't always do it well. They don't do it right the first time.

04:55:41.580 --> 04:55:46.580
One of our district values is learn from failure. And that was evident in our data, I think, at some points.

04:55:46.580 --> 04:55:53.580
But when we look and track our students overall, they made progress with us. So we everybody works together.

04:55:53.580 --> 04:55:58.580
The students and the teachers and the staff and the principals all grew together.

04:55:58.580 --> 04:56:08.580
The way we approach this that was very much supported by the grant leadership was making sure that we ensured the organization knew the why.

04:56:08.580 --> 04:56:12.580
And we actually spent a year on that. We didn't do any change to program.

04:56:12.580 --> 04:56:19.580
All we did was look at our why. And then the other area of focus we selected was principal leadership.

04:56:19.580 --> 04:56:36.580
We spent a lot of time ensuring that they were the lead learners who could support this effort, lead it from the front, answer questions and be there to then also design very specific SIP plans for their individual school site based on school site need.

04:56:36.580 --> 04:56:50.580
So for us, and it was already referenced earlier, the SIP grant design itself really married a focus professional development opportunities with experts from across the nation with local choice and self-determination that allowed us to meet our district's unique needs.

04:56:50.580 --> 04:56:59.580
So we were given that flexibility and really the coaching and the grace provided by Dr. Brooks and Mr. Schaeffer was absolutely instrumental to our progress.

04:57:00.580 --> 04:57:09.580
There was a lot of cheerleading, a lot of coaching, which was really helpful because it wasn't always that squiggly line.

04:57:09.580 --> 04:57:15.580
That's more of what we followed versus that straight line to get to where we are now.

04:57:15.580 --> 04:57:28.580
So just to give you a brief kind of overview of our journey, in 2016-17, again, we just focused on our why and we just trained our Board of Education, our cabinet and principals regarding what LRE was.

04:57:28.580 --> 04:57:33.580
And everybody had to identify their own why because different people have different whys, right?

04:57:33.580 --> 04:57:37.580
For some people, it was a compliance need. For other people, there was a moral imperative.

04:57:37.580 --> 04:57:45.580
There was a social justice imperative, but if we didn't focus on that, then we weren't sure that we'd be able to maintain course.

04:57:45.580 --> 04:57:48.580
We might stray from what the actual goal was.

04:57:48.580 --> 04:57:50.580
And then we spent a lot of time checking the data.

04:57:50.580 --> 04:57:59.580
There's a lot of data that, you know, if you just flip those numbers and you have them in the wrong place, we didn't want to turn the ship based on bad navigational data, right?

04:57:59.580 --> 04:58:10.580
And so we spent a lot of time with our staff building in structures where we check that data all the time to make sure that the choices we were making was based on good data.

04:58:10.580 --> 04:58:14.580
We then, in 2017-18, felt prepared to work with our teachers.

04:58:14.580 --> 04:58:27.580
So made sure that then we provided co-teaching training to all of our secondary special educators and voluntary identified general educators because we wanted people who love this idea or are passionate and were on board with it with us.

04:58:27.580 --> 04:58:33.580
We also sent a small group of coaches and principals to UDL training at CAST using SIP funds to do that.

04:58:33.580 --> 04:58:37.580
We went to Indiana for this training.

04:58:37.580 --> 04:58:49.580
We worked with principals to then also develop individual site LRE plans because we were hoping to model the support we'd gotten from SIP in looking at this isn't a monolithic change that would happen.

04:58:50.580 --> 04:58:57.580
It really needed to be based on the unique needs of school sites, the unique skill sets of school sites, staff as well.

04:58:57.580 --> 04:59:07.580
When we, you'll see a little bit later, we spent some time looking at Hattie research and self-efficacy and knowing that our staff needed to believe that they had the skill set to make these changes and people are at different levels with that.

04:59:07.580 --> 04:59:13.580
So we want to make sure that principals had the leeway to develop that in their staffs.

04:59:13.580 --> 04:59:18.580
In 2018-19, we continued with another small group of principals attending CAST trainings.

04:59:18.580 --> 04:59:22.580
We then just kind of built capacity training more and more people who came on board.

04:59:22.580 --> 04:59:44.580
And really it was the positive feedback that we that spread out amongst the groups really built itself that they were able to come back and share that our high performing students who say in our high school setting, which is highly competitive initially thought, well, that's going to be something that kids who have learning needs need and require.

04:59:44.580 --> 04:59:47.580
And they truly ended up saying, you know, I learned better that way.

04:59:47.580 --> 04:59:50.580
It was so nice to have two people who could explain it two different ways.

04:59:50.580 --> 05:00:01.580
And although I didn't need it, I benefited from it, which is a UDL philosophy, of course, that what was essential for some students to be able to access and participate benefited a wide variety of students.

05:00:01.580 --> 05:00:09.580
Teachers also really appreciated learning from one another, which was a nice byproduct as well of this initiative.

05:00:10.580 --> 05:00:28.580
We also spent some of our money investing in collaboration and planning time because that was the number one piece of feedback we got as we were working on this, that teachers just didn't have enough time for the rich conversations that had to occur in order for this to be successful, effective and not frustrating.

05:00:28.580 --> 05:00:35.580
And then in the beginning of this year, our coaches asked to be trained in UDL.

05:00:35.580 --> 05:00:43.580
Even though they weren't special ed coaches or LRE coaches, they were content area coaches, but they wanted to infuse their practice with UDL practices.

05:00:43.580 --> 05:00:49.580
So that became the way that we provide instruction in different content areas.

05:00:49.580 --> 05:00:57.580
And so they the SIP monies again funded UDL courses for all of our instructional coaches to participate in.

05:00:57.580 --> 05:01:09.580
Katie Novak came and did our district wide staff development day, which I think speaks volumes about our board support and our superintendent support and the principal support that everyone got on board to say this is so important.

05:01:09.580 --> 05:01:23.580
We would like to have this be our day long speaker, which I go back to that first year where we got them to believe how important this was and make sure that they knew that this was a sustained effort over time.

05:01:23.580 --> 05:01:28.580
So they would come back and invest in this when we were ready for that.

05:01:28.580 --> 05:01:32.580
We've also then continued the co-teaching training for additional staff if they've come on.

05:01:32.580 --> 05:01:35.580
Collaboration and planning time again was where some of the funding went.

05:01:35.580 --> 05:01:40.580
And then spending additional training funds for principals.

05:01:40.580 --> 05:01:45.580
Again, principals be really, really important to this initiative for us.

05:01:46.580 --> 05:01:50.580
So some cultural changes that were really significant for us.

05:01:50.580 --> 05:01:58.580
Again, I already mentioned our board of education executive cabinet frequently speaking to the value of inclusion and our initiatives that that's just part of who we are.

05:01:58.580 --> 05:02:03.580
We believe that that's who Arcadia is.

05:02:03.580 --> 05:02:05.580
I thought of a more professional way to write this, but I didn't.

05:02:05.580 --> 05:02:08.580
I've been adopted by our education services department.

05:02:08.580 --> 05:02:13.580
This is the first district I've been in where I'm not in a different building.

05:02:13.580 --> 05:02:15.580
I'm not on a different floor.

05:02:15.580 --> 05:02:22.580
I'm not under a department that I'm like, why am I under MOT or whatever it might be?

05:02:22.580 --> 05:02:25.580
I am at their weekly meetings.

05:02:25.580 --> 05:02:27.580
I am presumed to be there.

05:02:27.580 --> 05:02:29.580
I am expected to be at the table.

05:02:29.580 --> 05:02:30.580
I'm expected to participate.

05:02:30.580 --> 05:02:36.580
And when I have something that comes up, they expect of themselves that they are helping me with a solution.

05:02:36.580 --> 05:02:45.580
And that we are just fluid in in our efforts together and just even the we talk a lot about the importance of language.

05:02:45.580 --> 05:02:53.580
The idea that these are all of our students and that they can see the value I bring to their conversations because I have areas of expertise that they didn't know they needed to know.

05:02:53.580 --> 05:02:57.580
And they have expertise and things I didn't know was important for my kids.

05:02:57.580 --> 05:03:00.580
So I don't know a lot about the district benchmarking, perhaps.

05:03:01.580 --> 05:03:11.580
And because we're able to have these fluid conversations, I see how I can bring value to that process that ultimately will help kids in the classroom.

05:03:11.580 --> 05:03:18.580
The hiring processes for our cabinet level employees, many of our employee categories include questions about inclusion.

05:03:18.580 --> 05:03:24.580
So I think from the get go, we are setting the tone that this is a value and expectation within our district.

05:03:24.580 --> 05:03:31.580
And ultimately, relationships, relationships, relationships modeled by the SIP leads that we have.

05:03:31.580 --> 05:03:43.580
But our students, our families, our staff interdepartmentally, I don't know how we would have made the progress we made if we weren't willing to all just jump in and trust each other.

05:03:43.580 --> 05:03:47.580
Families had to trust us because we were recommending things for their kiddos.

05:03:47.580 --> 05:03:52.580
That seems scary. And they trusted us to do what was good for kids.

05:03:52.580 --> 05:03:59.580
And then our staff also having to trust us that we may believe more in them than they believed in themselves at times.

05:03:59.580 --> 05:04:07.580
But that we would provide whatever resources and supports we could, knowing that we had SIP behind us to make that claim, right?

05:04:07.580 --> 05:04:12.580
That we said we can send you to PD or we can give you a collab time to do this work.

05:04:18.580 --> 05:04:19.580
Thank you.

05:04:19.580 --> 05:04:25.580
So I'm going to ask our liaison, Nikki Sandoval, if she'd like to say a few framing comments.

05:04:25.580 --> 05:04:36.580
And then Member Strauss, who has sat in on some of this work as well, will then take clarifying questions and go to public comment and then come back for discussion.

05:04:36.580 --> 05:04:38.580
Okay. Thank you.

05:04:38.580 --> 05:04:44.580
I just want to applaud the great work and the leadership of Kristen Wright.

05:04:44.580 --> 05:04:52.580
And I was delighted to hear from Dr. Estrada, too, because it really demonstrates how far we've come.

05:04:52.580 --> 05:05:03.580
And when I first joined the board seven years ago, it was right around the time or right before the task force report was issued.

05:05:03.580 --> 05:05:09.580
So while the challenges are not new, the approaches that we're taking now are.

05:05:09.580 --> 05:05:18.580
We're seeing challenges that have existed for a long time, practices that have not benefited our students very well at all.

05:05:18.580 --> 05:05:22.580
We're looking at these challenges through fresh and through many different eyes.

05:05:22.580 --> 05:05:25.580
And so that is exciting.

05:05:25.580 --> 05:05:31.580
And it speaks to the unwavering commitment to one coherent system of support.

05:05:31.580 --> 05:05:35.580
These aren't programs. These aren't isolated services.

05:05:35.580 --> 05:05:42.580
We are rebuilding a structure that not only serves students with disabilities, but all students in California.

05:05:42.580 --> 05:05:44.580
So I just want to shine a light on that.

05:05:44.580 --> 05:05:48.580
The report, the plan was outstanding.

05:05:48.580 --> 05:05:55.580
I love the illustration of the different content leads, the system improvement leads and how that all fits together.

05:05:55.580 --> 05:05:59.580
And then hearing the real life examples today.

05:05:59.580 --> 05:06:01.580
I love the energy of our last presenter.

05:06:01.580 --> 05:06:05.580
You're pumped. It's great.

05:06:05.580 --> 05:06:14.580
So I just want to acknowledge and support the outstanding work that's happened and the directions that we're going as a state.

05:06:14.580 --> 05:06:17.580
And I think the whole nation is watching.

05:06:17.580 --> 05:06:21.580
So I'm very supportive of this plan as it exists.

05:06:21.580 --> 05:06:27.580
And when the time comes to to make a motion in support, I'd be happy to do that.

05:06:27.580 --> 05:06:33.580
So I'll just follow up with Member Sandoval and just picking up recently with the work.

05:06:33.580 --> 05:06:44.580
I, too, want to thank Kristen and her incredible leadership through this work and Carla for your work in CCE and for our self-beliefs and for Catherine Mahoney from Arcadia.

05:06:44.580 --> 05:06:45.580
I think it was great.

05:06:45.580 --> 05:06:51.580
And I support what Nikki said about being able to see the big picture and to see how it lays out regionally in the state.

05:06:51.580 --> 05:06:57.580
I have to personally thank Kristen for the list of acronyms because the feds know them well.

05:06:57.580 --> 05:07:02.580
But when I was reading through the diagram, I said, I think like if you didn't know them, you wouldn't understand them.

05:07:02.580 --> 05:07:04.580
So we got a little side guide here.

05:07:04.580 --> 05:07:07.580
So I thought that might be really helpful.

05:07:07.580 --> 05:07:15.580
Also, I think from where we've been, those of us have been around a while in education to realize where we're going in special ed,

05:07:15.580 --> 05:07:21.580
the idea of needing to train and build capacity, which is what we all know is going to change practice,

05:07:21.580 --> 05:07:29.580
the fact that we're a giant state and the regional level with all the – and I appreciated, Carla, too, for you going through the geo-leads and the self-beliefs

05:07:29.580 --> 05:07:35.580
and what each self-belief is focusing on different and then seeing how that all connects because it's going to take us a while.

05:07:35.580 --> 05:07:38.580
I do believe – and I love the quote, right?

05:07:38.580 --> 05:07:41.580
I believe people are doing the best they can until they know they can do it differently.

05:07:41.580 --> 05:07:47.580
And I would just also thank – I actually got to be at the Katie Novak presentation with an entire district.

05:07:47.580 --> 05:07:52.580
It was pretty amazing because our Katie would be known for high-performing but traditional in their teaching practice,

05:07:52.580 --> 05:07:59.580
and to watch their philosophy change over time and watch principals and teachers begin to embrace a different way of teaching

05:07:59.580 --> 05:08:05.580
and going into classrooms and seeing it really is a great model for what the capacity support's been

05:08:05.580 --> 05:08:09.580
and the ability to invest in the teachers and leaders who do the work.

05:08:09.580 --> 05:08:14.580
So I think we have a lot of work still to do. We know that. We have lots of kids who really need the support.

05:08:14.580 --> 05:08:22.580
But I feel like the plan is very thoughtful. It really addresses what the key issues are and gives us some guidance.

05:08:22.580 --> 05:08:29.580
And we know our target is far bigger. We know we need to do more full inclusion with quality instruction and support.

05:08:29.580 --> 05:08:35.580
But I think this lays a strong foundation. So I just want to thank everyone who was part of this plan.

05:08:35.580 --> 05:08:43.580
Are there clarifying questions before we get to public comment?

05:08:43.580 --> 05:08:47.580
All right. We'll take public comment.

05:08:47.580 --> 05:08:51.580
There's one person signed up for public comment. Andrea Ball.

05:08:51.580 --> 05:08:59.580
Hi. Hello. Is this on? Oh, thank you.

05:08:59.580 --> 05:09:05.580
Andrea Ball here today on behalf of Orange County Department of Education in support of this plan.

05:09:05.580 --> 05:09:11.580
I really want to thank the department and the CCE, Kristen and Carla for all the work.

05:09:11.580 --> 05:09:19.580
The plan is great. You'll see the highlighter of the MTSS work. Orange County Department of Ed has been the lead for a number of years.

05:09:19.580 --> 05:09:25.580
They are partnering with View County and more recently with the UCLA Center for the Transformation of Schools.

05:09:25.580 --> 05:09:31.580
But as I look at the plan, when you see the theory of action for this entire systematic improvement plan,

05:09:31.580 --> 05:09:37.580
and then you look at the bottom of page 10, the description of MTSS, and you probably are all familiar with MTSS,

05:09:37.580 --> 05:09:46.580
it really reflects the saying that because MTSS is not in itself a program or an approach only for students with disabilities,

05:09:46.580 --> 05:09:52.580
it's a framework to improve support for all students. And I think that's what this plan reflects.

05:09:52.580 --> 05:09:57.580
And I just want to thank you, Board Member Sandoval, for your comments,

05:09:57.580 --> 05:10:04.580
because I've been in education policy for about 20 years working at the district, state, and different levels.

05:10:04.580 --> 05:10:12.580
And it's really an exciting time that we're looking at students with disabilities as part of support for all students. Thank you.

05:10:12.580 --> 05:10:19.580
I'd just like to say amen to that. I was reflecting on the fact that when the board, well,

05:10:19.580 --> 05:10:28.580
Mike Christ and I agreed from the CTC and the state board to go out and try to raise some money for the Special Education Task Force,

05:10:28.580 --> 05:10:38.580
which is now like so many years ago, but to see the work that has been done in the meantime to get us toward a unified system of support for students.

05:10:38.580 --> 05:10:44.580
And particularly I want to thank everyone who contributed to the plan

05:10:44.580 --> 05:10:50.580
and the participation of our friends from Arcadia to actually illustrate what it's like when you put it in action.

05:10:50.580 --> 05:10:57.580
It was really very inspiring. Discussion. Yes.

05:10:57.580 --> 05:11:05.580
I just want to highlight, so I'm so impressed with the presentation because it highlights so many things

05:11:05.580 --> 05:11:13.580
that are going well in the system of support when you look at and you hear the example of what was explained.

05:11:13.580 --> 05:11:21.580
It's a perfect example of CDE, CCE, and county offices coming together to really impact local efforts.

05:11:21.580 --> 05:11:28.580
And that's what I think I was hopeful that we envisioned when we were thinking of the system of support.

05:11:28.580 --> 05:11:36.580
And I have to agree with both the comments of Nikki and Eileen around the leadership that Kristen has shown.

05:11:36.580 --> 05:11:42.580
It was special ed that was calling for one system integration before we were talking about one system integration.

05:11:42.580 --> 05:11:48.580
And it was a special ed task force that called out MTSS before people were talking about MTSS.

05:11:48.580 --> 05:11:54.580
So I think we need to just call out and lift up that there's been some incredible leadership

05:11:54.580 --> 05:12:00.580
and collaborative leadership in that field that has helped this state move forward.

05:12:00.580 --> 05:12:09.580
I really think that this sets up the next phase of the work, which is really building our highly qualified educators to do the heavy lifting that's required.

05:12:09.580 --> 05:12:17.580
And I just can't underscore enough and thank Kevin and Kristen and Arcadia for being here as well.

05:12:17.580 --> 05:12:23.580
You are a small team, but the volume of work that it takes to do this,

05:12:23.580 --> 05:12:27.580
the level of collaboration, the resources, the energy.

05:12:27.580 --> 05:12:34.580
And most importantly, what I saw in Arcadia's presentation was the commitment of resources.

05:12:34.580 --> 05:12:42.580
So a lot of districts, when you're bringing a Katie Novak into your district, you're talking about money.

05:12:42.580 --> 05:12:46.580
And a lot of our districts are in a position where they struggle to do that.

05:12:47.580 --> 05:12:54.580
This is an example of breaking those barriers and setting things up to do the right work for students with disabilities.

05:12:54.580 --> 05:12:58.580
So I just want to thank you for lifting all of this, bringing it to light.

05:12:58.580 --> 05:13:01.580
I really appreciate it because it just highlights the efforts.

05:13:01.580 --> 05:13:10.580
And I commend county office work and CDE's work and CCE's work for really showcasing what the one system of support can do.

05:13:17.580 --> 05:13:19.580
Yeah, we've had our public comment.

05:13:19.580 --> 05:13:22.580
We can say anything now.

05:13:22.580 --> 05:13:25.580
Now I can make a speech.

05:13:25.580 --> 05:13:29.580
No, I also want to just commend the work.

05:13:29.580 --> 05:13:30.580
It's obvious.

05:13:30.580 --> 05:13:36.580
One of the things that I noticed today that I haven't seen in a lot of presentations is, you know,

05:13:36.580 --> 05:13:42.580
Kristen and Dr. Carles Estrada and the work and the collaboration between the department and CCE

05:13:42.580 --> 05:13:47.580
and the way that it's exemplified by the work that was presented.

05:13:47.580 --> 05:13:52.580
It is very much something about collaboration and close contact and breaking those silos.

05:13:52.580 --> 05:13:58.580
And I think that's something that we it's really hard to do at the scale of the state of California.

05:13:58.580 --> 05:14:04.580
And so one of the things that as I was the presentation on intersectionality,

05:14:04.580 --> 05:14:11.580
I thought about so many of our students that fall under those categories because the populations mirror so much.

05:14:11.580 --> 05:14:21.580
So you have a number of students, the students of color, I think are 70 percent within the students with disabilities, 17 percent of English learners.

05:14:21.580 --> 05:14:26.580
You spoke about integration, and I think integration period has always been the hardest work, right?

05:14:26.580 --> 05:14:33.580
Because it's either done superficially, tokenized or talked about, but not completely achieved.

05:14:33.580 --> 05:14:37.580
I want to focus a little bit on the else that are part of that 17 percent,

05:14:37.580 --> 05:14:43.580
because I'm wondering what is their identification if it's language and speech.

05:14:43.580 --> 05:14:52.580
And I also want to know how the three way crosswalk is used when you come in and provide technical assistance and support.

05:14:52.580 --> 05:14:58.580
And if you want to tell them about that, I don't know if everyone's familiar with the three way crosswalk that the department it was.

05:14:58.580 --> 05:15:01.580
Was it Veronica with the department put it out?

05:15:01.580 --> 05:15:02.580
Yeah.

05:15:02.580 --> 05:15:14.580
That crosswalks between the roadmap you're talking about and the it's LCFF, the real roadmap and then the special education APR measures.

05:15:14.580 --> 05:15:15.580
And we're happy to provide you all that.

05:15:15.580 --> 05:15:17.580
So you can take a look if you haven't seen that yet.

05:15:17.580 --> 05:15:19.580
But I think you bring up a really valid point.

05:15:19.580 --> 05:15:26.580
And we've been doing a lot of work along with the self leads to really go out and make sure that everyone's aware of the students with disabilities,

05:15:26.580 --> 05:15:32.580
the EL guidelines for students with disabilities and around the data.

05:15:32.580 --> 05:15:36.580
I think it's an area where as a state, now that we have everything in CALPADS,

05:15:36.580 --> 05:15:47.580
we can maybe hopefully have some deeper conversations about how we can help districts further unpack that the overlapping intersectionality data for EL,

05:15:47.580 --> 05:15:52.580
especially because, as you said, where are those connections so that we can really target?

05:15:52.580 --> 05:15:54.580
I think that's where we start in districts.

05:15:54.580 --> 05:15:58.580
I know we do that work when we're working directly with districts is really keep digging,

05:15:58.580 --> 05:16:02.580
keep digging around to see where those root causes come from.

05:16:02.580 --> 05:16:09.580
But, you know, at a statewide level, it'd be great to get to that point as well.

05:16:09.580 --> 05:16:12.580
Member Pagalan.

05:16:12.580 --> 05:16:21.580
I just wanted to say that I really respect in all levels of the presentation, the honesty and, you know, recognizing where we still have to grow.

05:16:21.580 --> 05:16:22.580
I really appreciate that.

05:16:22.580 --> 05:16:28.580
I think it's very easy to just talk about everything that's, you know, that you've done.

05:16:28.580 --> 05:16:29.580
That's amazing.

05:16:29.580 --> 05:16:39.580
But I really, really, truly respect the honesty around where we're heading.

05:16:39.580 --> 05:16:43.580
We can accept a motion if we're ready.

05:16:43.580 --> 05:16:49.580
I move approval of the state systemic improvement plan as proposed by the CDE.

05:16:49.580 --> 05:16:52.580
Second.

05:16:52.580 --> 05:16:54.580
Any further discussion?

05:16:54.580 --> 05:16:55.580
All in favor say aye.

05:16:55.580 --> 05:16:56.580
Aye.

05:16:56.580 --> 05:16:57.580
Any opposed say nay.

05:16:57.580 --> 05:16:59.580
Any abstentions?

05:16:59.580 --> 05:17:00.580
All right.

05:17:00.580 --> 05:17:01.580
Thank you very much.

05:17:01.580 --> 05:17:03.580
Woohoo.

05:17:03.580 --> 05:17:11.580
And if you want to stretch a little, we're going to get our next item is called the mega assessment item.

05:17:11.580 --> 05:17:26.580
And so if that makes you want to take a stretch for one second while our CDE support comes up, but don't go away.

05:17:26.580 --> 05:17:28.580
Okay.

05:17:56.580 --> 05:17:58.580
Thank you.

05:18:26.580 --> 05:18:38.580
Yeah, yeah.

05:18:38.580 --> 05:18:39.580
That makes good sense.

05:18:39.580 --> 05:18:40.580
Okay.

05:18:40.580 --> 05:18:41.580
Okay.

05:18:41.580 --> 05:18:42.580
Don't go far.

05:18:42.580 --> 05:18:45.580
We're going to get going again.

05:18:45.580 --> 05:18:49.580
We have many miles to go before we sleep.

05:18:49.580 --> 05:18:52.580
No, I said you could stretch, not that you could go anywhere.

05:18:52.580 --> 05:18:54.580
Can't go anywhere.

05:18:54.580 --> 05:18:59.580
I'll encourage people to take their individual breaks as they need them.

05:18:59.580 --> 05:19:02.580
We still have several items, so.

05:19:02.580 --> 05:19:12.580
And I know people have whatever planes and trains scheduled for tomorrow.

05:19:12.580 --> 05:19:15.580
Okay.

05:19:15.580 --> 05:19:18.580
Wonderful.

05:19:18.580 --> 05:19:19.580
Sure.

05:19:19.580 --> 05:19:23.580
Yes, that would be awesome.

05:19:23.580 --> 05:19:24.580
That's good.

05:19:24.580 --> 05:19:25.580
Yeah.

05:19:25.580 --> 05:19:26.580
Is this a long one or a short one?

05:19:26.580 --> 05:19:27.580
So I could see myself.

05:19:27.580 --> 05:19:30.580
Are you guys doing something that needs more time or?

05:19:30.580 --> 05:19:31.580
No.

05:19:31.580 --> 05:19:32.580
Okay.

05:19:32.580 --> 05:19:33.580
All right.

05:19:33.580 --> 05:19:36.580
Then we're going to go ahead and get started.

05:19:36.580 --> 05:19:37.580
Okay.

05:19:37.580 --> 05:19:46.580
We're now going to take up, as the room clears out, is so much enthusiasm about the mega assessment item.

05:19:46.580 --> 05:19:48.580
We're excited about it.

05:19:48.580 --> 05:19:52.580
We're now going to take up item seven, our mega assessment item.

05:19:52.580 --> 05:20:01.580
The CDE recommends that the California State Board approve the following contingent on the availability of an appropriation for this purpose.

05:20:01.580 --> 05:20:14.580
The 2019-20 school year per pupil apportionment rates for the CASP tests administered as part of the CASP system as provided in table one of the attachment two.

05:20:14.580 --> 05:20:24.580
The 2019-20 school year per pupil apportionment rates for the LPAC tests administered as provided in table two of attachment two.

05:20:24.580 --> 05:20:33.580
And before I ask the department to begin the presentation for this item, I want to thank the several stakeholders who provided input on this item.

05:20:33.580 --> 05:20:42.580
Among them are letters asking that the state board support a funding request to assist with the implementation of the California next generation science standards.

05:20:42.580 --> 05:20:49.580
There does exist a firewall, such the board does not take positions on legislative proposals.

05:20:49.580 --> 05:21:03.580
Therefore, I do want to encourage the stakeholders who are interested in that to make inquiries before the legislature where those appropriations would be authorized.

05:21:03.580 --> 05:21:07.580
And now let's turn to the department's presentation of this by Mal Vang.

05:21:07.580 --> 05:21:10.580
We're very pleased to have you here and presenting.

05:21:10.580 --> 05:21:12.580
Please begin.

05:21:12.580 --> 05:21:15.580
Good afternoon, Chief Deputy.

05:21:15.580 --> 05:21:17.580
Are your microphones on?

05:21:17.580 --> 05:21:19.580
I don't know. Are they on? Okay.

05:21:19.580 --> 05:21:23.580
President Darlingham and board members, I'm Mal Vang.

05:21:23.580 --> 05:21:28.580
I'm the director for the assessment development and administration division.

05:21:28.580 --> 05:21:34.580
The item before you today is both an action and information item.

05:21:34.580 --> 05:21:38.580
So I would like to start with the action part of the item.

05:21:38.580 --> 05:21:51.580
As you mentioned, the California Department of Education recommends that the California State Board of Education approve and contingent on the availability of an appropriation for this purpose.

05:21:51.580 --> 05:22:16.580
The following the 2019 2020 school year per pupil apportionment rates for the CASP test administer as part of the CASP system as provided in table one of attachment to in this of this item and the 2019 2020 school year per pupil apportionment rates for the English language proficiency assessments for California tests.

05:22:16.580 --> 05:22:21.580
And minister as provided in table two of attachment to of this item.

05:22:21.580 --> 05:22:47.580
So, as you may be aware education code section six zero six four zero one and six zero eight one zero eight three require that the state superintendent of public instruction apportion funds to local educational agencies for the administration of the CASP and LPAC respectively to enable local educational agencies to administer the tests.

05:22:47.580 --> 05:22:53.580
Okay.

05:22:53.580 --> 05:22:57.580
That was my recommendation, I will circle back to that.

05:22:57.580 --> 05:23:11.580
And this table shows the proposed per pupil rates for the test administer as part of CASP, you'll see that you'll have your smarter balanced summative assessments for English language arts and math.

05:23:11.580 --> 05:23:26.580
You get one rate for that assessment, your California science tests, California Spanish assessment, the California alternate assessments for English language arts and math, the California assessment alternate assessment for science.

05:23:26.580 --> 05:23:30.580
There's a grade two diagnostic assessment for ELA and math.

05:23:30.580 --> 05:23:42.580
And then students who do not take the test due to a medical emergency or a parent exemption. There's also an apportionment for that.

05:23:42.580 --> 05:23:49.580
And this slide shows the proposed 2019 2020 LPAC apportionment rates.

05:23:49.580 --> 05:24:03.580
The current initial and summative LPAC apportionment rates is five dollars per pupil as approved by the state board of education in November 2017.

05:24:03.580 --> 05:24:11.580
At this table, the city recommends that the approve the following rate changes for this year.

05:24:11.580 --> 05:24:26.580
An additional 50 cents per pupil to the apportionment rate for the initial LPAC in kindergarten and grade one, and for the summative LPAC in kindergarten through grade two for the one on one administrations.

05:24:26.580 --> 05:24:42.580
And an additional 50 cents for select students who participate in the initial LPAC rotating score validation process, which collects a sample of speaking and writing responses from a percentage of LEAs.

05:24:42.580 --> 05:24:49.580
And a second rating is assigned to validate the scores.

05:24:49.580 --> 05:25:06.580
I will stop at this and see if there are any clarifying questions you may have about the apportionment rates before I move on to the next topic.

05:25:06.580 --> 05:25:14.580
My question is, could you go back to the slide for the first slide on the CASP assessment? Next slide.

05:25:14.580 --> 05:25:31.580
Sure. So on the CASP assessments, which shows the smarter balanced assessments for English language arts and mathematics, when we began our original contract with smarter balance, there was a cap on the number of assessments the state would purchase.

05:25:31.580 --> 05:25:35.580
Is that cap still in place?

05:25:35.580 --> 05:25:43.580
Well, in other words, after that cap, then we would pay for a certain number of assessments up to that cap. Tony is saying yes.

05:25:43.580 --> 05:25:45.580
Yes, that cap is.

05:25:45.580 --> 05:25:46.580
Yes.

05:25:46.580 --> 05:25:49.580
You're talking about our membership.

05:25:49.580 --> 05:25:53.580
Yeah, our membership. So Tony is saying yes, that cap is still in place.

05:25:53.580 --> 05:26:01.580
He knew what I was asking about. I wasn't artful in asking the question. So thank you very much, Tony.

05:26:01.580 --> 05:26:05.580
Any other? OK.

05:26:05.580 --> 05:26:29.580
OK, so this next part, since we released the California science test and the California Spanish assessment results earlier in February, I'd like to go over the statewide results with you so that you have that information as well.

05:26:29.580 --> 05:26:39.580
As a reminder, the California State Board of Education approved the CASP or California science test reporting hierarchy in November of 2017.

05:26:39.580 --> 05:26:56.580
So for the CASP, we have the results are reported at two levels and overall and then by each of the domains, life sciences, physical sciences, earth and space sciences.

05:26:56.580 --> 05:27:09.580
In this slide, remember that students are required to take the California science test in grades five, eight and once in high school in particular in grades 10, 11 or 12.

05:27:09.580 --> 05:27:23.580
So this table shows the grades tested, the scale score ranges for each grade and the mean scale score and the achievement level in which the mean scale score aligns with.

05:27:23.580 --> 05:27:29.580
So there are in terms of the achievement levels, there are four levels similar to the ELA and math.

05:27:29.580 --> 05:27:40.580
We have level one standard not met level two standard nearly met level three standard met and level four standard exceeded.

05:27:40.580 --> 05:27:51.580
So this is for our reference. So in terms of the mean scale score, as you can see, for example, in grade five, the scale score ranges from 150 to 250 about 100 points there.

05:27:51.580 --> 05:28:03.580
And the mean scale score for that grade is 201, which is about the level two in terms of the achievement level.

05:28:03.580 --> 05:28:20.580
So, again, by grade, this is by achievement levels and the number, the percentage of students at each achievement level by grade, roughly around 30% of students met or exceeded standards.

05:28:20.580 --> 05:28:29.580
And with 23, the lower percentage at 23% for grade 10, which is also the grade with the fewest students taking the test.

05:28:29.580 --> 05:28:40.580
As you may remember in high school, they don't they take the recommended to take the science test after their last take science course.

05:28:40.580 --> 05:28:50.580
So some of the students in grade 10, there's fewer students taking it because many students take more science courses throughout their high school years.

05:28:50.580 --> 05:28:58.580
So most students here perform in the standard nearly met level.

05:28:58.580 --> 05:29:06.580
And then as you look at the data, this, this just shows overall the percentage of students at each achievement level by gender.

05:29:06.580 --> 05:29:15.580
The all students category here is provided for our reference. And you may notice that the data looks pretty consistent.

05:29:15.580 --> 05:29:25.580
The achievement across the groups and the standard met and standard exceed is roughly around 30, as I mentioned.

05:29:25.580 --> 05:29:31.580
And then this one is the percentage of students in achievement levels by race or the city.

05:29:31.580 --> 05:29:36.580
Across the four levels look.

05:29:36.580 --> 05:29:43.580
Pretty more very right. It looks pretty varied when you look at the gaps among groups are more apparent.

05:29:43.580 --> 05:29:54.580
As you can see, in terms of the colors here, what I would look at is the all students, as I mentioned, was around 30% met or exceeded standards.

05:29:54.580 --> 05:29:58.580
So if you look at your African-American group, it's at 14%.

05:29:58.580 --> 05:30:03.580
Your American Indian or Alaskan Alaska native, 21%.

05:30:03.580 --> 05:30:09.580
Your Asian group by 59% Filipino group at 45%.

05:30:09.580 --> 05:30:18.580
Your Hawaiian Hispanic or Latino at 19% and your native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander at 21%.

05:30:18.580 --> 05:30:26.580
And your two or more races, sorry, the whites at 44%.

05:30:26.580 --> 05:30:32.580
And then your two or more races at 45% met or exceeded.

05:30:32.580 --> 05:30:43.580
So, as you can see, the gaps among groups is apparent and varied and wide.

05:30:43.580 --> 05:30:59.580
In terms of the percentage of students in each achievement level by program group, you have your English learners are students with disabilities economically disadvantaged migrant education homeless and military.

05:30:59.580 --> 05:31:04.580
These are the groups that we report for federal purposes.

05:31:04.580 --> 05:31:19.580
So we have, again, English language, English learners at 3% students with disabilities at 8% met or exceeded, and they are economically disadvantaged 19%.

05:31:19.580 --> 05:31:29.580
Your migrant education program 12% homeless 15% and military at 30% 33%.

05:31:29.580 --> 05:31:40.580
So, again, the gap is wide and apparent even among programs.

05:31:40.580 --> 05:31:48.580
So, any thoughts I kind of went through that but it probably not any big news to you.

05:31:48.580 --> 05:32:04.580
If you have any clarifying questions you like to say about the cast, otherwise.

05:32:04.580 --> 05:32:09.580
Yes, I have the, I have the CSA.

05:32:09.580 --> 05:32:16.580
So we're going to look at the California Spanish assessment results.

05:32:16.580 --> 05:32:30.580
Again, this is like the first year of operational test for the California Spanish assessment like the science test, and the results are reported at an overall score reporting range for each student.

05:32:30.580 --> 05:32:36.580
And this picture kind of shows the second part of the students report.

05:32:36.580 --> 05:32:49.580
And that show indicates the score reporting range associated with the students overall score. So there's no reporting at the domain level for the Spanish assessment.

05:32:49.580 --> 05:33:02.580
If you look at the range here, the score reporting range indicates that the student can do what the students can do in the area of reading, listening and writing mechanics.

05:33:02.580 --> 05:33:14.580
So this is for our reference that there are those, the California Spanish assessment score reporting ranges by grade or grade span.

05:33:14.580 --> 05:33:35.580
It ranges from, and of course, this shows the Spanish assessment score reported ranges for each grade level and grade band with the associated score reporting range of one, two or three.

05:33:35.580 --> 05:33:41.580
And in terms of the summary, the statewide mean scale scores by grade.

05:33:41.580 --> 05:33:49.580
This slide includes our statewide mean scale score at each grade level, along with the associated score reporting range.

05:33:49.580 --> 05:34:00.580
As you can see, the majority of the grades had a mean score that fell in score reporting one, range one and two.

05:34:00.580 --> 05:34:19.580
So as a reminder, the 2018 19 was the first year of our administration, and these results again may not be much of a surprise to us based on discussions that we had with our educators during our standard setting meeting and throughout the development of this assessment.

05:34:19.580 --> 05:34:30.580
We know that the various bilingual programs are developing or are in the process of being developed.

05:34:30.580 --> 05:34:40.580
So there will be years when before we could really see some additional consistency among programs.

05:34:41.580 --> 05:34:58.580
So at the state level, we'll continue to gather information about the students who are participating on this assessment and then in Spanish instructional programs that they are participating in to make sure that we know that these programs do vary.

05:34:58.580 --> 05:35:11.580
But hopefully over time that there could be some development that's consistent and that the students will receive the instructional programs that will align with the standards in which they're being taught.

05:35:11.580 --> 05:35:17.580
Okay.

05:35:17.580 --> 05:35:30.580
So, any questions.

05:35:30.580 --> 05:35:41.580
I don't have a lot to say I do want to welcome now. So, taking over the work of Michelle center and the assessment division that has done such great work up until this point.

05:35:41.580 --> 05:35:51.580
And, you know, as, as now has presented, you'll see both our cast, the science test and the Spanish assessment test is still in its early stages.

05:35:51.580 --> 05:36:10.580
And, you know, as, as member Strauss said earlier, we put the site, the standards together, the framework, the science materials and all that we're still not getting this quite into the schools yet and you'll see that the results still demonstrate that so we definitely have more work to do in that area.

05:36:10.580 --> 05:36:20.580
And the same with the Spanish assessment as the field kind of understands a little bit more about this and we do have such a variety of students who are taking this test.

05:36:20.580 --> 05:36:30.580
So, it's going to take a little while before it stabilizes a little bit and we can find out more of how these assessments are impacting in the classroom as well.

05:36:30.580 --> 05:36:37.580
So, so that's really all I have for this.

05:36:38.580 --> 05:36:46.580
Any further clarifying questions if not we'll go to public comment and then we'll come back for a deeper dive.

05:36:46.580 --> 05:36:50.580
Oh, you've got another couple more.

05:36:50.580 --> 05:37:01.580
This is very straightforward it's just showing you where to go and where the data is posted, should you like to explore more on our public website.

05:37:01.580 --> 05:37:06.580
And then we're there, and then just the recommendations again.

05:37:06.580 --> 05:37:07.580
Okay.

05:37:07.580 --> 05:37:10.580
And I'm done.

05:37:10.580 --> 05:37:13.580
Yes.

05:37:13.580 --> 05:37:22.580
Yes, we appreciate it and you were being so kind to us and pausing and asking for questions and that was good chunking we appreciate that.

05:37:22.580 --> 05:37:24.580
Are there any public comments.

05:37:24.580 --> 05:37:27.580
We have five speakers for public comment.

05:37:27.580 --> 05:37:46.580
Peter Ahern, Jill Grace, Lisa Higdahl, Jessica Sacco, and Edward Russell Jr.

05:37:46.580 --> 05:37:49.580
President Darlingham and members of the board.

05:37:49.580 --> 05:37:50.580
My name is Peter Ahern.

05:37:50.580 --> 05:37:54.580
I'm president elect of the California Science Teachers Association.

05:37:54.580 --> 05:38:02.580
I'm here in support of the coalition letter that you mentioned earlier and that we've actually revised and just resubmitted.

05:38:02.580 --> 05:38:09.580
We just heard about the results of the first California science test and they're pretty bad.

05:38:09.580 --> 05:38:14.580
And we know from our experience with Common Core math and ELA that these new standards are hard.

05:38:14.580 --> 05:38:21.580
They're difficult shifts for teachers and for students and teachers need support in order to be successful.

05:38:21.580 --> 05:38:33.580
The NGSS were adopted in 2013, instructional materials in 2018, but unlike ELA and math, science received no targeted funding for implementation.

05:38:33.580 --> 05:38:40.580
So we now have an opportunity to correct that and provide targeted funding to support science.

05:38:40.580 --> 05:38:48.580
We will continue to work closely with CDE staff to support NGSS and our commitment to include science on the dashboard in a few years.

05:38:48.580 --> 05:38:53.580
But remember, NGSS has not received funding.

05:38:53.580 --> 05:38:54.580
Thank you very much.

05:38:59.580 --> 05:39:01.580
Good afternoon, President Darlingham and members of the board.

05:39:01.580 --> 05:39:07.580
Dr. Gregson and Jill Grace, the regional director with K-12 Alliance, a STEM program within West Ed.

05:39:07.580 --> 05:39:16.580
And thank you for your leadership with NGSS, having a great framework, instructional materials that we've been able to influence a science assessment.

05:39:16.580 --> 05:39:27.580
We're continuing to revise and we're really proud to work with you and work with CDE on making those things happen in our California NGSS K-8 early implementation initiative.

05:39:27.580 --> 05:39:30.580
We've seen NGSS transform science teaching and learning.

05:39:30.580 --> 05:39:34.580
We work with eight districts and two charters to attempt full implementation.

05:39:34.580 --> 05:39:41.580
And while the initiative is highly successful, our superintendents state that they won't be able to sustain this level of support through their LCAPs.

05:39:41.580 --> 05:39:44.580
They need additional funding to change the system.

05:39:44.580 --> 05:39:47.580
Our science community is equipped and ready to go.

05:39:47.580 --> 05:39:56.580
We have strong, well-trained leadership network ready to take on statewide implementation, but targeted funding is necessary to provide the professional learning to support NGSS.

05:39:56.580 --> 05:40:05.580
The pedagogical shifts that all students should impact all students and provide them access to a high quality science education and close the gaps that Mal mentioned.

05:40:05.580 --> 05:40:07.580
And we're just asking for your leadership with that.

05:40:07.580 --> 05:40:08.580
Thank you.

05:40:08.580 --> 05:40:16.580
Good afternoon, Deputy Superintendent Gregson and President Darling-Hammond and members of the board.

05:40:16.580 --> 05:40:22.580
My name is Lisa Higdahl and I am the science curriculum coach of the Galt Joint Union Elementary School District.

05:40:22.580 --> 05:40:27.580
Galt is one of the districts that has participated in the early implementation initiative.

05:40:27.580 --> 05:40:35.580
Due to the dedicated science funding that was provided by that initiative, we have moved our science education to a level never before experienced in our district.

05:40:35.580 --> 05:40:41.580
We have a district expectation that science will be taught regularly as a core subject in all classrooms.

05:40:41.580 --> 05:40:46.580
Administrative and science leadership supporting instruction that embraces the NGSS pedagogical shifts.

05:40:46.580 --> 05:40:59.580
Students using the science and engineering practices in multiple disciplines and an increase in field studies and habitat restoration projects for all with strong connections to NGSS in the environmental principles and concepts.

05:40:59.580 --> 05:41:08.580
To continue that growth, this district and all districts will need the support of dedicated state funding for NGSS as requested by CSTA.

05:41:08.580 --> 05:41:12.580
Thank you.

05:41:12.580 --> 05:41:17.580
Good afternoon, Jessica Sacco on behalf of the California STEM Network, a project of Children Now.

05:41:17.580 --> 05:41:24.580
I'd like to start out by thanking members Ortiz, Lincoln and Sandoval for their service and we will miss you.

05:41:24.580 --> 05:41:29.580
Welcome Deputy Superintendent Gregson to her new role. Congratulations as well as the new director, Mal Vang.

05:41:29.580 --> 05:41:34.580
We have worked with Mal for years and we're really excited for her and connecting with her on the assessments.

05:41:34.580 --> 05:41:37.580
I do want to thank you.

05:41:37.580 --> 05:41:39.580
I do want to connect some of our comments.

05:41:39.580 --> 05:41:53.580
We do recognize that there are restrictions and you know, orders of things in place that when it comes to talking about funding for standards implementation, we're just simply grateful to board members as they participate in their liaison experiences,

05:41:53.580 --> 05:42:05.580
as they are instructional and educational leaders in the community that they continue to keep science at the forefront of their mind and recognize the heavy lift and the needed investment that is required for those standards.

05:42:05.580 --> 05:42:07.580
Thank you.

05:42:07.580 --> 05:42:09.580
Thank you very much.

05:42:09.580 --> 05:42:11.580
Any other public comment?

05:42:11.580 --> 05:42:23.580
Okay, I will note that the governor's proposed budget does include something on the order of 90 or 100 million dollars for STEM professional development, including NGSS implementation.

05:42:23.580 --> 05:42:29.580
So we will watch that on its way through the legislature with our fingers crossed.

05:42:29.580 --> 05:42:37.580
And then just to clarify, President Darling-Hammond, and if that money goes through, then we'll be able to help guide how that is allocated.

05:42:37.580 --> 05:42:39.580
Is that right?

05:42:39.580 --> 05:42:41.580
No?

05:42:41.580 --> 05:42:46.580
Thank you.

05:42:46.580 --> 05:42:53.580
We are now open for discussion, but not that topic.

05:42:53.580 --> 05:42:56.580
Yes, member Ortiz-Lacone.

05:42:56.580 --> 05:43:00.580
Well, not that topic, but just closely related.

05:43:00.580 --> 05:43:08.580
You know, I'm looking at the percentage, the caste percentages by student, specifically race and ethnicity.

05:43:08.580 --> 05:43:14.580
And though I know the numbers, it's still always shocking to see them in front of you.

05:43:14.580 --> 05:43:25.580
And I do agree with board member San that it's early, it's the first year, the, you know, the training, the resources, the materials have not necessarily trickled down.

05:43:25.580 --> 05:43:28.580
But it's working for some students, right?

05:43:28.580 --> 05:43:29.580
You could see it there.

05:43:29.580 --> 05:43:33.580
There are some students that despite all that, they're doing quite well.

05:43:33.580 --> 05:43:45.580
And so I think that, yes, we need to give it some time, but I'm concerned that the time we're giving it is only at the cost of some students, right?

05:43:45.580 --> 05:43:46.580
And that's for everything.

05:43:46.580 --> 05:43:49.580
If you look at ELA and math, we still have that conversation.

05:43:49.580 --> 05:43:51.580
We need to give it some time.

05:43:51.580 --> 05:44:11.580
So I'm wondering what from the department side, I know that there were some conversations about possible funding, but what are we doing on the department side to provide support as we're hoping to increase these numbers next year with or this year when the new administration of the assessments given?

05:44:11.580 --> 05:44:18.580
What are we given in terms of guidance, support, training, whatever it is?

05:44:18.580 --> 05:44:20.580
Would you like me to speak to that?

05:44:20.580 --> 05:44:21.580
Sure.

05:44:21.580 --> 05:44:24.580
So we've got a couple of things happening right now.

05:44:24.580 --> 05:44:31.580
Mal and her team are looking at we've been requesting money to support kind of a 3D module.

05:44:31.580 --> 05:44:38.580
So it's professional learning resources for teachers and resources for students that are all based on California and GSS.

05:44:38.580 --> 05:44:42.580
We also have our quite comprehensive California science framework.

05:44:42.580 --> 05:45:01.580
And so I think we have to go back to providing more professional learning around the California science framework because it's the document that every single teacher can have for free in their classroom and utilize in their department meetings, their grade level meetings, their school meetings, provide with professional learning for administrators.

05:45:01.580 --> 05:45:02.580
So we have those elements.

05:45:02.580 --> 05:45:14.580
We're also looking at developing out some of our performance tasks that are in GSS based so that our teachers can understand how to incorporate performance tasks embedded in their instructions.

05:45:14.580 --> 05:45:22.580
We've got a multi layered approach, but we know that we need more professional learning to saturate across the state for our teachers.

05:45:22.580 --> 05:45:34.580
And also we have our science collaboration community as well, who's working on this as well throughout regional projects and trying to get saturated down to the classroom teacher.

05:45:34.580 --> 05:45:49.580
And what I'm thinking is when you think about exposure teaching and then you look at careers in STEM, when you look at, for instance, a Latino population in STEM careers, we're 10% and 3% for Latinas.

05:45:49.580 --> 05:45:54.580
And so courses like this will eventually lead to the workforce.

05:45:54.580 --> 05:46:00.580
And for some of it, for some of us, it will have real implications.

05:46:01.580 --> 05:46:03.580
Member Rucker.

05:46:03.580 --> 05:46:20.580
So I agree with board member Lincoln, Ortiz Lincoln, that the performance gap of students by ethnicity or by these subgroups is stark, but it's not surprising.

05:46:20.580 --> 05:46:29.580
And I guess the fact that it's not surprising takes me back to the conversation when we were approving the new LCAP template.

05:46:29.580 --> 05:46:50.580
One of the concerns that was raised by a number of stakeholder groups is that districts are not being given enough guidance or that the guidance doesn't contain a sufficient mandate to make sure that what districts prioritize or plan for in their LCAPs truly addresses the needs of students.

05:46:50.580 --> 05:47:03.580
And so and then I'm also sensitive to and remembering the state's audit report pointing out that it's not clear that districts are actually spending their supplemental and concentration grant funds on their students.

05:47:03.580 --> 05:47:25.580
So I see these test scores and it makes me go back to wonder, so how is the planning that schools are actually doing actually data driven when every single time we implement a new assessment, the same students clearly are not being served well.

05:47:25.580 --> 05:47:37.580
There needs to be a point in time where we start seeing some differences when the same students are performing well and are obviously succeeding and benefiting from the instructional program.

05:47:37.580 --> 05:47:48.580
And nothing the data keeps saying, regardless of what subject area the assessment is for, the data continues to say the same students are not being served.

05:47:49.580 --> 05:47:59.580
It's easy to blame the test. It's easy to wait for your presentation and look at data that verifies what we already know is going on.

05:47:59.580 --> 05:48:14.580
But at some point in time, our accountability concerns about continuous improvement and the work that should be going on should say or should show in some way returning a corner.

05:48:14.580 --> 05:48:22.580
I mean I understand, I mean this brings back to me the reasons why Martin Luther King urgently said there are reasons why we can't wait.

05:48:22.580 --> 05:48:33.580
You know, when we implement the next assessment that people are pushing for and the gap still looks the same, it still says the plan is not working for somebody.

05:48:33.580 --> 05:48:40.580
So while I'm happy to focus on the continuous improvement, the plan is not working for somebody.

05:48:40.580 --> 05:48:53.580
So I believe in and I accept what some of our stakeholders said, while the law may not create a mandate for how we can direct districts on what they write about in their plan,

05:48:53.580 --> 05:49:10.580
I still think, and this data shows, we need to give county offices more guidance to speak with on how to talk to districts about the planning they are doing and how to use the data to do better and effective planning.

05:49:10.580 --> 05:49:28.580
Because it's irresponsible to blame the test or say that there's something wrong with the test when every single test is showing there's something wrong with the planning and the system.

05:49:28.580 --> 05:49:37.580
Yeah, so I wanted to mention, it is important to note that we are in the early stages of this test, but it was very alarming to see those results.

05:49:37.580 --> 05:49:47.580
And for me specifically, the STEM careers are the ones that are the most fast evolving careers.

05:49:47.580 --> 05:49:58.580
And if we're not fast on this, as fast as those jobs are evolving, then the same groups of people that were left behind in the past are going to be left behind in the future.

05:49:58.580 --> 05:50:15.580
So I really hope this can be prioritized because moving forward with the kind of jobs that are growing, this is going to be essential and STEM careers should be the main focus for students who are in the education system right now.

05:50:16.580 --> 05:50:25.580
The comments from my colleagues bring a question up for me then in our system of support that we just talked about.

05:50:25.580 --> 05:50:43.580
How much of that when we're going into districts and supporting schools that have been identified based on current dashboard indicators, how much is that support spread beyond let's say content areas that that are not necessarily on the dashboard yet.

05:50:43.580 --> 05:50:59.580
And it would be helpful that when we look at comprehensive support that, yes, while the dashboard gives us data and schools may have been identified based on dashboard, that there are systemic issues within districts and schools that need to be addressed.

05:50:59.580 --> 05:51:09.580
And perhaps that could support other areas as well, not just in that specific content area or specific student population.

05:51:09.580 --> 05:51:14.580
Do you like me to say something to that?

05:51:14.580 --> 05:51:24.580
So as far as the system of support and our counties working directly with our districts to really understand what are the barriers that are impeding student success.

05:51:24.580 --> 05:51:34.580
So the reasons why they're eligible for differentiated assistance and let's remember that a district is eligible for differentiated assistance under two different priorities, right?

05:51:34.580 --> 05:51:38.580
And not being able to serve student subgroups within those two priorities.

05:51:38.580 --> 05:51:43.580
So when they're doing the root cause analysis, they are looking at multiple pieces of data.

05:51:43.580 --> 05:51:53.580
They're looking at all of their achievement data, not only ELA and math, but curriculum embedded assessments in all of the content areas because it's not just ELA and math, right?

05:51:53.580 --> 05:51:59.580
Those are symptomatic of the other content issues, other issues in content areas.

05:51:59.580 --> 05:52:13.580
So they're looking at their system of professional learning for their teachers, the type of instructional resources their teachers are using in the classroom, and then what type of learning environment that they've created within the classroom for their students as well.

05:52:13.580 --> 05:52:22.580
So they're looking at all of those different layers to then determine, OK, what are your issues and how do we fix them?

05:52:22.580 --> 05:52:34.580
So it's not just looking at those singular pieces of data, it's multiple pieces of data.

05:52:34.580 --> 05:52:40.580
You know, you need a motion on the per pupil apportionment rates.

05:52:40.580 --> 05:52:41.580
Do I hear a motion?

05:52:41.580 --> 05:52:46.580
OK, so I will make the motion, but can I just ask something related to this?

05:52:46.580 --> 05:52:50.580
Not really directly to this item, but it's kind of associated with it.

05:52:50.580 --> 05:52:54.580
We all know coronavirus schools closing.

05:52:54.580 --> 05:52:56.580
It's right around testing time.

05:52:56.580 --> 05:53:03.580
Now, if you could just maybe talk a little bit about the department's guidance to schools.

05:53:03.580 --> 05:53:05.580
If they chose to close, what's this?

05:53:05.580 --> 05:53:09.580
Has there been something out there regarding?

05:53:09.580 --> 05:53:12.580
Could we come back to that maybe after the motion?

05:53:12.580 --> 05:53:14.580
Do you think this influences our vote?

05:53:14.580 --> 05:53:17.580
Well, we can come back after the motion.

05:53:17.580 --> 05:53:22.580
Yeah.

05:53:22.580 --> 05:53:27.580
Yes, we did work with our communications office to put out some communications last week.

05:53:27.580 --> 05:53:36.580
And we also work with our contractor to ensure that if schools close or are contemplating closing,

05:53:36.580 --> 05:53:42.580
that they reach out to our contractor and they will work with them within our testing window.

05:53:42.580 --> 05:53:44.580
We have a wide testing window for CASP.

05:53:44.580 --> 05:53:48.580
It opens on January 14th and ends on July 15th.

05:53:48.580 --> 05:53:56.580
So if they are open within those times, their instructional years within that span of time,

05:53:56.580 --> 05:54:01.580
they could adjust their calendar or testing windows with our contractor.

05:54:01.580 --> 05:54:05.580
There are various options on the table.

05:54:05.580 --> 05:54:09.580
I think that we're supposed to hear some guidance from the feds.

05:54:10.580 --> 05:54:14.580
I heard through the grapevine, so don't quote me on that about this very issue.

05:54:14.580 --> 05:54:26.580
So once we get some guidance from the feds, it's just that we're going to get some updates from them, some guidance from them.

05:54:26.580 --> 05:54:31.580
I'm sorry to burst the bubble, but that's really it.

05:54:31.580 --> 05:54:40.580
As the issues and concerns are coming up around COVID-19 and how this is affecting our testing windows and the school closures,

05:54:40.580 --> 05:54:49.580
we are constantly working with our Department of Public Health and reaching out to Cal OES and then the federal government as well to update our guidance as we learn more.

05:54:49.580 --> 05:54:55.580
It is literally and our Deputy Superintendent Lisa Constanza can speak to this every hour.

05:54:55.580 --> 05:54:58.580
It's something new and different that we're addressing.

05:54:58.580 --> 05:55:02.580
So we were kind of the hub of all that and completely understand that.

05:55:02.580 --> 05:55:09.580
Just want to make sure our contractors have that capacity to deal with the changes and fluctuations and all that.

05:55:09.580 --> 05:55:12.580
And we just want to be supportive of that. Yes, they do have the capacity.

05:55:12.580 --> 05:55:17.580
And in fact, we've already reached out to a few within this week.

05:55:17.580 --> 05:55:24.580
And because most of our tests are online now, it's a lot easier to do that kind of adjustment.

05:55:24.580 --> 05:55:26.580
OK, great. Thank you.

05:55:26.580 --> 05:55:37.580
All right. So I will make a motion to the department's recommendation to approve the apportionment rates for the CASA tests administered,

05:55:37.580 --> 05:55:52.580
provided in the attachments one and two of the item and the per pupil apportionment rates for the LPAC tests administered as provided on table two of the attachment two of the item.

05:55:52.580 --> 05:55:55.580
Right. Any further discussion?

05:55:55.580 --> 05:55:59.580
All in favor say aye. Any opposed nay.

05:55:59.580 --> 05:56:01.580
Any abstentions? Motion passes.

05:56:01.580 --> 05:56:04.580
Thank you very much.

05:56:04.580 --> 05:56:09.580
You. Well, I'm not done yet.

05:56:09.580 --> 05:56:10.580
I'm not done yet.

05:56:10.580 --> 05:56:19.580
Hopefully we do the right ahead to the Golden State seal merit diploma, after which we'll take a break before we do the waivers.

05:56:19.580 --> 05:56:34.580
So in this item, the CD recommends that the state board approve the Golden State seal merit diploma eligibility criteria specified in attachment one,

05:56:34.580 --> 05:56:46.580
which updates the criteria for students to demonstrate mastery of science curriculum using the California Science Test Results to award the GSMD for graduating students effective March 2020.

05:56:46.580 --> 05:56:51.580
And Malvang will present. Please begin.

05:56:51.580 --> 05:56:56.580
Thank you, President Darlene Hammond.

05:56:56.580 --> 05:57:01.580
The item before you today is both an action information item.

05:57:01.580 --> 05:57:14.580
The California Department of Education recommends that the state board of the California State Board of Education approve the following eligibility criteria for the Golden State seal merit diploma specified in attachment one,

05:57:14.580 --> 05:57:29.580
and including the updates to the criteria for demonstrating a demonstration of science curriculum mastery to include the California Science Test Results to award the Golden State seal merit diploma to graduating students.

05:57:29.580 --> 05:57:49.580
So per Education Code sections five one four five zero through five five, each local educational agency that confers high school diplomas are required to maintain appropriate records in order to annually identify graduating seniors who have earned a Golden State seal merit diploma.

05:57:49.580 --> 05:57:56.580
And to affix the insignia to the diploma and transcript of each qualifying student.

05:57:56.580 --> 05:58:10.580
So the revised eligibility reflect the current availability of our state assessment results and include the following changes, as I mentioned, to add the use of the CAS results earned in grade 10 or 11 for the category of science.

05:58:10.580 --> 05:58:23.580
And although some students may not take the cast until grade 12, they have had reasonable access to meet the science criteria using our course and the course grade option.

05:58:23.580 --> 05:58:29.580
And there's our recommendation.

05:58:29.580 --> 05:58:33.580
That's it. I only have that slide.

05:58:33.580 --> 05:58:37.580
Do this in two minutes. No graphic.

05:58:37.580 --> 05:58:44.580
Are there any clarifying questions about this? Yes, member birth.

05:58:44.580 --> 05:58:49.580
Thank you, Mel. I just want to make sure that on the criteria.

05:58:49.580 --> 05:59:08.580
The item number four, where it allows for two additional subject areas that students can choose from that my understanding is correct that where B is a grade of B or numerical equivalent or above upon the completion of high school courses in other subjects.

05:59:08.580 --> 05:59:18.580
That includes visual and performing arts, foreign language, because we have such an emphasis, at least up in the top on what I'm going to call the core subjects.

05:59:18.580 --> 05:59:27.580
But as you know, those other areas are available for complete for completing graduation requirements.

05:59:27.580 --> 05:59:36.580
So I just wanted to clarify that we're not just focused on the core subjects that are shown up there that have tests that go along with them.

05:59:36.580 --> 05:59:41.580
You're right. Are you talking about five B? Yes.

05:59:41.580 --> 05:59:46.580
Completion of in other subjects.

05:59:46.580 --> 06:00:03.580
Or could it be career tech and we spent all morning talking about career technical courses and there's such an emphasis here on what our quote traditional subjects and I know this grew out of years and years ago, the Golden State exams when these were all test based and they were all very specific content area.

06:00:03.580 --> 06:00:08.580
But I hope that we're taking a broader view and I just want to make sure that's what we're voting on.

06:00:08.580 --> 06:00:24.580
I believe in five B and C, it does leave that local decision for the for the LEA to make the decision of which additional courses in other subjects beyond the ones that are listed from one through four.

06:00:24.580 --> 06:00:30.580
So that is my understanding, but I don't know if I have any.

06:00:30.580 --> 06:00:35.580
Do you need to phone a friend?

06:00:35.580 --> 06:00:56.580
Done. Yes.

06:00:56.580 --> 06:01:02.580
Okay.

06:01:02.580 --> 06:01:08.580
What is it?

06:01:08.580 --> 06:01:12.580
Yeah, I was going to text somebody, but would you like me to follow up with you?

06:01:12.580 --> 06:01:14.580
Okay.

06:01:14.580 --> 06:01:17.580
Oh, okay. Sure. Sure thing.

06:01:17.580 --> 06:01:22.580
We'll let you get your text off and then we'll go to member rocker and then we'll go to member son.

06:01:22.580 --> 06:01:29.580
And but we'll let let you get that answer moving.

06:01:29.580 --> 06:01:44.580
And did I miss anybody else who wants to get in?

06:01:44.580 --> 06:01:47.580
Are you ready?

06:01:47.580 --> 06:01:54.580
Well, I'm trying to not ask her to multitask too much.

06:01:54.580 --> 06:02:02.580
I think she's got somebody who's going to research it.

06:02:02.580 --> 06:02:06.580
Okay, so somebody working on it now.

06:02:06.580 --> 06:02:10.580
Okay, so we have another question for you now.

06:02:10.580 --> 06:02:13.580
Well, I was actually going to attempt to respond to board.

06:02:13.580 --> 06:02:18.580
Oh, I see.

06:02:18.580 --> 06:02:26.580
It said because the students are being allowed to choose the fifth way or the other to meet another way to meet the fifth criteria.

06:02:26.580 --> 06:02:39.580
When we were working on this, there was a lot of conversation about making sure that we were including elective courses like the arts as well as career and technical education courses.

06:02:39.580 --> 06:02:42.580
And that was the purpose of B and C.

06:02:42.580 --> 06:02:57.580
C in particular was intended for students who took capstone courses or earned badges for career and technical education programs so that they had another way of offering how they met the requirement.

06:02:57.580 --> 06:03:11.580
And so it was intended to include the full spectrum of what's on a student's master schedule or school plan for meeting their local graduation requirements that encompassed all of their courses.

06:03:11.580 --> 06:03:14.580
That was what was behind B and C.

06:03:14.580 --> 06:03:17.580
And at the time, there was a lot of conversation about A.

06:03:17.580 --> 06:03:23.580
It seemed like A was duplicative of what was already encompassed in one, two, three, and four.

06:03:23.580 --> 06:03:29.580
And so that's the reason why B and C were broken out and narrated or explained in that way.

06:03:29.580 --> 06:03:40.580
So the answer that should be coming back is yes, it does include all electives, regardless of subject area, as well as career and technical education.

06:03:40.580 --> 06:03:44.580
And I've completed this form a number of times from the LEA.

06:03:44.580 --> 06:03:49.580
And that's my recollection, too, but I want to confirm before with my own staff.

06:03:49.580 --> 06:03:53.580
So we'll wait for a little more confirmation, but then we can go on to member Sun is waiting.

06:03:53.580 --> 06:03:55.580
Anyone else who was waiting?

06:03:55.580 --> 06:04:06.580
Yeah. And having done this at the site level has been many years and I've been directly involved, but I believe that is the case that you can select the additional is up to the LEA.

06:04:06.580 --> 06:04:10.580
But this does bring me to my soapbox about this particular item.

06:04:10.580 --> 06:04:16.580
I am going to recommend approval because the recommendation is sound.

06:04:16.580 --> 06:04:26.580
It is consistent with what we have been doing under the Golden Seal merit diploma and within the confines of the Ed code that is there currently.

06:04:26.580 --> 06:04:33.580
I do think that this the overall Golden State seal has gone through quite a bit of evolution.

06:04:33.580 --> 06:04:40.580
And I've questioned every time this item has come up, why what what is this now for?

06:04:40.580 --> 06:04:46.580
Because it was originally, as member Burr said, the the Golden State tests.

06:04:46.580 --> 06:04:50.580
And that was prior to when we'd had state tests.

06:04:50.580 --> 06:04:59.580
And so is a way of earning this diploma based on some objective criteria that is out there and consistent across the board.

06:05:00.580 --> 06:05:03.580
Then we didn't have tests for a while, so we went to this grading system.

06:05:03.580 --> 06:05:12.580
Then we started tests again and then we started adding the current current assessments into a mixture of grades and all that.

06:05:12.580 --> 06:05:15.580
So it's evolved really quite a bit.

06:05:15.580 --> 06:05:20.580
And I guess I still question what is for as long as it's in the Ed code.

06:05:20.580 --> 06:05:26.580
I know that we still have this program, but I just I I'm not sure.

06:05:26.580 --> 06:05:34.580
You know, we will continue building this, but I don't I don't have clarity on what the actual goal of the Golden State seal of merit diploma is.

06:05:37.580 --> 06:05:43.580
Yeah. What do you get out of the Golden State seal merit diploma?

06:05:47.580 --> 06:05:50.580
I think it's a good point.

06:05:50.580 --> 06:05:53.580
I mean, you get it.

06:05:53.580 --> 06:05:58.580
Yeah, OK.

06:05:58.580 --> 06:06:01.580
Yeah, so so I that is the question.

06:06:01.580 --> 06:06:03.580
But again, yeah, this is one of those questions.

06:06:03.580 --> 06:06:04.580
Yeah, it is a bigger question.

06:06:04.580 --> 06:06:06.580
But I will support the recommendation.

06:06:06.580 --> 06:06:10.580
I just think that we put a lot of time in building something that we're not really sure the purpose of.

06:06:10.580 --> 06:06:12.580
That's all.

06:06:12.580 --> 06:06:15.580
Well, you know, it had a purpose at an earlier moment in time, right?

06:06:15.580 --> 06:06:17.580
That was a bigger, broader.

06:06:17.580 --> 06:06:20.580
But sometimes we need to look at how things evolve and we need to make things go away.

06:06:21.580 --> 06:06:30.580
Well, you know, and I have having gone to a number of high school graduations, my own and then many, many others since then.

06:06:30.580 --> 06:06:37.580
You know, these awards mean more to the school giving them often than it does to the students receiving them.

06:06:37.580 --> 06:06:45.580
And a lot of times also, it also means a lot to the students who watch their peers and friends receive those awards.

06:06:45.580 --> 06:06:48.580
And many schools think that it's motivating.

06:06:48.580 --> 06:07:02.580
But I think that the purpose of giving these programs, these awards is more hype and more self self aggrandizement for the school and the school program.

06:07:02.580 --> 06:07:15.580
And so while I think it's important later on when students are all grown up and they're looking back on this and they're trying to figure out ways to motivate their own children.

06:07:15.580 --> 06:07:25.580
You know, because I'm looking at board members who have young children and, you know, I have often made the mistake of telling my godchildren, pay attention.

06:07:25.580 --> 06:07:27.580
It's going to be on the test.

06:07:27.580 --> 06:07:29.580
Now I'm telling them, pay attention.

06:07:29.580 --> 06:07:32.580
I want you to get one of these awards that I'm approving.

06:07:32.580 --> 06:07:35.580
So I think no, it is.

06:07:35.580 --> 06:07:38.580
I told I told all of them I want to get that foreign language award.

06:07:38.580 --> 06:07:42.580
I want them all to get that one because I thought, you know, because they're African American.

06:07:42.580 --> 06:07:46.580
We barely, you know, in my family, English is our second language because we're all from the south.

06:07:46.580 --> 06:07:47.580
So it's important.

06:07:47.580 --> 06:07:49.580
It is important for a reason.

06:07:49.580 --> 06:08:05.580
But I think the generation where we were into that badging and earning those badges, this is a holdover from that time when we weren't so focused on assessments.

06:08:05.580 --> 06:08:21.580
We weren't so focused on just simply graduating but doing something that that high school graduation was a mile marker and an important accomplishment that meant many things to that particular generation.

06:08:21.580 --> 06:08:27.580
So some of this awarding and this particular idea is a holdover from that.

06:08:27.580 --> 06:08:32.580
And I think it's an opportunity for us as we sit and question the value of it.

06:08:32.580 --> 06:08:37.580
And we have a student member who obviously is going to receive one of these awards.

06:08:37.580 --> 06:08:45.580
It's an opportunity for us to think about what it is we're trying to tell both our parents, our school community and our L.A.

06:08:45.580 --> 06:08:55.580
as they prepare this spring to award these and identify students, what it is we really want them to say and help students understand about receiving it.

06:08:55.580 --> 06:08:59.580
And so I think we've got an answer to the we have an answer.

06:08:59.580 --> 06:09:03.580
So it can be any course a district wants to include.

06:09:03.580 --> 06:09:11.580
The trend has been toward even PE courses and performing arts.

06:09:11.580 --> 06:09:13.580
All right.

06:09:13.580 --> 06:09:16.580
Can we move forward on the item?

06:09:16.580 --> 06:09:20.580
Yeah, and yeah, we're just going to just comment on member Rutgers point.

06:09:20.580 --> 06:09:32.580
I mean, this is also the criteria is agreed B plus for one single mathematics or you could say ELA for the entire four years or three years.

06:09:32.580 --> 06:09:44.580
So in a course, so you could make Cs or Ds as long as in one year, there was a B plus in that year and that one subject area.

06:09:44.580 --> 06:09:54.580
So it's a criteria is not what I considered so high that it's so again, it goes back to we established this criteria.

06:09:54.580 --> 06:09:56.580
What is the purpose of it?

06:09:56.580 --> 06:10:00.580
And and again, it's maybe we want to put this on a future agenda.

06:10:00.580 --> 06:10:03.580
Well, yeah, I've asked about that.

06:10:03.580 --> 06:10:10.580
I mean, to really discuss to discuss what exactly because right now we have people waiting to get this.

06:10:10.580 --> 06:10:14.580
OK, some of our own diets.

06:10:14.580 --> 06:10:16.580
So you did you want to move?

06:10:16.580 --> 06:10:19.580
I can move the item.

06:10:19.580 --> 06:10:22.580
Yes, you put it that way.

06:10:22.580 --> 06:10:23.580
I'll second it.

06:10:23.580 --> 06:10:24.580
OK.

06:10:24.580 --> 06:10:25.580
All right.

06:10:25.580 --> 06:10:27.580
We have a motion and a second.

06:10:27.580 --> 06:10:32.580
I don't even want to ask if there's further discussion.

06:10:32.580 --> 06:10:33.580
All in favor say aye.

06:10:33.580 --> 06:10:34.580
Aye.

06:10:34.580 --> 06:10:36.580
Any opposed say nay.

06:10:36.580 --> 06:10:38.580
Any abstentions?

06:10:38.580 --> 06:10:47.580
The motion carries that we will come back and talk about our broader purposes for this at a moment in time where people are not in the middle of earning it.

06:10:47.580 --> 06:10:48.580
OK.

06:10:48.580 --> 06:10:49.580
Thank you very much, Mal.

06:10:49.580 --> 06:10:50.580
We appreciate it.

06:10:50.580 --> 06:10:53.580
And we're going to take a brief break till four.

06:10:53.580 --> 06:10:59.580
OK, we'll let people actually get their cup of coffee and get to the restroom and then we'll come back and do waivers.

06:11:02.580 --> 06:11:08.580
Can I call the meeting back to order?

06:11:08.580 --> 06:11:18.580
So we're going to go to waiver consent and we're going to take up waiver consent items W1 to W12.

06:11:18.580 --> 06:11:23.580
I understand there's a correction to the proposed term for W11.

06:11:23.580 --> 06:11:26.580
So Christian Wright's going to clarify W11.

06:11:27.580 --> 06:11:28.580
Yes.

06:11:28.580 --> 06:11:47.580
So for item 11, waiver item 11, the CDE recommends that the state board approve the nonpublic school student placement outlined in waiver 11 and our rationale for the change in the item versus what was posted to align the necessary start and end dates for the school year.

06:11:47.580 --> 06:11:53.580
Because the way we certify is by calendar year, which is different.

06:11:53.580 --> 06:11:57.580
And so we just don't want to we want to make sure that we have everyone covered.

06:11:57.580 --> 06:12:03.580
So the clarifying the correction is that we want to be sure that there's not a lapse in coverage for the student in the school.

06:12:03.580 --> 06:12:12.580
So the clarification is that you approve the waiver and that there's a change in the timeline.

06:12:12.580 --> 06:12:14.580
Okay.

06:12:14.580 --> 06:12:15.580
To the dates.

06:12:15.580 --> 06:12:16.580
Yeah.

06:12:16.580 --> 06:12:18.580
Oh, thank you.

06:12:18.580 --> 06:12:23.580
So the new date will be December 11th, 2019 to June 30th, 2020.

06:12:23.580 --> 06:12:24.580
I'm sorry.

06:12:24.580 --> 06:12:27.580
July 1st, 2021 to get them over the hump.

06:12:27.580 --> 06:12:30.580
So thank you for clarifying that.

06:12:30.580 --> 06:12:35.580
So now I have, is there any public comment on waiver W1 through W12?

06:12:35.580 --> 06:12:37.580
There's no one signed up for public comment.

06:12:37.580 --> 06:12:38.580
No one.

06:12:38.580 --> 06:12:39.580
Okay.

06:12:39.580 --> 06:12:40.580
Okay.

06:12:40.580 --> 06:12:43.580
So do we have a motion?

06:12:43.580 --> 06:12:51.580
I will move the consent on the waivers.

06:12:51.580 --> 06:12:52.580
We have a motion.

06:12:52.580 --> 06:12:55.580
Do we have a second?

06:12:55.580 --> 06:12:56.580
Member Ver?

06:12:56.580 --> 06:12:57.580
Thank you.

06:12:57.580 --> 06:12:59.580
Any discussion?

06:12:59.580 --> 06:13:03.580
Just to clarify that there is a correction to W11.

06:13:03.580 --> 06:13:08.580
So with that, do we have approval of the motion to approve the waiver consent?

06:13:08.580 --> 06:13:09.580
All those in favor?

06:13:09.580 --> 06:13:10.580
Yes.

06:13:10.580 --> 06:13:11.580
Aye.

06:13:11.580 --> 06:13:12.580
Thank you.

06:13:12.580 --> 06:13:13.580
Motion carries.

06:13:13.580 --> 06:13:15.580
So we're going to do state board priorities now.

06:13:15.580 --> 06:13:22.580
The first thing we're going to do is we need to approve the preliminary report of actions

06:13:22.580 --> 06:13:25.580
and minutes for the January 8th and 9th meeting.

06:13:25.580 --> 06:13:30.580
Do I have a motion to approve the minutes from the January board meeting?

06:13:30.580 --> 06:13:32.580
I'll move.

06:13:32.580 --> 06:13:33.580
Member Sandoval moved?

06:13:33.580 --> 06:13:34.580
I'll second.

06:13:34.580 --> 06:13:36.580
And Member Sung seconded.

06:13:37.580 --> 06:13:38.580
Any discussion?

06:13:38.580 --> 06:13:40.580
All those in favor?

06:13:40.580 --> 06:13:41.580
Say aye.

06:13:41.580 --> 06:13:42.580
Aye.

06:13:42.580 --> 06:13:43.580
Any opposed?

06:13:43.580 --> 06:13:47.580
The motion carries and minutes are approved.

06:13:55.580 --> 06:13:56.580
All right.

06:13:56.580 --> 06:14:03.580
So what we're going to do now is to go over our liaison reports.

06:14:03.580 --> 06:14:07.580
We're going to go in reverse alphabetical order, but I'll go at the end.

06:14:07.580 --> 06:14:11.580
So Sue, you'll be toward the end and Ting, you're going to be at the beginning.

06:14:11.580 --> 06:14:17.580
So we'll just call each of the board members and please report on your liaison activities

06:14:17.580 --> 06:14:20.580
related to items that we're working on.

06:14:20.580 --> 06:14:21.580
Okay.

06:14:21.580 --> 06:14:22.580
Member Sung?

06:14:22.580 --> 06:14:23.580
All right.

06:14:23.580 --> 06:14:26.580
So I will not be reporting on CTE because we've talked about CTE all morning.

06:14:27.580 --> 06:14:33.580
But I will report that I did attend the California Subject Matter Projects Lead Learn Conference

06:14:33.580 --> 06:14:38.580
on behalf of Board Member Strau, who was double booked at the time.

06:14:38.580 --> 06:14:46.580
It was a great conference as having been a fellow in the Area 3 writing project when I was a teacher.

06:14:46.580 --> 06:14:50.580
It was great to get back with the other teacher leaders.

06:14:50.580 --> 06:14:52.580
Excellent conference.

06:14:52.580 --> 06:15:03.580
And one of the workshops I noted and I attended was developed by or conducted by CCE,

06:15:03.580 --> 06:15:10.580
Ronnie Jones from CCE and Amber Valdez from West Ed that did a design thinking workshop

06:15:10.580 --> 06:15:13.580
on continuous improvement with teacher leaders.

06:15:13.580 --> 06:15:18.580
So looking at teacher leaders being a very important part of the school change process

06:15:18.580 --> 06:15:22.580
and taking them through that exercise, I think it was very similar to what was presented

06:15:22.580 --> 06:15:26.580
by the district on their special ed program.

06:15:26.580 --> 06:15:28.580
It was really fascinating to see.

06:15:28.580 --> 06:15:36.580
So really glad that CCE was involved with that conference and the teacher leaders in California as well.

06:15:36.580 --> 06:15:37.580
Thank you.

06:15:37.580 --> 06:15:39.580
Member Sandoval?

06:15:39.580 --> 06:15:43.580
Just a brief update on the California State Summer School for the Arts.

06:15:43.580 --> 06:15:50.580
The application closed last month, late February, and the board will be meeting early next week

06:15:50.580 --> 06:15:57.580
and looking forward to another fabulous session this summer.

06:15:57.580 --> 06:15:58.580
Thank you.

06:15:58.580 --> 06:15:59.580
Member Rucker?

06:15:59.580 --> 06:16:03.580
I have a rather lengthy report, so I'll beg your indulgence.

06:16:03.580 --> 06:16:07.580
It's only on three items, but there's a lot of information to share.

06:16:07.580 --> 06:16:13.580
I want to begin by talking about the California Emerging Technologies Fund.

06:16:13.580 --> 06:16:21.580
This is a nonprofit corporation established based on per requirements from the California Public Utilities

06:16:21.580 --> 06:16:28.580
Commission in approving the mergers of SBC, AT&T, and Verizon MCI.

06:16:28.580 --> 06:16:35.580
These merged companies made a commitment to contribute a total of $60 million over five years

06:16:35.580 --> 06:16:38.580
to advance broadband in the state.

06:16:38.580 --> 06:16:42.580
The high-speed communications that we generically refer to as broadband

06:16:42.580 --> 06:16:49.580
and defined by the FCC in terms of speed and kilobytes per second in at least one direction

06:16:49.580 --> 06:16:53.580
is important to communities all across the state.

06:16:53.580 --> 06:16:59.580
And what we know is that there exists a digital divide based on the community or the zip code you live in

06:16:59.580 --> 06:17:07.580
and the financial viability of families to be able to have access and pay for broadband on a regular basis.

06:17:07.580 --> 06:17:14.580
So the goal of the CETF is to close the digital divide and make this technology available

06:17:14.580 --> 06:17:21.580
to low-income families across the state and also to make connections to the schools

06:17:21.580 --> 06:17:27.580
where these communities are served to support these schools in their effort to close the achievement gap.

06:17:27.580 --> 06:17:34.580
Last month I attended one of their academies and this partnership has grown in scope and aspect

06:17:34.580 --> 06:17:36.580
over the time it's been created.

06:17:36.580 --> 06:17:44.580
These schools have met together, banded together with not only to create a community of practice among themselves,

06:17:44.580 --> 06:17:52.580
but have created a large collaboration with a number of community partners as well as policy partners

06:17:52.580 --> 06:17:58.580
both at the county and local level and municipal level in their governance and support by the boards

06:17:58.580 --> 06:18:03.580
as well as their elected officials.

06:18:03.580 --> 06:18:09.580
So the convening was in Long Beach at the Maya Hotel and in sitting there meeting with them

06:18:09.580 --> 06:18:14.580
one of the most important things they did was create an apparatus to hold themselves accountable

06:18:14.580 --> 06:18:19.580
for the impact and the rollout of these programs.

06:18:19.580 --> 06:18:25.580
Every single student in these participating LEAs receive a laptop computer that they get to keep

06:18:25.580 --> 06:18:31.580
and take home and use with their families and in doing that it provides an opportunity

06:18:31.580 --> 06:18:36.580
for the collaborating partners to provide technology integration training for teachers

06:18:36.580 --> 06:18:41.580
so that teachers understand the differences between simply substituting technology

06:18:41.580 --> 06:18:45.580
for regular instruction and full integration of technology

06:18:45.580 --> 06:18:49.580
and their goal is in continuous improvement to grow over time.

06:18:49.580 --> 06:18:55.580
Throughout the three days that I was there with them I had to keep reminding myself

06:18:55.580 --> 06:19:01.580
this is an instructional improvement program being sponsored by the PUC.

06:19:01.580 --> 06:19:06.580
So it's a program and a project worth monitoring and paying attention to

06:19:06.580 --> 06:19:11.580
because the schools have made a commitment to use this opportunity and the work that they are doing

06:19:11.580 --> 06:19:17.580
to both close the digital divide and to close the achievement gap with their students.

06:19:17.580 --> 06:19:22.580
The second thing I'm going to report on is the math program.

06:19:22.580 --> 06:19:27.580
As you know we are doing the work right now to update the math framework.

06:19:27.580 --> 06:19:33.580
So I'm going to begin by saying to all of us on this day is because math is a statewide priority

06:19:33.580 --> 06:19:39.580
because that's the subject area that is our lowest performing core subject on the statewide assessments

06:19:39.580 --> 06:19:49.580
it is a statewide priority but math as I say now every place I go needs to become your favorite school subject.

06:19:49.580 --> 06:19:56.580
So I'm going to begin by asking each of my board members not today but by the time we get to Teacher Appreciation Week

06:19:56.580 --> 06:20:00.580
I'd like you to think about who your math hero is.

06:20:00.580 --> 06:20:07.580
And so when we do that moment at the upcoming board meeting where we give our thanks to whoever our teacher heroes were

06:20:07.580 --> 06:20:15.580
I'd really like to ask you to think about who your math hero is and come to the board meeting to share that information.

06:20:15.580 --> 06:20:20.580
Anyway going forward the Mathematics Curriculum Frameworks and Evaluation Criteria Committee

06:20:20.580 --> 06:20:24.580
held its first meeting on February 26th and 27th.

06:20:24.580 --> 06:20:32.580
The committee is made up of teachers and practitioners who have a wide variety of experience in mathematics education.

06:20:32.580 --> 06:20:38.580
The 2021 Framework Revision is building on the work from the Mathematics Framework.

06:20:38.580 --> 06:20:47.580
Remember the 2013 Math Framework was the first framework this board adopted after the adoption of the Common Core.

06:20:47.580 --> 06:20:53.580
We have learned a lot about framework writing and supporting curriculum implementation from that time.

06:20:53.580 --> 06:21:00.580
And so the goal of this committee and the charge of this committee is to take what we've learned from subsequent frameworks

06:21:00.580 --> 06:21:05.580
and the work that has been done and improve on that conversation.

06:21:05.580 --> 06:21:11.580
It's a highly descriptive process that's been shared with the members in this charge

06:21:11.580 --> 06:21:19.580
and they are going at it full tilt to have the conversation about looking at and understanding what the framework should do

06:21:19.580 --> 06:21:21.580
and how it should port instruction.

06:21:21.580 --> 06:21:28.580
The standards themselves have not changed and so we're not rewriting the Common Core standards.

06:21:28.580 --> 06:21:37.580
What we are doing is taking a look at how the context of how we're implementing mathematics instruction has changed.

06:21:37.580 --> 06:21:41.580
Since the Math Framework was implemented we have a new funding formula.

06:21:41.580 --> 06:21:47.580
We've matured and developed the dashboard and we've changed the way accountability works

06:21:47.580 --> 06:21:51.580
and we have fully matured and developed our CASP system.

06:21:51.580 --> 06:21:57.580
So the goal now is to produce a framework that will be just as strong as the framework we just recently adopted

06:21:57.580 --> 06:22:04.580
in science and in health so that that framework provides guidance to teachers that is understandable

06:22:04.580 --> 06:22:13.580
and focuses on what the data is telling us from the math assessment not only that teachers need but that students need to understand.

06:22:13.580 --> 06:22:21.580
The goal, the plan that is laid out for the development of the framework is for a series of five additional two-day meetings.

06:22:21.580 --> 06:22:27.580
The next meeting of the framework will be March 25th and 26th here at the CDE.

06:22:27.580 --> 06:22:35.580
And you know whenever I talk about the Math Framework I always always try to remember to remind you that we also have a separate initiative

06:22:35.580 --> 06:22:41.580
that's going on that's being sponsored by State Board of Education staff, Carolyn Fister.

06:22:41.580 --> 06:22:47.580
So I'm going to ask Carolyn to help me with my last item that I want to report on.

06:22:47.580 --> 06:22:54.580
I have previously given you updates about the work that's being done through the California Statewide Early Math Initiative.

06:22:54.580 --> 06:23:02.580
The Math Initiative is led by the Fresno County Office of Education as part of the state's system of support.

06:23:02.580 --> 06:23:10.580
It's a multifaceted, multi-fat, multi-agency effort that focuses on improving children's mathematical outcomes

06:23:10.580 --> 06:23:16.580
through professional learning, coaching, family engagement, resources, research and communications.

06:23:16.580 --> 06:23:23.580
Many of these resources are already available on the Early Math Project website and the AIMS website.

06:23:23.580 --> 06:23:30.580
And there's a lot of new resources that are under development and will be added to the website in the coming months.

06:23:30.580 --> 06:23:36.580
Today I'm very excited to show you a sample of one of those new resources.

06:23:36.580 --> 06:23:43.580
The initiative has been working with film director Les Mayfield to create 30 short videos

06:23:43.580 --> 06:23:49.580
that will be a foundational piece of an early math application and communication campaign.

06:23:49.580 --> 06:23:53.580
So I'd like to share a sneak peek with you of one of those videos.

06:24:07.580 --> 06:24:11.580
Okay Jake, you ready for another adventure?

06:24:11.580 --> 06:24:12.580
Ready!

06:24:12.580 --> 06:24:17.580
Alright, hold on to your car seat. It's time for a shape safari!

06:24:17.580 --> 06:24:21.580
We are now heading deep into the wilds of shape country.

06:24:21.580 --> 06:24:24.580
Be on the lookout for the elusive triangle.

06:24:24.580 --> 06:24:27.580
Look, there's one! Triangle!

06:24:27.580 --> 06:24:32.580
Alright, good job bud. Now, let's see if we can find a square.

06:24:32.580 --> 06:24:35.580
They're not easy to spot and they often hide in the trees.

06:24:35.580 --> 06:24:36.580
Square!

06:24:36.580 --> 06:24:41.580
Alright, good job bud. Can you find a circle?

06:24:41.580 --> 06:24:43.580
There's a circle?

06:24:43.580 --> 06:24:44.580
Where?

06:24:44.580 --> 06:24:46.580
Right there!

06:24:46.580 --> 06:24:48.580
It was right under my nose!

06:24:48.580 --> 06:24:51.580
Alright, now I've saved the hardest question for last. You ready?

06:24:51.580 --> 06:24:52.580
Yes!

06:24:52.580 --> 06:24:54.580
What do you want for dinner?

06:24:54.580 --> 06:24:55.580
A circle!

06:24:55.580 --> 06:24:58.580
Hey Jake, a circle is not a food buddy.

06:24:58.580 --> 06:25:00.580
But it's a shape!

06:25:00.580 --> 06:25:03.580
Oh, alright! Good job bud!

06:25:03.580 --> 06:25:07.580
And the winner of today's shape safari is Jake!

06:25:07.580 --> 06:25:09.580
Woo!

06:25:09.580 --> 06:25:13.580
For answering all the questions correct today, you have won a round pizza.

06:25:13.580 --> 06:25:17.580
Yes, a pizza made of round pepperonis. Yes!

06:25:17.580 --> 06:25:18.580
Thanks dad!

06:25:18.580 --> 06:25:22.580
Hey Jake, I'm hungry. What do you think about a couple slices of circle?

06:25:22.580 --> 06:25:24.580
Sounds good!

06:25:24.580 --> 06:25:27.580
And that concludes my report. Thank you Member Rucker.

06:25:27.580 --> 06:25:32.580
Well Brenna, I'm like this is really hard but you've got to follow her.

06:25:32.580 --> 06:25:44.580
Alright, so I know it's been talked about a lot at the meeting and I really do thank the CDE for diligently working with the coronavirus and making sure that our students are safe.

06:25:44.580 --> 06:25:50.580
It's good to hear that. I think that's kind of, you know, lost from the students perspective but it's good to know that there's that much effort being put into it.

06:25:50.580 --> 06:26:00.580
I do believe that with the communication there's, I think districts are definitely going to have a good sense of what to do and the actions to take.

06:26:00.580 --> 06:26:05.580
However, I also think it's important that they are being told how to communicate.

06:26:05.580 --> 06:26:10.580
I think districts are definitely going to have a good sense of what to do and the actions to take.

06:26:10.580 --> 06:26:16.580
However, I also think it's important that they are being told how to talk to students themselves.

06:26:16.580 --> 06:26:21.580
I think that's an important piece too. I know a lot of students, you know, are very confused.

06:26:21.580 --> 06:26:27.580
We haven't really been through something like this before and that adds to panic and when there's panic I know the situation just gets worse.

06:26:27.580 --> 06:26:30.580
So that's one thing that I just thought I'd mention to keep in mind.

06:26:31.580 --> 06:26:40.580
And then the other thing was just I would like to look into working with staff to possibly redesign the actual position that I am in right now.

06:26:40.580 --> 06:26:50.580
So looking forward and trying to redesign that. So maybe students following me have a more sustainable and adequate platform to really make change moving forward.

06:26:50.580 --> 06:26:52.580
Thank you.

06:26:52.580 --> 06:26:57.580
Okay, thanks. Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

06:26:57.580 --> 06:27:07.580
Well, this morning I was appointed as the chair of the Latinx Advisory Council, a committee that was created.

06:27:07.580 --> 06:27:14.580
And so moving forward, I look forward to reporting from the other side on the Latinx Advisory Council.

06:27:14.580 --> 06:27:20.580
And I just want to say, Member Rucker, you put me in a panic when you said I'm going to have homework for you board members.

06:27:20.580 --> 06:27:25.580
I thought it was to solve a math problem, but I was like, oh no, don't do that to us.

06:27:25.580 --> 06:27:32.580
Yeah, I really don't have any other than my new, I'm looking at everyone, I'm putting it in document here.

06:27:32.580 --> 06:27:35.580
Yes, other than my new committee.

06:27:35.580 --> 06:27:40.580
Thank you. Member Navo.

06:27:40.580 --> 06:27:44.580
That was funny. I really appreciate math being lifted up.

06:27:44.580 --> 06:27:51.580
I had my favorite teacher said, Navo, you're the best D student I've ever had.

06:27:51.580 --> 06:27:56.580
It was in math.

06:27:56.580 --> 06:27:59.580
So, and he said, you could be the best A student I ever had.

06:27:59.580 --> 06:28:04.580
And that was when I actually put some effort into my schooling.

06:28:04.580 --> 06:28:09.580
And so, yeah, it just reminded me a lot of unique challenges. Thank you for bringing that up.

06:28:09.580 --> 06:28:12.580
So the system of support has a lot going on with it.

06:28:12.580 --> 06:28:19.580
I think there's a lot of great collaboration between CDE, CCEE and county offices and geo leads and CELPA leads.

06:28:19.580 --> 06:28:24.580
I'm going to be brief simply because, you know, barely breathe here.

06:28:24.580 --> 06:28:27.580
There's not a big audience, to be honest.

06:28:27.580 --> 06:28:30.580
But there are two things that I think should be on our radars.

06:28:30.580 --> 06:28:39.580
One, the system of support in the four districts in the state that are really moving towards this tier three type of intervention.

06:28:39.580 --> 06:28:49.580
They're in a two point point five evaluation with CCEE using the systemic instructional review that really goes in.

06:28:49.580 --> 06:28:55.580
It's a really delicate process, but it's really going into these districts that are struggling to get the outcomes that they want.

06:28:55.580 --> 06:29:07.580
Really is trying to separate skill versus will and really trying to lift up what are the options for the system of support with regards to how best to meet the needs of the educators in those systems that are working so hard.

06:29:07.580 --> 06:29:14.580
And so I think this will be coming to us a little bit more clearly with regards to.

06:29:14.580 --> 06:29:23.580
So what do we do as if if these districts continue to struggle to produce the outcomes that they want?

06:29:23.580 --> 06:29:29.580
And the system of the support has exhausted its system of support, so to speak.

06:29:29.580 --> 06:29:31.580
What happens? What can we do next?

06:29:31.580 --> 06:29:36.580
I think this is a real issue for a lot of people out there watching the system of support.

06:29:36.580 --> 06:29:40.580
So what's going to happen with districts keep moving, keep moving, keep moving, and nothing keeps getting better.

06:29:40.580 --> 06:29:44.580
I think we saw some of those issues come up today.

06:29:44.580 --> 06:29:52.580
The other one is the CDE and CCEE produced the basic levers, basic components tool.

06:29:52.580 --> 06:30:05.580
So for those of you that are unfamiliar with that, that's a six component assessment of the foundational infrastructure of a district around its readiness to actually produce positive outcomes for students with disabilities.

06:30:05.580 --> 06:30:15.580
So if a system wants to do kind of an assessment of its foundational readiness around its ability to move outcomes for students with disabilities,

06:30:15.580 --> 06:30:23.580
this is the first tool that I'm aware of that really gives a district an opportunity to just go through that very quickly and highlight some areas that are they struggle with.

06:30:23.580 --> 06:30:27.580
So I think that just that just hit the newsletter.

06:30:27.580 --> 06:30:32.580
So I think as districts see that they will be very interested in that.

06:30:32.580 --> 06:30:36.580
The only other thing I'm going to I'm going to say about the system of support.

06:30:37.580 --> 06:30:53.580
I have it here is, I think that I want to commend you as board members for all of the hard work that you've been a part of over the last, especially 10 years, for those of you that have been on that long and I want to thank

06:30:53.580 --> 06:31:00.580
board member Felicia, these are Lacon and Nikki for all that you do.

06:31:00.580 --> 06:31:12.580
But I think if we step back and you look at what you've actually accomplished, the system of support is obviously at a place where people are wondering if it's going to work.

06:31:12.580 --> 06:31:19.580
But what we forget is how much we have asked the locals to do.

06:31:19.580 --> 06:31:34.580
And if you were to come into this system in 2010 to now, and you're a teacher that just entered the system, you have experienced in 2010 common core standards of VLA and math.

06:31:34.580 --> 06:31:48.580
2012 ELD standards in the seal of by literacy 2013 14 the LCFF and LCAP implementation, which all of this requires educating the professionals in the field about what's happening.

06:31:48.580 --> 06:32:02.580
In 2014, ELA and ELD framework which was 1400 pages in 2015, the ESA in 2016 global 2030 initiative prop 58 which was a new dual language program.

06:32:02.580 --> 06:32:07.580
2017 the California EL roadmap and the new outback assessment.

06:32:07.580 --> 06:32:22.580
2018 you had 1718 had the belief modules around the else 2018 you have the US newcomer toolkit around the else in 2019 you had the California practitioners guide to supporting English learners with disabilities.

06:32:22.580 --> 06:32:27.580
In 2019 you had the English learner toolkit of strategies that successive put out.

06:32:27.580 --> 06:32:31.580
And in 2020 you have the new online LPAC and field testing.

06:32:31.580 --> 06:32:34.580
And in 2020 21 you have the alternative LPAC.

06:32:34.580 --> 06:32:42.580
That's not counting MTSS, UDL, math, and science.

06:32:42.580 --> 06:32:46.580
And we ask ourselves, well, hurry up.

06:32:46.580 --> 06:32:54.580
I think if we don't take time to reflect the educators in the system, I think of the teachers that are were in our system.

06:32:54.580 --> 06:33:00.580
We were a district that was on the move and we couldn't get to EL training.

06:33:00.580 --> 06:33:06.580
Because we had we those are teachers were trying to figure out UDL.

06:33:06.580 --> 06:33:11.580
So I think it's just I want to commend you for all that you're doing, but I think it's a great time to just kind of.

06:33:11.580 --> 06:33:14.580
Except that the system of support is going to take some time.

06:33:14.580 --> 06:33:16.580
So thank you.

06:33:16.580 --> 06:33:19.580
Member Burke.

06:33:19.580 --> 06:33:20.580
Thank you, Matt.

06:33:20.580 --> 06:33:21.580
That's apropos of that.

06:33:21.580 --> 06:33:31.580
I think it's important for us to repeat our mantra that from our former president, Mike Kirst, patience, persistence, humility.

06:33:31.580 --> 06:33:34.580
I always live by those words and I think it's very important.

06:33:34.580 --> 06:33:39.580
I appreciate you going through that inventory because I think we kind of lose sight of that.

06:33:39.580 --> 06:33:48.580
And I'll just take a point of privilege, personal privilege and say years ago, I worked at the state level for a former governor not to be named.

06:33:48.580 --> 06:33:57.580
And went to work for a school district because I really wanted to work in a school district and fresh off of four major initiatives that we passed at the state level.

06:33:57.580 --> 06:34:02.580
Expecting to see on the first day that I stepped foot in that district, everything was underway.

06:34:02.580 --> 06:34:05.580
And they looked at me like I'd lost my mind.

06:34:05.580 --> 06:34:13.580
And so it was a great lesson for me to think about what we think we're doing at the state and we're doing all these whiz bang things and it's going to happen immediately.

06:34:13.580 --> 06:34:22.580
And at least from my experience, it takes a minimum of two years for the information to even permeate at the level.

06:34:22.580 --> 06:34:25.580
So that's why I go back to and we should repeat after ourselves.

06:34:25.580 --> 06:34:30.580
Patience, persistence, humility.

06:34:30.580 --> 06:34:33.580
Yeah.

06:34:34.580 --> 06:34:39.580
So briefly, you already heard about my one assignment that I share with Eileen accountability.

06:34:39.580 --> 06:34:46.580
We took that up this morning and again, kudos to the department and the board staff for all the work they do around that tomorrow morning.

06:34:46.580 --> 06:34:49.580
You'll hear about my second assignment, which is charter schools.

06:34:49.580 --> 06:34:53.580
Yeah, we have two appeals that you'll hear a lot about tomorrow.

06:34:53.580 --> 06:34:56.580
So that's the end of my report.

06:34:56.580 --> 06:35:02.580
So I won't be I think I'm going to match you for information, but I'll try to go a little faster so we can get out.

06:35:02.580 --> 06:35:03.580
I know it's a lot of stuff.

06:35:03.580 --> 06:35:04.580
Yours is so powerful.

06:35:04.580 --> 06:35:10.580
But anyway, Patricia and I both share IQC as an overall liaison to it.

06:35:10.580 --> 06:35:16.580
And we were very fortunate to orient and train all the new IQC members in January right after our meeting.

06:35:16.580 --> 06:35:23.580
And so we broke they had an organizational meeting where they are all broken up into new subject matter project and assignments.

06:35:23.580 --> 06:35:28.580
And so we really have a good committed and the training was just solid.

06:35:28.580 --> 06:35:34.580
The CDE has done an amazing job in orienting and training them on what their roles and what the process is.

06:35:34.580 --> 06:35:39.580
There will be there's edits to the visual performing arts and the world language framework.

06:35:39.580 --> 06:35:40.580
They're out for the second 30 day comment.

06:35:40.580 --> 06:35:42.580
They'll come back to IQC.

06:35:42.580 --> 06:35:45.580
We will see them in July, just so you know.

06:35:45.580 --> 06:35:48.580
And there's ongoing work on ethnic studies.

06:35:48.580 --> 06:35:50.580
I think we'll hear a little more about that.

06:35:50.580 --> 06:35:52.580
The other thing is we have a math community of practice.

06:35:52.580 --> 06:35:57.580
So you might remember that we have in several subject areas where you have a collaboration,

06:35:57.580 --> 06:36:01.580
small group of 30 people from around the state that are leaders in say math and in science.

06:36:01.580 --> 06:36:08.580
And then they come together three times a year with about 100 members regionally from around the state to work on math or on science.

06:36:08.580 --> 06:36:13.580
And actually the meeting at the end of April supposed to be math and science coming together for one day.

06:36:13.580 --> 06:36:15.580
So 200 people and then breaking back up.

06:36:15.580 --> 06:36:21.580
So that's here and I'll let you know when it's going to be in Sacramento, although we'll see if it's virtual at this point.

06:36:21.580 --> 06:36:29.580
So the math community practice met in January 22nd, 23rd, and they actually had a speaker called Rehumanizing Mathematics,

06:36:29.580 --> 06:36:35.580
which is really, I think, important to think about that how we think about our work matters.

06:36:35.580 --> 06:36:39.580
And so it was a great kind of opening keynote to the group.

06:36:40.580 --> 06:36:45.580
WestEd shared some really valuable tools and practices on standards implementation.

06:36:45.580 --> 06:36:53.580
I think what we're seeing and that all of us have realized is how long it takes from standards to framework to materials alignment to finally implementation.

06:36:53.580 --> 06:36:55.580
So I think WestEd's research has been helpful.

06:36:55.580 --> 06:36:59.580
And so they were an important player there.

06:36:59.580 --> 06:37:04.580
We do have a concurrence commission that meets twice a year on the subject matter projects.

06:37:04.580 --> 06:37:09.580
And you might know that over the years, the budget has been dwindled to almost nothing.

06:37:09.580 --> 06:37:13.580
And so there is some money in the governor's budget to enhance their work.

06:37:13.580 --> 06:37:16.580
Again, it's not resolved yet.

06:37:16.580 --> 06:37:26.580
But what they had a big conversation at the concurrence commission in January about how the subject matter projects need to be sure they're aligned to the priorities of the governor's vision.

06:37:26.580 --> 06:37:34.580
And so each project lead actually gave support and what the science project's doing, what the history project's doing.

06:37:34.580 --> 06:37:42.580
And then a lot of discussion also about computer science and a desire to have an area of focus in computer science, which is a priority as well.

06:37:42.580 --> 06:37:44.580
So you'll hear more about that.

06:37:44.580 --> 06:37:51.580
There were a lot of presentations and they had their annual lead learn conference, which Ting reported on.

06:37:51.580 --> 06:37:55.580
And that's building capacity of teacher leaders to do really important work.

06:37:55.580 --> 06:37:58.580
They'll be meeting at Oakland in June.

06:37:58.580 --> 06:38:01.580
The credentialing commission, I just want to do a little bit on special ed.

06:38:01.580 --> 06:38:05.580
So the credentialing commission does a lot of teacher performance assessments.

06:38:05.580 --> 06:38:18.580
And so there's been a change, particularly around special ed teachers, that all teachers have a core level of instruction, that all teachers in their teacher preparation, what Mary Vixie Sandy calls it, a common trunk in the tree.

06:38:18.580 --> 06:38:21.580
So everybody gets the training to deal with all students.

06:38:21.580 --> 06:38:23.580
And then there's branches and specialization.

06:38:23.580 --> 06:38:26.580
And so that's changed in some of the teacher performance assessments.

06:38:26.580 --> 06:38:30.580
But remember, those of us that Matt was talking about, who've been in the system a while, weren't trained that way.

06:38:30.580 --> 06:38:38.580
And so really, the whole system is trying to rethink how teachers are trained in capacity and strategies to deal with students with special needs.

06:38:38.580 --> 06:38:41.580
The science community of practice met in February.

06:38:41.580 --> 06:38:45.580
And so you heard some members talk to us about science.

06:38:45.580 --> 06:38:51.580
There's a very strong science community out there trying to really work on implementation of NGSS.

06:38:51.580 --> 06:38:54.580
They've been wonderful and very, very helpful.

06:38:54.580 --> 06:38:59.580
They have regional teams to deal with sustainable practices, and they are right there helping us.

06:38:59.580 --> 06:39:03.580
It's just we have lots of communities of practice and lots of leaders in every area.

06:39:03.580 --> 06:39:06.580
But science is very vibrant and very, very committed.

06:39:06.580 --> 06:39:15.580
So we were supposed to have a meeting coming up with the science and math leads, but it's going virtual, obviously, because things have changed.

06:39:15.580 --> 06:39:23.580
And then L.A. County Office of Ed, like other county offices, kicked off their system of support and I opened it on the differentiated assistance.

06:39:23.580 --> 06:39:29.580
And they talked a lot. That's a giant county. That county has 25 percent of the kids in the state of California.

06:39:29.580 --> 06:39:34.580
They had to completely reorganize to try to break down their silos to do differentiated assistance.

06:39:34.580 --> 06:39:42.580
And to their credit, the energy and the relationships and the resources that they offered were incredibly positive.

06:39:42.580 --> 06:39:51.580
And when I talked to districts who were targeted for differentiated assistance, they felt like the county was going in there as a partner in a different way than it might have been in the past.

06:39:51.580 --> 06:39:57.580
And they were hopeful. The dilemma was these were districts just some just identified.

06:39:57.580 --> 06:40:02.580
They met in February. Testing is going to be in May. Cycle is going to end. And then we start again.

06:40:02.580 --> 06:40:08.580
But anyway, they were there and it's a big lot of districts there and working really hard.

06:40:08.580 --> 06:40:12.580
So a credit to the county office and their leaders for really trying to reach out.

06:40:12.580 --> 06:40:24.580
And then you might remember that in December, the CSU UC State Board CDE came together around climate summit and Kim Patia Bronson went.

06:40:24.580 --> 06:40:34.580
And so there was a follow up meeting in March last week talking about what do we do next about climate creating climate warriors and all of our students and how do we help.

06:40:34.580 --> 06:40:43.580
So those of you who have been around in the framework process know that in our world, in our history framework and in our science framework, the environmental principles and concepts are in it.

06:40:43.580 --> 06:40:46.580
But those we work so hard on those frameworks.

06:40:46.580 --> 06:40:52.580
But how long it takes to get those frameworks out to teachers and districts we know is longer than we hope.

06:40:52.580 --> 06:40:55.580
And they really want it integrated in teacher prep.

06:40:55.580 --> 06:41:01.580
We want it integrated in classroom instruction and we want kids the next generation to be strong climate warriors.

06:41:01.580 --> 06:41:03.580
And so that was a discussion.

06:41:03.580 --> 06:41:10.580
It all came around to models of curriculum, lessons, teachers being confident enough to be able to work on climate literacy.

06:41:10.580 --> 06:41:16.580
But definitely a desire of UC CSU CDE State Board to do that.

06:41:16.580 --> 06:41:20.580
How that actually trickles down as we know is easier said than done.

06:41:20.580 --> 06:41:24.580
But that just happened and I'm sure we're going to hear a little bit more about that.

06:41:24.580 --> 06:41:28.580
So anyway, that ends my report.

06:41:29.580 --> 06:41:39.580
Anyway, so with that, if there's any other comments or reports that people forgot to maybe say something, this meeting will be continued tomorrow.

06:41:39.580 --> 06:41:43.580
Do we have public comments today?

06:41:43.580 --> 06:41:45.580
Because the public comments are tomorrow.

06:41:45.580 --> 06:41:49.580
General public comments are tomorrow.

06:41:50.580 --> 06:41:52.580
So tomorrow we're going to start at 830.

06:41:52.580 --> 06:41:58.580
The meeting's being continued and we're going to meet in closed session to discuss or take action on the case.

06:41:58.580 --> 06:42:02.580
Emma C plus versus the state.

06:42:02.580 --> 06:42:05.580
OK, so this ends this session.

06:42:05.580 --> 06:42:08.580
The meeting is continued till tomorrow.

06:42:08.580 --> 06:42:10.580
Do I have to hammer this right?

06:42:10.580 --> 06:42:12.580
OK, thank you very much.

06:42:19.580 --> 06:42:21.580
Thank you.
