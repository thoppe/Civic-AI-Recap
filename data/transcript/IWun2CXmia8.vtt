WEBVTT

00:09.191 --> 00:10.311
Okay, I guess we're ready.

00:10.331 --> 00:20.994
The State Board will come to order with the salute to the flag.

00:23.215 --> 00:33.097
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,

00:41.129 --> 00:44.558
So we'll begin today with the report of the superintendent.

00:45.780 --> 00:47.284
Thank you, President Kuerz and board members.

00:47.304 --> 00:47.825
Happy summer.

00:49.187 --> 00:49.687
schools out.

00:50.188 --> 00:50.528
We're in.

00:51.268 --> 00:55.711
We've got a great meeting in front of us today so welcome everyone who's joined us as well.

00:56.411 --> 01:01.014
I want to give an update on some things that have occurred since our last board meeting and report to you.

01:02.314 --> 01:04.816
We launched the new app, the California Schools app.

01:05.216 --> 01:13.681
With one click you can find any school anywhere and details about just about any subject you're curious about, information about the school's history, dashboard data,

01:14.601 --> 01:19.365
It's another important step in our ongoing efforts to expand access and transparency.

01:19.845 --> 01:25.509
I wanted to introduce to you the individual who developed the app with the team in our technology division.

01:25.990 --> 01:26.830
Dylan Ryan is here.

01:27.531 --> 01:27.891
Thank you.

01:32.254 --> 01:33.675
And it's so simple, you won't need any help.

01:33.715 --> 01:35.617
But if you did need his help, his home number is... No.

01:39.128 --> 01:42.511
So that's a really important milestone.

01:42.571 --> 01:47.956
And I also want to introduce you, reintroduce to some of you who knew her when she worked here previously.

01:48.036 --> 01:53.040
Sarah Neville Morgan is our new Director of Early Education and Support Division.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.921
She most recently, there she is.

01:56.843 --> 01:59.225
Congratulations and you'll be seeing a lot more of her.

02:00.086 --> 02:07.933
She served recently as a Deputy Director of Program Management for First 5 California and worked previously at CDE as a consultant from 2011 to 2013.

02:11.280 --> 02:27.078
And speaking of early education, I recently thanked the governor in signing the budget this year that increases funding for early education and child care and after school programs and teacher recruitment and training and several other really key investments in the budget.

02:27.799 --> 02:41.887
The budget continues the strong growth that I call the California way where our legislature, our governor, this board, my office, my team, we're working together in a very positive way to have positive change in education.

02:42.427 --> 02:48.550
Some highlights in the budget include the long-awaited increase, $50 million for after-school education and safety programs.

02:49.210 --> 02:50.711
We currently serve 500,000 students in almost 4,500 sites.

02:54.333 --> 03:04.196
Also very pleased about $2.5 million that we specifically worked with the legislature on, Shirley Weber being one of the key proponents of this to help us.

03:05.657 --> 03:10.038
$2.5 million for what I call equity team, it's called the equity performance improvement team.

03:10.418 --> 03:16.700
Their grants at CDE will be putting forward to really focus on closing achievement gap.

03:17.360 --> 03:25.862
providing extra focused assistance in that way and we're looking at a structure with five fellows and regional hubs of information and support.

03:27.043 --> 03:34.625
The budget further expanded teacher recruitment and training, additional funding including five million for professional development for bilingual teachers.

03:35.822 --> 03:45.706
And as you know, the demand in all of our schools across the state is growing rapidly for bilingual education, driven in part by the terrific success of Prop 58.

03:48.007 --> 03:48.887
Aren't we happy about that?

03:48.907 --> 03:53.709
That took down some barriers that shouldn't have been there, but they were for a couple of decades, and we got rid of them.

03:54.429 --> 04:00.652
73% of Californians voted for Prop 58, and now we need to really gear up our bilingual education.

04:01.572 --> 04:09.215
Speaking of bilingual education, a highlight of my last few months was traveling to Mexico City.

04:09.635 --> 04:18.459
We had several highly productive meetings and a summit with top education officials in Mexico, including Secretary of Education Aurelio Nuno.

04:19.319 --> 04:26.562
We talked about expanding CDE's exchange teacher program, which currently has 105 full-time contracts for classroom teachers.

04:27.577 --> 04:29.817
from Mexico and other nations who come to California.

04:30.418 --> 04:40.980
We also look forward to working with the Secretary of Education in Mexico for assisting us in helping more California teachers get to Mexico to build their language skills and enter programs to do that.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.620
Many thanks to the CDE staff who helped make this trip possible.

04:45.080 --> 04:48.501
Jasmin Ortega, Marcela Enriquez, and Veronica Aguila.

04:48.861 --> 04:53.122
I don't know if Veronica is here or any of her team, but I wanted to publicly thank them for their

04:53.622 --> 04:56.403
Bridge building, where we say more bridges.

04:56.423 --> 04:58.824
How do we say it?

05:00.084 --> 05:02.865
Queremos construir puentes, no muros.

05:03.425 --> 05:06.726
We would like to build bridges rather than walls.

05:10.845 --> 05:15.991
Summer Institute, Labor Management Institute, had another very successful program.

05:16.551 --> 05:20.115
As always, we thank Shelly Mazur and the CDE Foundation for the work that's going on there.

05:20.175 --> 05:23.198
Great team building between labor and management across the state.

05:23.258 --> 05:28.224
Over 100 LEAs have now been part of the training and part of the good experience of this.

05:30.168 --> 05:33.250
Back to school beyond safe havens is the next topic.

05:33.750 --> 05:44.175
I just wanted to report our safe haven effort has reached now to 113 school districts in the state, representing and covering, providing more protection help to 2.7 million students.

05:46.156 --> 05:52.478
We have parents, speakers, and workshops coming to a fall get-together to focus on the Safe Haven program.

05:53.338 --> 06:03.261
We know that there's still a lot of anxiety out there, a lot of confusion out there about the President's deportation policies, and we want to help our students and families through that rough time.

06:04.782 --> 06:12.764
Glenn Price, I'm just going to ask if he could give a minute to talk about the RE-ORG and the Fall Festival that we plan coming up in September.

06:18.325 --> 06:22.069
Well, thank you, Superintendent Torlakson, President Kirsten, Board of Education.

06:23.390 --> 06:33.099
Building on our state's work with implementation of local control funding formula, we're doing some realignment here at the Department of Education where we're restructuring our branches.

06:33.760 --> 06:38.004
And if you check out the CDA web page, there's a new org chart there.

06:38.524 --> 06:45.990
And we've realigned to three branches from four that we've been working with over the past, actually, quite a number of years.

06:46.391 --> 06:55.598
And those three are performance planning and technology, which will be led by Kerrick Ashley, teaching and learning, which will be led by Tom Adams.

06:56.099 --> 07:02.524
And Nick Schweitzer is not in the room right now, but he's well known to many of you, who will be heading our system support work.

07:02.924 --> 07:04.826
So three branches that we're aligning to

07:05.373 --> 07:13.100
performance planning and technology, teaching and learning, and system support, and we expect they'll be creating some great teams within those branches.

07:13.681 --> 07:29.255
As the superintendent alluded to at the same time, we're continuing our work to really increase teamwork and collaboration within the department by building upon and extending the work of some existing teams and creating a couple new ones which we've dubbed citywide action teams.

07:29.295 --> 07:31.477
So these are teams that draw upon the resources

07:32.077 --> 07:34.739
of all of our branches to work on priority issues.

07:34.859 --> 07:38.481
And there's four citywide action teams being launched.

07:38.582 --> 07:40.042
The first is system of support.

07:40.423 --> 07:45.066
So this will draw upon resources to support the development of the statewide system of support.

07:45.666 --> 07:55.373
The second is integrated planning, which will continue the work of our preexisting LCAP support team, supporting work with LCAP development, implementation, and evaluation.

07:55.393 --> 08:01.717
And of course, we hope will be the subsequent implementation of LEA planning through an LCAP addenda.

08:02.557 --> 08:14.102
The third would be our one system integration team which is building on the work of the one system special education task force and looking at how we can create one system of education in the state of California.

08:14.602 --> 08:27.607
And the fourth as alluded to by the superintendent is team advancement which is headed up by Brianna Mullen and that will be an inward facing team where we're looking at building collaboration and forms of support for our team here at CDE.

08:28.687 --> 08:33.351
And a really exciting event that they have planned coming up, we've been doing a series of summits.

08:34.552 --> 08:37.314
The last one was our spring refresh on April 20th.

08:37.634 --> 08:42.698
And as we move into the fall, we're gonna be hosting here in the building, Back to School Festival.

08:43.039 --> 08:55.969
We're gonna be transforming the lobby area coming into this room and creating a festival-like atmosphere here in the building where we'll be having interactive learning exhibits, highlighting the new realignment of the department.

08:56.289 --> 09:10.992
some exciting activities and work going on so check out your calendars for that event coming up and the Back to School Festival will also feature as one of its flagship events the Beyond Safe Havens Forum that Superintendent Torlakson just described.

09:12.250 --> 09:15.832
Thank you, Chief Deputy Glenn, and we're ready to go.

09:15.852 --> 09:22.277
I predict that one of the top highlights of the summer will be this meeting today and our meeting tomorrow.

09:22.297 --> 09:26.280
Of course, we're very focused on the ESSA plan and the public input to that plan.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.682
Much has gone on in terms of 13 community workshops.

09:30.082 --> 09:33.424
Hundreds of citizens contacted and provided input to the ESSA plan.

09:33.444 --> 09:39.509
I want to thank Barbara Murchison and Joy Kessel for their tireless efforts and terrific work on getting us to this point today.

09:39.569 --> 09:40.970
And now let's have a great meeting.

09:41.890 --> 09:42.090
Thanks.

09:42.450 --> 09:43.391
Thank you for that.

09:43.411 --> 09:46.271
OK, I have several announcements.

09:46.632 --> 09:54.114
The first one is I'd like to thank our student member, Olivia Sisson, for her service during the past year.

09:54.134 --> 09:56.595
And this is her last meeting.

09:56.695 --> 09:59.615
Unfortunately, just as we get to know these people, they go away.

10:01.016 --> 10:06.618
And it's been a pleasure for us to have your service with us.

10:06.738 --> 10:10.959
And your bringing of the student perspective is much appreciated.

10:12.118 --> 10:30.395
We all knew and announced before that she had been early admissions admit to Harvard University in the fall where she intends to major within biology and minor in Middle Eastern studies, but we just found out that she is the valedictorian of C.K.

10:30.475 --> 10:33.818
McClatchy High School in Sacramento, a very large school.

10:33.839 --> 10:34.879
So,

10:38.337 --> 10:41.659
I would like to now present you with this certificate of service.

10:55.428 --> 11:01.172
OK, I'm also delighted to announce that the State Board of Education office has hired Pam Castleman.

11:01.412 --> 11:02.113
Please stand up.

11:03.717 --> 11:04.418
There you are.

11:04.658 --> 11:05.639
Oh, OK.

11:06.480 --> 11:15.309
As an education program consultant, her background is really extensive in curriculum and instruction, the area that she will focus upon.

11:16.431 --> 11:20.915
She started her career as a history, social science high school teacher in Texas.

11:21.716 --> 11:36.117
She was an assistant principal of high schools in the Semi Valley, district coordinator for instructional materials adoption, state assessments, and career and adult vocation education programs.

11:37.245 --> 11:45.475
Most recently, she was Director of Continuing Education at the Ventura County Office of Education, working on workforce education.

11:46.477 --> 11:55.067
At the State Board of Education, she will be involved in the computer science model standards work.

11:55.868 --> 12:05.276
and other future standards adoption work, such as visual and performing arts, world languages, and model standards for ethnic studies.

12:05.976 --> 12:14.463
And she will also assist with our new Joint Advisory Committee on Workforce Pathways, which will be meeting this Friday of this week.

12:15.264 --> 12:21.749
So welcome to us, and we really look forward to your extensive experience in helping us.

12:23.038 --> 12:25.372
So my other, yeah, we'll give her a hand.

12:30.228 --> 12:37.755
So, other announcements I have are the internal board issues in terms of how we'll run the meeting.

12:37.795 --> 12:41.379
We have Spanish interpreter services available all day today.

12:42.019 --> 12:44.061
We have two public hearings tomorrow.

12:45.282 --> 12:53.350
The proposed formation of a new unified school district from the Huron portion of the Coalinga-Huron Unified School District.

12:53.750 --> 13:00.896
in Fresno, and then a petition for the establishment of a charter school called Sweetwater Secondary School.

13:02.418 --> 13:06.321
There are agenda for the two following items.

13:06.361 --> 13:08.503
These are addendum to our agenda.

13:08.563 --> 13:09.403
These are additions.

13:10.004 --> 13:11.405
Item 3, attachment 4,

13:12.846 --> 13:16.789
Phase 4, public comment report for the draft ESSA state plan.

13:17.169 --> 13:25.214
This outlines all of the outreach and public engagement work that the CDE and the State Board of Education have been doing.

13:25.834 --> 13:37.401
And attachment 6, item 6, I should say, attachment 4, economic and fiscal impact statement for the California Education for a Global Initiative proposed regulations.

13:37.441 --> 13:38.261
That's proposition 58.

13:40.083 --> 13:43.949
We have regular consent items of items 7 to 17.

13:46.693 --> 13:47.975
We'll be taking those up.

13:48.175 --> 13:53.544
We also have proposed waiver consent items W01 through W19.

13:56.084 --> 14:05.971
Any board member wishing to remove items from either of these consent calendars should advise Karen Staff Walters, our Executive Director, by noon today.

14:07.232 --> 14:08.352
Housekeeping announcement.

14:08.913 --> 14:12.455
You have letters from the public on your electronic folder.

14:14.196 --> 14:19.660
There is a full electronic agenda for our meeting and a full print copy in the lobby.

14:20.612 --> 14:25.937
I want to remind the audience that speakers should sign in at a table just outside the room.

14:27.118 --> 14:36.587
Binders are on the table with separate pages for each item number and you need to sign in on the page that identifies the item number on which you wish to speak.

14:37.981 --> 14:57.015
We will allow one minute for all items on the agenda for speakers, both today and tomorrow, except for items one and three, where we will allow a group of five speakers to sign up together and designate one speaker who will be allocated a total of three minutes on behalf of the group.

14:59.797 --> 15:03.659
There'll be a general comment period for items not on our board agenda.

15:03.719 --> 15:05.901
That's item 21 at the end of tomorrow.

15:06.956 --> 15:13.542
If you want to hand things out to the board, provide 25 copies to Amy Bubico, who's sitting in the front there.

15:15.063 --> 15:22.269
When you speak, please introduce yourself and the organization that you represent prior to speaking.

15:24.292 --> 15:31.576
We have additional seating with TV monitors in room 1103 and also in room 1801.

15:33.317 --> 15:34.258
And that's it.

15:34.418 --> 15:45.784
And so I think we're ready now for item 1, which is developing an integrated local, state, and federal accountability and continuous improvement system.

15:46.464 --> 15:49.626
So Cindy Kazanis is here for the department and she will present.

15:52.401 --> 15:55.382
Good morning President Kirsten, Superintendent Torlakson and members of the board.

15:56.162 --> 15:59.924
Cindy Kizana is Director of the Analysis Measurement and Accountability Reporting Division.

16:00.564 --> 16:05.326
This is your standing item for the for the development of the accountability system.

16:05.586 --> 16:11.908
An item that you've heard over the past 16 meetings and so we're building on momentum we've we've had over those meetings.

16:12.528 --> 16:15.770
Today you're going to be asked to to approve two things.

16:16.050 --> 16:22.092
One the suspension of the API and two the expanded definition of alternative schools.

16:31.621 --> 16:34.503
I wanted to touch base briefly on the attachments.

16:34.763 --> 16:40.726
And I'm not going to go to those that you don't have action on in depth, but just wanted to give you a high-level overview of some key points.

16:41.527 --> 16:49.531
So the update on the California School Dashboard, while it was released in March, we still continue to have good usage of the dashboard.

16:49.571 --> 16:51.873
We're continuing to get a lot of hits on the dashboard.

16:51.913 --> 16:57.016
And we currently had inquiries from two other states asking us how we actually set it up and how we paid for it.

16:57.076 --> 17:00.438
And so we're now coming to full circle

17:01.379 --> 17:06.606
getting ready for the operational year of the dashboard, which will happen later this fall.

17:09.895 --> 17:14.097
The focus of the fall dashboard will continue to be on making sure we have the most up-to-date data.

17:14.357 --> 17:17.679
With that in mind, staff are working on processing our discipline files.

17:17.859 --> 17:22.120
So we'll catch up with our years on discipline for the suspension rate.

17:22.521 --> 17:30.244
We also are in the process of developing a report in our student-level data system, CALPADS, which will include the cohort.

17:30.284 --> 17:38.328
So for the first time, districts will be able to see, as they're exiting their students next year at this time, who the students are that are in their cohort.

17:38.968 --> 17:48.616
What this means is we will be able to produce the 2018 graduation rate in 2018, as well as the college career indicator in 2018.

17:49.396 --> 17:52.639
We've typically had a, we've experienced a bit of a delay.

17:53.099 --> 18:04.388
So with this new report and districts being able to see who's actually in the cohort will mean actually a great deal of progress as far as timely data and data reporting in terms of accountability.

18:05.993 --> 18:10.655
Attachment two, we provided you an update on one of our two work groups that we've been staffing for the last couple of months.

18:11.115 --> 18:12.896
This is the college career indicator work group.

18:13.416 --> 18:25.981
And we had originally intended this to be a memo, but we thought it would be important to bring it in as part of the item to show you how important this work is and what progress we are making and what progress we intend to bring you in September.

18:26.041 --> 18:31.064
Keep in mind that September we will bring anything that needs to have action on for the fall dashboard.

18:31.084 --> 18:33.565
You will take those decisions as a whole.

18:34.945 --> 18:45.752
So we intend, as the memo or rather as the attachment said, to add program attributes to allow for consistency and stability over time.

18:46.273 --> 18:55.439
So as opposed to specific programs that would be included in the measures, we're looking at program attributes for the indicator.

18:55.959 --> 19:04.201
We don't intend, just based on lack of data, to add any additional career measures, but we're talking about long-term additions for those.

19:04.681 --> 19:09.023
So we hope to bring in September not only short-term, but long-term recommendations.

19:09.643 --> 19:20.966
And then as far as dashboard reporting for the College Career Indicator, you all are familiar with page seven of attachment to this one pager that tells you if you're prepared or approaching prepared.

19:21.306 --> 19:25.289
For prepared, there are A through E ways of getting to that.

19:25.409 --> 19:34.416
And we hope to, pending staff resources, be able to show you on the dashboard how many of your students reach prepared by those categories.

19:35.496 --> 19:40.540
So we hope that'll add a greater deal of transparency for our schools and districts, as well as the public.

19:46.391 --> 19:51.257
So moving on to the action piece of this item.

19:51.877 --> 20:06.174
At your last meeting, you adopted or rather reaffirmed that the board would add additional schools to the alternative school, what's considered to be alternative school criteria.

20:06.534 --> 20:16.742
So this is the existing criteria that we looked at last meeting and the threshold has been 70% of the school's total enrollment is comprised of these high-risk groups.

20:17.203 --> 20:19.665
You asked us to go back and talk to our task force.

20:19.745 --> 20:26.931
So we had the first meeting of the task force in between our meetings and asked them if these were still the appropriate measures as well as looking at additional measures.

20:28.011 --> 20:31.534
So we had, as you can see, an attachment

20:33.706 --> 20:39.914
Attachment three, the membership of this group is very strong.

20:40.294 --> 20:46.042
In fact, I think some of the letters even commented on the depth of knowledge of the folks on the group.

20:46.442 --> 20:50.247
There are representatives from a lot of the major urban

20:50.367 --> 20:54.610
urban districts as well as rural districts and actually in over representation of charter schools.

20:54.630 --> 20:56.211
So we had a really great meeting.

20:56.592 --> 20:59.474
We're very fortunate to partner with the Gardner Center on this.

20:59.874 --> 21:06.139
They provided us great support and tremendous actually research and just logistics support.

21:06.239 --> 21:10.542
So where we have landed are these seven definitions.

21:11.483 --> 21:26.656
And just to, again, this is expanding the current definition of what the board has determined to be alternative schools, expanding from the 2003 definition, looking at students who are recovered dropouts, students who are credit deficient.

21:26.936 --> 21:30.699
The task force had a very strong opinion that you shouldn't leave students behind.

21:30.739 --> 21:34.582
And so they thought that the one year credit deficiency was too long to wait.

21:34.702 --> 21:35.923
You should look at one semester.

21:36.704 --> 21:39.866
students with a gap in enrollment, students with high level of transiency.

21:39.886 --> 21:42.107
I wanted to comment on this particular one.

21:42.507 --> 21:50.272
We are moving towards student level based reporting in DataQuest.

21:50.292 --> 21:57.155
And what this will allow us to do with forthcoming reports is to actually report on stuff such as transiency.

21:57.176 --> 22:02.559
So we're looking at a mobility report in future development of our DataQuest overhaul.

22:03.559 --> 22:08.500
We also suggest adding foster youth, homeless youth, and emotionally disturbed students.

22:08.900 --> 22:17.342
So there are some of these that we can't tell you how many schools will be added because we actually don't know who the students are that are being enrolled in these schools.

22:17.402 --> 22:30.005
And so just like in May when you adopted that schools would have to reapply every three years, this is upon the school to take action to actually apply to be part of the alternative school system.

22:30.325 --> 22:32.166
They don't automatically get put in there unless

22:32.526 --> 22:34.067
they're actually part of the education code.

22:34.087 --> 22:36.688
So just I want to make sure that you're aware of that nuance.

22:37.889 --> 22:50.697
The last part of this, and this is one piece that we took to your special education advisory committee this past month, and it was about district-run special education schools.

22:51.137 --> 22:58.141
So in education code, it specifies that county-run special education schools are automatically considered alternative schools.

22:58.581 --> 23:01.463
There are, however, 79 district-operated schools.

23:02.003 --> 23:18.431
And what the Commission on Special Education suggested is as opposed to automatically including those 79 schools in as alternative schools, they should also be asked to apply unless they meet a threshold that 70% of their students participate in the California Alternate Assessment.

23:19.071 --> 23:24.013
So this diagram was not in your board item, but I wanted to make sure that you knew what this meant.

23:24.173 --> 23:33.315
So of the 79, 30 of those have students, 70% of their students have taken the California Alternate Assessment.

23:34.196 --> 23:35.256
That represents 22 LEAs.

23:40.703 --> 23:44.586
So with that, this is the recommendation for the item.

23:45.127 --> 23:48.790
I'm going to just skip ahead before you open up for discussion.

23:48.830 --> 24:00.040
And I wanted to just tease you for next month or rather for next meeting, which is we do have a big meeting in September for LCFF and for the dashboard.

24:00.761 --> 24:05.465
So in anticipation of that, we will be providing you a very lengthy memoranda.

24:06.465 --> 24:09.266
in August to talk about the actions that you'll take.

24:09.407 --> 24:14.809
You'll look at the English learner proficiency indicator, the college career indicator.

24:15.329 --> 24:23.012
We have had our first of two discussions with small school representatives looking at how we can make the accountability system more fair to schools that are 250 students or less.

24:24.833 --> 24:26.474
And then we're also looking at the three-year average.

24:26.994 --> 24:33.278
There are a couple of decisions we know we won't be able to bring you in September, because we won't be able to complete the data simulations to inform your decision.

24:33.738 --> 24:42.984
So those will be the academic indicator, along with the California alternate assessment and how to incorporate that into the academic indicator, as well as the chronic absenteeism data.

24:43.324 --> 24:51.429
So it'll be a two-parter as far as making decisions, which is why the dashboard release is currently scheduled for early December.

24:51.449 --> 24:52.549
It's still fall.

24:53.730 --> 24:58.359
So with that I am happy to return it back to you President Kirks for any questions.

24:59.361 --> 25:01.044
Other Board Member questions on this?

25:01.905 --> 25:02.567
Board Member Burr.

25:04.997 --> 25:05.717
Thank you, Cindy.

25:06.058 --> 25:13.182
And just before my questions, again, express my appreciation to you and your entire staff for all of the hard work.

25:13.302 --> 25:20.666
For people who are following along and reading all of this information, you can see how much work is going into this and data simulations.

25:20.846 --> 25:26.469
And I really appreciate the level of transparency that you and Jenny and others are able to bring forward.

25:26.509 --> 25:27.730
So thank you for that.

25:28.750 --> 25:32.291
I just wanted to clarify a little bit about the college and career indicator.

25:33.332 --> 25:40.074
The way I read the attachment, we're struggling a lot around the career questions of, you know, what should count, what shouldn't.

25:40.594 --> 25:51.178
But most of the academic indicators that are in there around AP and the other things that are shown in that table about prepared, well-prepared, approaching prepared are available.

25:51.878 --> 26:09.358
So can you just preview a little bit about what will be in the dashboard for the college and career indicator, meaning I know we'll have the status, right, how that will look, and also just clarify how we will continue to report and what new data will be available about grade 11 SBAC.

26:11.760 --> 26:16.243
Sure, so this past year we didn't have the benefit of having status.

26:16.463 --> 26:26.609
And this year, assuming that you all approve what we recommend or a version of what we recommend in September, you will see status for the first time in the status and change report.

26:26.949 --> 26:31.592
And why this is important is this is the first cohort to have Smarter Balanced scores.

26:31.712 --> 26:37.435
So our grade 11 students have finally graduated and we now have two years of data to use.

26:39.076 --> 26:41.997
So with that, we have one year of data to use.

26:42.017 --> 26:44.718
So with that in mind, we're able to produce a status report.

26:45.538 --> 26:58.041
In addition, we will continue to report out the grade 11 scores, because there has been a strong interest from the field and I think from schools and districts to be transparent about how their students are doing academically in high school.

26:58.381 --> 26:59.901
So that link will be available as well.

27:00.021 --> 27:07.003
And then third, we will, in the detailed reports, which is what we're going to be working on over the next couple of weeks or month or so,

27:07.643 --> 27:10.486
is how to report out how students are prepared.

27:10.547 --> 27:15.072
Right now, what we've done in the detailed reports is just show a bulk number.

27:15.172 --> 27:20.137
So everybody gets put into, this is how many students are prepared at your school.

27:20.197 --> 27:23.781
Now we're able to show you how they met each of those pieces.

27:26.123 --> 27:47.770
It is correct that we are challenged with collecting additional data on the career side, but I know that the group that we've assembled will be meeting this next Monday and hopefully they've got some new ideas or we can balance the discussions we've developed over the last couple of weeks since we last met with them to see if what we've put together will work for future collections.

27:50.666 --> 28:07.171
And then on the other topic about the alternative schools, the listing of categories of students that will be considered for purposes of alternative schools, is there a threshold, for example, for foster youth or homeless youth or

28:08.551 --> 28:12.413
Were we just going to consider if you're serving foster kids, you're going to be in the alternative?

28:12.773 --> 28:13.874
No, that's a good point.

28:13.934 --> 28:19.936
So this still has to meet the same definition as the prior high risk definition, the 70% threshold.

28:20.337 --> 28:24.899
And the 70% threshold, I think you had asked about at last meeting, and we did take that to the task force.

28:25.339 --> 28:33.783
And they at first struggled with it, but then they were very affirmative that this is, it's a privilege to be a part of this system.

28:34.023 --> 28:34.883
These are high stakes,

28:36.164 --> 28:38.366
high stakes, high stakes accountability.

28:38.526 --> 28:50.454
And so, you know, to be to be out of the system and removed from the general accountability system and have these special measures for just your school was a big deal.

28:50.594 --> 28:54.116
So the 70 percent threshold was something that they felt strongly about in the end.

28:54.716 --> 29:00.660
And we are bringing forward these additional categories with that same threshold, with 70 percent of the student population.

29:00.700 --> 29:06.004
So it doesn't necessarily have to be 70 percent of foster youth, it'd be of all students enrolled and how they got in.

29:07.404 --> 29:09.205
Okay, Board Member Holliday.

29:10.565 --> 29:12.106
It's a combination of... You're right.

29:12.246 --> 29:14.426
Yeah, that's just wanted to clarify that.

29:14.746 --> 29:23.969
Also, the Ed Code list of schools that are automatically considered alternative schools, that remains intact.

29:24.109 --> 29:25.530
That remains intact, yes.

29:25.810 --> 29:30.191
And if a school is not one of these schools,

29:31.371 --> 29:33.173
in that list, then they have to apply.

29:33.273 --> 29:34.194
They would have to apply.

29:34.254 --> 29:39.939
And we've had a couple of applications over the last couple of months, and there was a question from one of our stakeholders, do they have to reapply?

29:39.999 --> 29:47.326
And I think if it's a very recent application, we would consider them to have met, assuming they met the criteria.

29:48.847 --> 29:50.569
would automatically consider them as part of an alternative school.

29:50.589 --> 30:01.777
We will be sending out a communication this week, you know, following your decision to all schools in all districts and charter school administrators about the opportunity to apply if they meet this criteria.

30:01.797 --> 30:02.518
That was another question.

30:02.538 --> 30:06.501
You've got the PR approach in mind for it, right?

30:06.641 --> 30:17.871
We definitely do, and we will be contacting anybody who has applied in the past and was either, whether it became an alternative school or for whatever reason was denied, we would contact them as well, especially.

30:17.951 --> 30:29.102
And the schools that don't fit under the Ed Code list that have to apply, it doesn't matter whether they are district schools or whether they're charter schools or whether

30:30.122 --> 30:31.443
That's correct.

30:31.463 --> 30:43.312
It does not matter who runs the school, but there is a process in which you need to self-identify that you've met and that there has been, you know, certain approvals been made at the administrative level.

30:43.993 --> 30:44.333
Thank you.

30:46.154 --> 30:46.675
Member Philippe.

30:47.195 --> 30:47.976
Ortiz-Lacon.

30:50.453 --> 30:50.913
Thank you.

30:51.814 --> 30:58.479
When it comes to the alternative accountability system, I definitely understand the need for it, but I also want us to be mindful as we implement.

30:59.160 --> 31:10.608
If we start seeing that enrollment rates for 11th and 12th graders in the alternative system, I think that should give us, we should question why that's happening and why those particular grades.

31:10.989 --> 31:17.534
It seems like the studies show that that is really where we're capturing students is that they're transferring to alternative in 11th and 12th grade.

31:17.574 --> 31:18.875
So we want to be mindful of that.

31:20.096 --> 31:29.044
In terms of the college career readiness indicator, one of the things that I still haven't seen is the number of students participating in AP courses.

31:29.184 --> 31:33.067
Not only who's passing the AP exam, but who's participating.

31:33.388 --> 31:34.929
And I think that speaks to access.

31:34.989 --> 31:41.815
And we really should be mindful of who has access to these AP courses, who is enrolling in AP courses.

31:42.175 --> 31:45.578
And I'm sure there's going to be some disparities that we would need to consider.

31:47.099 --> 31:59.305
In terms of the data dashboard, I appreciate that we're considering the feedback of stakeholders and improving the functionality and in particular that we're improving the translation for Spanish.

31:59.946 --> 32:06.269
But I also inquired about revamping the equity report display so that it really speaks to

32:07.029 --> 32:13.391
equity, and I think that every single one of those tabs, the goal should be to align it to its purpose, right?

32:13.431 --> 32:22.675
So, for equity, the goal was to align it so that folks knew who is not, where are the achievement gaps, who's not at the same level as the all groups category.

32:23.155 --> 32:25.976
And that's still being lost a little bit in the current display.

32:26.116 --> 32:29.097
So, I'm not sure if there's any plans to revamp that particular page.

32:30.238 --> 32:30.438
Is there?

32:31.401 --> 32:43.434
So we are taking forward these next couple of weeks some mock-ups, but I think what we've indicated in the item, as well as the attachment, that we want to make sure there's some stability in the system.

32:43.854 --> 32:46.957
So I don't anticipate wholesale changes to the equity report.

32:47.038 --> 32:48.319
There may be some nuanced changes.

32:49.380 --> 32:56.622
I remember Holidays asked a couple of times about moving the narrative up to the top, so we want to make sure that we take that to the field and see what that looks like.

32:56.662 --> 33:07.605
But there's been a lot of training materials produced and some in progress, and so we want to make sure that there's some stability in the dashboard as we go fully operational this fall, at least for the next year.

33:07.805 --> 33:12.527
So I think as we keep getting out in the field and talking to

33:13.027 --> 33:29.997
to parents and to teachers, and I know CCEE is anticipating doing a really strong outreach to parents on the dashboard in the fall, that we can, some of those things we need to make sure that we've bookmarked so when we're ready for a revamp in 2018 that we have the list ready to go.

33:30.057 --> 33:36.761
But I think wholesale, you will see a lot of similarities as we currently have, especially for that landing page.

33:37.962 --> 33:41.583
And then I just wanted to make sure that I represent this correctly.

33:41.903 --> 33:45.064
We are not developing an alternative schools accountability system.

33:45.284 --> 33:48.324
It is integrated in the dashboard, is integrated in our current system.

33:48.404 --> 33:52.825
We will develop indicators that are appropriate for alternative schools, but it's not a separate system.

33:54.265 --> 34:00.827
Yeah, I just wanted to comment on the AP comment that the board member McCollum made.

34:01.767 --> 34:06.208
I wrote an article in EdSource about three years ago and we're working on a new one.

34:06.772 --> 34:13.136
which on the AP performance of California students, it's really quite impressive and it gets no general media.

34:14.297 --> 34:21.521
We're now fifth in the nation in the percentage passing with three or more and our Hispanics were third in the nation.

34:22.148 --> 34:24.790
in terms of the percentage passing with three or more.

34:24.910 --> 34:28.312
And our rates of taking AP are going up very rapidly.

34:29.053 --> 34:31.974
So I think this is something that flies under the radar.

34:32.195 --> 34:38.899
And so I think that the dashboard will enhance this and draw more attention to this.

34:38.979 --> 34:43.382
It's really quite interesting how we're doing in that regard.

34:43.442 --> 34:44.342
So that's a comment.

34:44.382 --> 34:44.582
Yes.

34:45.003 --> 34:45.223
Yeah.

34:46.698 --> 34:52.582
So, I don't know if you looked by district or if it was statewide, but... I looked statewide.

34:52.663 --> 34:54.004
I only have statewide numbers.

34:54.144 --> 34:54.584
Okay.

34:54.684 --> 35:04.051
So if, my concern would be, yes, of the people that are taking, the students that are taking the AP, maybe Latinos are surfacing and you said the third largest.

35:04.071 --> 35:05.172
They are going up, yes.

35:05.592 --> 35:14.818
But if we have a district with 75% Latino students, I'm wondering what percent of those students are taking AP because then we're filtering down to a percentage.

35:14.918 --> 35:18.320
So from that percent, some of them or the majority may be passing.

35:18.721 --> 35:25.265
But if that percent of participation is only 15% and you have a population of 75%, that's an issue.

35:25.705 --> 35:32.610
And so I would want to see what percent are participating and then from the participants, what percent are actually passing.

35:33.328 --> 35:43.290
Yeah, and we don't want to get into this now, but you will be able to, you have, I know you've been working with district data on AP.

35:43.630 --> 35:59.553
We have student level data on AP, but I think what student level data, but I think what member Ortiz-Lacon is asking is, if I understand you correctly, is to make a crosswalk of those that are actually enrolled and complete the courses, whether or not they're passing the exams.

36:01.047 --> 36:01.347
No.

36:01.867 --> 36:06.050
I want to know how many are participating, how many have access to the actual courses.

36:06.450 --> 36:10.472
And then from those, then we want to filter more and see how many of them are passing.

36:11.393 --> 36:11.653
Yeah.

36:11.753 --> 36:18.296
So that would be the numbers, that total numbers taking the courses was what you're interested in as well.

36:18.877 --> 36:19.197
Yes.

36:19.517 --> 36:19.897
Okay.

36:20.357 --> 36:21.558
Board member Rucker was next.

36:24.281 --> 36:25.001
Well, good morning.

36:25.141 --> 36:33.046
And I also want to add my commendations to the work that clearly is going on to develop and continue to mature the accountability system.

36:33.386 --> 36:36.527
But I also do have some questions and some concerns.

36:36.928 --> 36:49.094
My concerns really revolve around the issue of granularity, but also on I'm falling in love with this word since it's been added to the Oxford English Dictionary, woke.

36:50.275 --> 36:59.503
I think that we need to be aware of when we look at disproportionality, it's not just an issue that's related to special education.

37:00.024 --> 37:14.197
So when we look at the college and career indicator, I understand we're still struggling with the career indicators, but let me suggest we're also still struggling in some ways to understand the academic portion of the indicator as well.

37:14.577 --> 37:31.464
because it's not just the AP courses that are being considered and represented, but for students that are going to dual enrollment programs, the indicator still has not caught up with the variety of types of dual enrollment options that students have.

37:31.844 --> 37:43.529
The focus on dual enrollment seems to still be on students who are enrolled in dual enrollment courses for academic pursuits, but there are options now that students have for dual enrollment

37:43.809 --> 37:47.312
that are directly related to college and career readiness as well.

37:48.032 --> 38:11.830
There are also options that are included for early college programs that are not because they have different titles or different names across the LEAs and there are different partnerships between many LEAs and community colleges that indicators doesn't quite take in that level of diversity because it's still not drilling down in a level of granularity that would show or share that.

38:13.151 --> 38:27.254
The reason why that becomes important is because with each of the different diverse types of options for that dual enrollment, there's a greater diversity of students who have access to and are able to participate in those programs.

38:27.574 --> 38:31.715
And that's not being really well reflected in this indicator.

38:31.755 --> 38:33.276
So that's my first concern.

38:33.896 --> 38:37.717
And then when we get to the other half of the indicator looking at career,

38:38.337 --> 38:40.340
I'm really impressed with California.

38:40.400 --> 38:45.966
I'm always impressed by the fact that this is a state where the law of large numbers makes us look really impressive.

38:46.347 --> 38:53.375
So I'm impressed by the thousands of courses that have been identified that would fall into the indicator.

38:54.437 --> 38:57.802
What doesn't impress me, however, is nobody knows what that means.

38:58.623 --> 39:10.781
And so, because we don't really understand what that means, nobody knows how to disaggregate that information, how to look at the level of granularity on that information to distinguish

39:11.341 --> 39:30.215
whether those courses are being classified as an academic course, if they're being classified to a particular industry sector, if they are different as an introductory course, if they are part of a sequence of four courses that lead to some type of prerequisite certification, that's not really made clear.

39:31.156 --> 39:46.205
And but the fact of the matter is while we may say at this level in the atmosphere that we don't know what that information is, the districts that are reporting those classes or that place those classes on their master schedule do know.

39:46.625 --> 39:52.028
And I don't believe it takes another category in CALPADS for us to figure that out.

39:52.389 --> 39:57.492
I think there are ways to identify what's already in CALPADS to do this.

39:57.532 --> 39:59.093
And the reason I'm suggesting that

40:00.174 --> 40:04.699
and I'm surprised I'm about to say this, the University of California somehow is able to figure this out.

40:05.219 --> 40:14.729
And so I suggest that we look at what other entities are doing to help them do this analysis in a way that we seem not to be able to do.

40:14.749 --> 40:22.777
The University of California not only has figured this out, but through the Office of the President, they are even working directly with those school districts to help them

40:23.237 --> 40:33.808
make sure they're appropriately classifying and identifying their courses, not only to meet the A to G, but to make sure that there are clear linkages among each of the post-secondary segments.

40:33.848 --> 40:43.698
So I think that there's work that can be done that will address some of the issues that are clearly identified in the item that's causing a struggle on the CCI.

40:44.079 --> 40:45.180
But I think that

40:45.620 --> 40:56.944
Well, I'm glad to know we have thousands of courses that are out there because that does suggest there's a great amount of access and a greater level of awareness about college and career readiness.

40:57.384 --> 41:05.948
What it doesn't say or what it actually highlights more to the point is we don't know how to explain what all those numbers actually mean.

41:06.388 --> 41:14.751
And so as the work continues to mature the indicator and when you come back to talk to us in September, even when you develop the memo,

41:15.531 --> 41:25.139
One of the things that I would really like to ask you to do is to help us understand how the system will mature to take those on.

41:25.179 --> 41:38.170
There needs to—the discomfort, I believe, that I'm feeling, and I'm hoping I'm mirroring or reflecting what others would feel, is the sense that we don't know what we're doing still on this.

41:38.750 --> 41:49.072
and we are getting into the point where this dashboard now becomes a part not only of important planning in the LCFF, but at some point becomes an accountability tool.

41:49.473 --> 41:51.693
And I'm being careful to say tool, not weapon.

41:52.033 --> 42:03.976
But if we're not careful on how we quantify this information and how the analysis, how districts are guided to use this information, particularly high schools, looking at this indicator, we are going to miss

42:04.876 --> 42:14.964
not only the performance of students, but we are going to miss the kind of reporting about the work that students are doing as they leave high school that is important for doing planning.

42:15.364 --> 42:31.316
Because even though we are doing these cohort, the cohort graduation rate, which is a separate but connected indicator to this, the fact is the planning that leads to improving the graduation rate begins before these students become a part of that cohort.

42:31.676 --> 42:50.465
So I guess my point is on the college and career indicator, other schools other than high schools are the ones who will be better informed about what the indicator says because they're the ones doing the prerequisite work that informs what high schools can actually provide as a deliverable that's directly related to this indicator.

42:50.765 --> 42:56.248
And I think that part of the system is not clearly as well spelled out or articulated.

42:56.588 --> 42:58.509
And I'll stop on my comments on that.

42:58.529 --> 43:00.070
Do you want to respond?

43:00.670 --> 43:07.958
One thing I wanted to respond to, we did have a separate conversation about this with member Rucker, and this is very helpful as well.

43:08.339 --> 43:14.465
We are engaged with, or we have a joint grant from IES, from the U.S.

43:14.485 --> 43:20.332
Department of the Federal Government with McCall Kurlanders from UC Davis, and Professor Kurlander does have some

43:21.012 --> 43:24.493
graduate students this summer looking at the course issues.

43:25.213 --> 43:32.895
So while I think it's a bit dismal in our report and the item about we have all these courses, there's no consistency.

43:33.535 --> 43:39.657
The state has not, we talked about this back in a memo to you in December of this last year about the challenges with courses.

43:40.377 --> 43:42.959
and cataloging those.

43:43.319 --> 43:44.299
We are doing a roadshow.

43:44.379 --> 43:53.084
We have been doing this roadshow now, I think, for the last couple of months between our program office and the CALPADS office on how to better submit data on CTE specifically.

43:53.504 --> 44:08.493
So, you know, we are trying to do the best we can with the resources we have, but that said, we are expanding our resources by leveraging things like, you know, the IES grant that we were so fortunate to get, which is a five-year grant, and we're just finishing up year one.

44:09.333 --> 44:15.714
I do see a lot of promise with that and if we can incorporate any of their findings for the September item, we will try to do that.

44:15.954 --> 44:17.575
If it's not in the item, we'll do it verbally.

44:17.695 --> 44:23.216
But Professor Kurlander is on our task force as well for the College Career Indicator.

44:23.476 --> 44:27.337
Yeah, that's why I made that comment because I thought it was really important for you to explain that.

44:27.377 --> 44:27.797
Thank you.

44:27.917 --> 44:31.797
No, it's a good reminder and we need to talk more about that in the future.

44:32.378 --> 44:34.378
These kinds of partnerships are really invaluable.

44:34.798 --> 44:39.222
Yeah, the IES is the Institute for Educational Sciences of the U.S.

44:39.262 --> 44:40.483
Department of Education.

44:40.563 --> 44:42.225
It's their research arm for those.

44:42.885 --> 44:43.726
Board member Strauss.

44:43.746 --> 44:48.610
So I wanted to continue the conversation on college and career before we go to public comments.

44:48.670 --> 44:53.775
And first, thank you and the work group that's working so hard on this complicated issue.

44:54.455 --> 44:59.780
I believe that the components of the college career and the issue of being approaching prepared or prepared

45:00.300 --> 45:02.341
or well-prepared are really important.

45:02.441 --> 45:15.107
And what we know about our work with API is as we've added indicators, it's actually helped to cause districts and schools to do things like add science in ninth grade because there was a consequence if you didn't or put students in algebra.

45:15.528 --> 45:20.010
And so the things that we pay attention to in college career are really important.

45:20.390 --> 45:28.855
And what we know about high schools, they're really complicated places and the trajectory for kids over a four-year period is, has lots of, it's an interesting ride.

45:29.235 --> 45:35.299
And there are lots of issues, as Member Ortiz-Lincoe brought up, where students start to get in real credit trouble by the end of 10th grade.

45:35.319 --> 45:38.261
So when you get to 11th grade, the kids that are in credit trouble often

45:38.701 --> 45:41.242
are looking to continuation and alternative ed programs.

45:41.642 --> 45:46.384
We also know that the issue of counseling advisement for AP access is really critical.

45:47.204 --> 45:56.487
And I actually would like some time spent down the road on advising and working with counselors to help understand the philosophy of helping kids have options, not closing off options.

45:56.907 --> 46:03.730
But the concern I have on the college and career is I understand the challenges on career tech and I really appreciate the work that you're doing with that.

46:04.350 --> 46:10.394
But the components of the College and Career Indicator together are going to give us a College and Career Indicator rating.

46:11.194 --> 46:24.242
But within it, I think we have to look down the line and I'd be interested if the work group is going to look at this as to whether we might want to in some of our revisions, think about pulling out some of that data so it's a little bit easier for people to see.

46:24.662 --> 46:27.584
So the access issue of access to rigorous coursework,

46:27.984 --> 46:31.085
the issue of dual enrollment that member Rucker brought up.

46:32.245 --> 46:38.047
All the different components which are giving us a compilation of a single score are one measure.

46:38.447 --> 46:40.527
But individually, there are other issues.

46:40.567 --> 46:45.688
I know you're going to be working on a high school readiness issue coming up that's down the line in a project.

46:46.028 --> 46:54.090
So I just wonder if there's any consideration and I guess I'd like to put on the table that in potential revisions coming up, as we've said, this is not in cement.

46:54.130 --> 46:55.771
We're going to continue to work on the process.

46:56.491 --> 47:11.908
I think it might be more helpful to think down the line about a college and career indicator about a student being prepared or well prepared, but also pulling out some of the data so that schools and stakeholders can use some of that to help inform practice.

47:11.928 --> 47:16.373
So I wonder if we're thinking down the line about pulling any of those things out as

47:16.993 --> 47:26.337
And again, not for a hammer or a weapon, but more for informing practice so that it's, you get the compilation of a rating, but you also get some issues of, oh, my goodness.

47:26.917 --> 47:33.620
Because getting kids access to A to G, just saying that that's important, high schools are starting to create different pathways for students.

47:33.880 --> 47:36.121
They're starting to drop non-college prep.

47:36.401 --> 47:45.747
There's definitely, just like we did when we put students in science in ninth grade, as a result of saying that was a priority, the access to A to G is now raising the awareness for schools to increase that.

47:46.047 --> 47:49.629
So I guess my point is, I think this is really important.

47:49.649 --> 47:59.154
I think high schools are so complex that I'm wondering whether we're thinking about pulling any of the pieces out in the long run to help inform and share the information.

48:00.634 --> 48:06.638
We will definitely add that to our list of things to keep looking at over the next couple of years.

48:07.518 --> 48:11.481
Right now we are, I think as you've pointed out, we're focused on completion.

48:12.162 --> 48:16.985
And in order to move to access and enrollment, it's a different conversation.

48:19.847 --> 48:23.210
We would be different approach and we definitely can definitely look into that.

48:23.290 --> 48:28.314
But also to your point, the accountability systems do change behavior and we're very cognizant of that.

48:28.334 --> 48:30.356
We want to be cautious with how we proceed with that.

48:30.376 --> 48:41.365
So we want to make sure we did the right level of stakeholder input and we definitely would involve our technical design group to advise on the technical aspects of how we would include that into the indicator as well.

48:41.445 --> 48:43.147
But your points are well taken.

48:43.467 --> 48:43.767
Thank you.

48:43.787 --> 48:45.289
Board Member Sun.

48:46.291 --> 49:03.932
So along the lines of the maturity of our indices and as we're developing and looking at this as well, I think somewhat to what Member Stroud was talking about, as we put more components into these indices and sometimes they can also wash

49:04.352 --> 49:05.893
each other out as well.

49:06.033 --> 49:12.155
So this idea of getting a holistic picture and then balancing it with what are some of the specifics.

49:12.515 --> 49:20.998
And as we continue to develop, I don't think we should be closed to the idea of perhaps maybe we need to continue to tweak or prioritize or weigh.

49:21.878 --> 49:26.600
I just don't want us to close ourselves from thinking about those as this system matures.

49:28.524 --> 49:29.425
Board Member Holliday.

49:30.246 --> 49:38.333
And to your last point about being careful to not influence decisions inappropriately.

49:38.814 --> 49:49.384
In terms of access to AP, it's wonderful the numbers, the high statistics, but for many families dual enrollment is

49:49.983 --> 49:53.304
a much more beneficial route for their child.

49:53.985 --> 50:07.750
In my experience in schools is that children of families whose parents went to college, the AP is very much within their philosophy and their thinking, but for a lot of families,

50:08.562 --> 50:18.408
whose parents were not in post-secondary education, dual enrollment makes a lot of sense in their way of thinking and in my way of thinking as well.

50:18.989 --> 50:28.215
And we have to be careful about stressing AP when it could disadvantage students who really would benefit from dual enrollment in really important ways.

50:28.275 --> 50:31.657
So good you're thinking about all that.

50:31.737 --> 50:32.057
Thank you.

50:33.218 --> 50:35.259
The other point I wanted to ask about was

50:36.560 --> 50:38.001
back to the alternative schools.

50:38.581 --> 50:44.804
The work on the indicators for alternative schools has begun.

50:44.824 --> 50:45.664
It has begun.

50:46.205 --> 50:48.206
And is it with the same task force?

50:48.226 --> 50:48.446
Same group.

50:48.986 --> 50:49.166
Right.

50:49.626 --> 50:53.368
And I'm sure they're much smarter about this than I am, but my

50:56.023 --> 51:02.525
experiences that change is the factor that has to be most prominent.

51:03.226 --> 51:06.367
Growth, improvement or lack of improvement.

51:06.427 --> 51:13.629
That is the key to, you know, wherever they are, how well are they progressing?

51:13.690 --> 51:19.832
And I assume that that will be a strong part of their putting this together, right?

51:20.772 --> 51:21.012
Thanks.

51:22.333 --> 51:23.133
Board Member Sandoval.

51:25.058 --> 51:29.342
Just to the alternative schools, thank you for all the work and the task force too.

51:29.382 --> 51:35.046
I think that the proposed additions to the high-risk definitions make good sense.

51:35.086 --> 51:47.977
They reflect clear thinking, responsiveness to the stakeholders, and I'm glad that at the Advisory Commission on Special Education there was time devoted to this because I feel that the commissioners made really good recommendations.

51:48.613 --> 51:56.755
And I want to thank you for incorporating those recommendations and showing us the number of LEAs who are automatically part of that group.

51:57.275 --> 52:01.796
And I also want to acknowledge the point that you made that this is one accountability system.

52:02.396 --> 52:08.237
And we don't want to be confused about having a separate system for alternative schools.

52:08.317 --> 52:15.059
So just I wanted to commend the task force and the work that you've done in this division in moving this forward.

52:18.365 --> 52:20.467
Okay, public comment, but one more.

52:20.707 --> 52:21.948
Member Burke.

52:22.149 --> 52:24.832
And I hope this is an easy fix, Cindy.

52:24.852 --> 52:26.193
So that's what I'm looking for.

52:26.994 --> 52:39.848
In the college and career indicator, when I look at, you know, all of the different categories, I think just to this conversation about whether or not it's useful at the LEA level or especially at the school level.

52:40.509 --> 52:48.730
Well, is there a detailed report or will there be a detailed report that says this is how many students meet this particular category?

52:51.311 --> 52:55.493
Yes, that is our... Because I wonder if that kind of addresses member Strauss.

52:55.513 --> 53:03.558
I just want to be clear that we always have these kind of high level things where people and we hope will be helpful to the public, helpful to parents, etc.

53:04.198 --> 53:08.781
But for purposes of LEA planning and understanding what's there.

53:08.921 --> 53:11.062
First of all, they're the ones reporting the data.

53:11.102 --> 53:11.903
So they have it.

53:12.683 --> 53:17.527
But secondly, that we're then turning back around and saying, yeah, here's a detailed report.

53:17.547 --> 53:22.011
It's important for you to know what happened in this year with your students, what happened in the subsequent years.

53:22.411 --> 53:28.656
Yes, I think this indicator is very different than all the rest of the indicators in that there are several components to it.

53:28.676 --> 53:34.201
And so this is the feedback to your point that we've received is it would be helpful to see who makes this up.

53:34.321 --> 53:37.223
So that is our intent.

53:37.284 --> 53:41.327
Again, staffing and resources willing that we can put this out for the fall release.

53:43.285 --> 53:44.446
Board Member Ortiz-Lacon.

53:45.447 --> 53:49.271
I just need to ask a clarifying question because we, you know, I've heard it twice.

53:49.291 --> 53:53.456
This is one accountability system for alternative youth and for our students.

53:54.136 --> 54:00.343
But are we saying, because if it was one, we wouldn't be having subsequent meetings about what indicators that would be.

54:00.843 --> 54:07.727
But what I'm hearing is that we want it to be one coherent system so that the indicators we identify will align with the state indicators that we have.

54:08.247 --> 54:18.312
But it is one in the same way that we have LCFF and ESSA misalignment and now we're also going to incorporate alternative indicators for alternative youth that meet the criteria.

54:18.733 --> 54:21.614
So it's one in the sense that it's all going to be in the same dashboard.

54:22.074 --> 54:25.076
But it's not one in the sense that they will be meeting the same

54:25.777 --> 54:30.223
state goals and the same indicators as the one that we're currently adopting.

54:30.243 --> 54:31.625
Is that correct?

54:32.026 --> 54:39.297
I want to make sure that we're having a very transparent conversation and what we mean by one system for alternative or high-risk youth.

54:40.282 --> 54:45.705
I think what we see the dashboard as being is the major component of the accountability system.

54:45.745 --> 54:47.005
It's our accountability toolkit.

54:47.065 --> 54:49.566
And so this is going to be part of that toolkit.

54:49.586 --> 54:52.028
I'm not going to have a separate toolkit for just alternative schools.

54:52.048 --> 54:54.149
You will see this all in the same location.

54:54.509 --> 54:55.269
The one dashboard.

54:56.330 --> 54:56.550
Yes.

54:57.010 --> 54:58.851
That's what we mean by one accountability system.

54:58.871 --> 54:59.091
Thanks.

55:01.692 --> 55:01.892
Okay.

55:01.932 --> 55:03.333
I think we're ready for the public comment.

55:09.028 --> 55:10.870
Would the following people please line up?

55:11.430 --> 55:36.310
Diana Cruz, Hector Castaneda, Jordi McCorpuz, Zekia Armstrong, Doug McCray, Carrie Mazzoni, Sasha Horwitz, Roberto Viramontes, Diane Georgian, Liz Guillen, Mary Lee, Colin Miller, Martha Alvarez, Ralph Porras, Lisa Morris, and Kristi Sinclair.

55:41.055 --> 55:43.896
Thank you Mr. President, Superintendent, and members.

55:44.276 --> 55:46.457
Carrie Mazzoni for Opportunities for Learning.

55:47.237 --> 55:55.540
We are in great support of the new criteria for alternative schools and we've been part of a group that has been working on this.

55:55.620 --> 56:02.543
We want to thank the department for their serious consideration of our recommendations and we hope that you concur with the department.

56:02.583 --> 56:02.863
Thank you.

56:11.428 --> 56:11.788
Good morning.

56:12.108 --> 56:13.009
I'm Diane Groucho.

56:13.029 --> 56:15.730
I'm with the Coalition for Alternative Education Accountability.

56:16.490 --> 56:27.574
And primarily, I just want to applaud the Department of Education, Cindy and Jenny, who just worked on this whole revision and the alternative county piece for an awful long time.

56:29.014 --> 56:34.856
And we also want to say that we are in total support of the revisions as they say, as they propose.

56:34.897 --> 56:36.117
So thank you very much.

56:41.407 --> 56:41.828
Good morning.

56:41.868 --> 56:45.030
I'm Doug McRae, retired measurement specialist from NRA.

56:45.590 --> 56:53.875
For the June memo on growth model plans referenced in this item, I included a number of detailed observations and materials submitted to your electronic folder.

56:54.476 --> 57:09.145
Briefly summarize, simple absolute growth models are often better than complex growth models like the relative or projected models, both for communication reasons and avoiding technical problems generated by that additional complexity.

57:09.825 --> 57:17.268
However, accountability use requires separating elementary from middle from high schools for growth model data.

57:17.828 --> 57:31.493
For all growth models, beware of the effects of mobility that can eliminate too many student scores from the analyses, particularly for underserved students like English learners and low wealth students, thus generating unsatisfactory results.

57:32.153 --> 57:40.397
The material in the electronic folder also contains alternative simulations to further investigate appropriate growth models for California.

57:41.298 --> 57:41.578
Thank you.

57:48.049 --> 57:51.090
President Kersten, members, I'm Sasha Horwitz with the Link Learning Alliance.

57:51.610 --> 57:59.392
As the board and CDE have developed out the college career indicator, we've been insistent that it should include a well-prepared tier that integrates college and career measures.

57:59.953 --> 58:08.135
We appreciate the department's cautiousness in making sure that all the tiers are meaningful and reflective of actual measures of readiness, but we don't want the perfect to be the enemy of the good.

58:08.155 --> 58:14.077
As board member Rucker said, we all recognize that academic indicators are not perfect, but that hasn't kept us from using them.

58:14.637 --> 58:24.631
And since the dashboard is designed to capture status and change and also to make that information publicly available, we think it's important that schools have the information they need to make decisions based on that information.

58:24.651 --> 58:30.278
And as board member Strauss said, this would incentivize schools to offer courses that prepare students for college and career.

58:30.579 --> 58:30.799
Thank you.

58:37.856 --> 58:38.997
Good morning, board members.

58:39.438 --> 58:43.542
My name is Mary Lee, and I'm a parent ambassador with Families in Schools.

58:44.083 --> 58:51.010
And I wanted to address the alternative schools, the indicator that you were speaking on.

58:51.371 --> 58:58.719
And I did agree with several points that I heard board member Ortiz-Licón and also board member Rucker.

58:59.519 --> 59:24.851
The information as we as parents have been able to follow from the task force and the commissions do not appear to really clearly address, to be able to be clear that our students will be able to fully access a truly equitable educational

59:25.812 --> 59:34.781
system that will give them the career readiness that the traditional or A through G system will be.

59:35.101 --> 59:43.310
And right now, we're really trying to hear how this information will be really clear for families and to be engaged in.

59:51.448 --> 59:54.489
Good morning, Roberto Vera Montes with the Learning Policy Institute.

59:55.290 --> 59:59.491
We thank the State Board and CDE for the creation of the College and Career Indicator Workgroup.

01:00:00.112 --> 01:00:08.035
The workgroup will serve as the key anchor toward developing and enhancing a comprehensive system that measures college and career preparation among California's high schools.

01:00:09.155 --> 01:00:19.240
We look forward to engaging with staff and other stakeholders on the refinement of the College and Career Indicator, including the addition of more robust career indicators and the inclusion of the well-prepared category.

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:19.700
Thank you.

01:00:27.614 --> 01:00:29.074
Hi, my name is Diana Cruz.

01:00:29.115 --> 01:00:32.135
I'm a senior from Long Beach and a leader from California for Justice.

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:48.261
I started this about a year ago when students urged you to make school climate a priority and I shared my struggles as a former foster youth and my school climate was critical to not just keeping me in school but helping me achieve honor roll every year since.

01:00:49.261 --> 01:01:02.808
And although I'm proud of the progress we've made together to help make LCFF help all students, more needs to be done, specifically with school climate surveys because they're about two things our state says that they value, equity and student voice.

01:01:03.668 --> 01:01:10.952
A healthy and positive climate is the foundation to achieving equity in our education system and tools like climate surveys allow students and others to have a voice.

01:01:11.972 --> 01:01:19.281
I'm here to ask the State Board to dedicate more time to discuss and support school climate surveys to ensure they are a robust and powerful tool for continuous improvement.

01:01:20.162 --> 01:01:24.248
Keep your promise to students to make school climate a priority in California.

01:01:32.438 --> 01:01:38.344
Hello, my name is Hector Castaneda and I'm a recent San Jose graduate and a leader with Californians for Justice.

01:01:38.884 --> 01:01:44.710
Ever since you included suspensions and chronic absenteeism in the dashboard, we're seeing real impacts in our schools.

01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:51.296
Our district created new LCAP goals to align with the five state indicators to prioritize school climate and engagement.

01:01:51.856 --> 01:01:59.599
In the goal to decrease suspensions, it states that they want to establish and sustain healthy school cultures through relationship-centered practices.

01:02:00.119 --> 01:02:06.661
In our LCAP meetings, district staff are now saying that improving school climate is key to decreasing suspensions.

01:02:07.241 --> 01:02:11.883
This was possible because you listened to us, and there's still a lot more that needs to be done.

01:02:12.463 --> 01:02:18.285
We know showing up to school is not enough for us to achieve as students, so I ask you all, is this the best that we can do?

01:02:19.185 --> 01:02:26.751
If the State Board gives more attention and support on school climate surveys, more will be possible to make all schools relationship-centered schools.

01:02:27.451 --> 01:02:31.594
Keep your promise to students to value their voices and make school climate a priority.

01:02:31.835 --> 01:02:32.175
Thank you.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:50.381
Hello State Board of Education.

01:02:50.621 --> 01:02:56.664
My name is Zakiya Armstrong and I'm a recent graduate of Oakland High School and a leader with Californians for Justice.

01:02:57.325 --> 01:03:03.568
Throughout my time in high school I had the privilege of having teachers who really cared about me and the well-being of my classmates.

01:03:04.248 --> 01:03:08.911
My teachers will have one-on-one time and with each and every one of us inside and outside of class.

01:03:09.651 --> 01:03:17.718
And if any student was really struggling, they make sure to adjust their teaching and give that special attention and even engage our families for support.

01:03:18.499 --> 01:03:24.284
Just this year, I was struggling with my senior project, which determines whether I graduate or not.

01:03:24.905 --> 01:03:31.531
I was having major anxiety about the SJ portion and started to think I was going to fail and wanted to give up.

01:03:32.506 --> 01:03:37.850
But my teacher, Mr. Tucker, saw me in distress with one conversation, helped me become calmed and focused.

01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:40.812
Thanks to him, I was able to pass my project and graduate.

01:03:41.412 --> 01:03:45.995
I was fortunate to have a connection with an adult and knew they weren't going to give up on me.

01:03:46.996 --> 01:03:51.139
However, this wasn't the case at Oakland High School four years ago.

01:03:52.680 --> 01:04:01.306
In 2013, about 50% of students didn't feel safe at Oakland High School, and 77% of African American students were being suspended.

01:04:02.466 --> 01:04:14.332
But my school transformed because of four years ago, school leadership and staff prioritized collecting, studying school climate and engagement data, especially those of African-American students.

01:04:15.133 --> 01:04:23.057
When my school looks at student achievement, they look at suspensions and chronic absenteeism rates for African-American and Latino students.

01:04:23.697 --> 01:04:24.598
And they don't stop there.

01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:30.081
One of the biggest indicators is how students answer the California Healthy Kids Survey question.

01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:36.536
At my school, there is a teacher or some other adult who really cares about me.

01:04:37.237 --> 01:04:49.472
Because of school climate survey data, for the next three years, Oakland High is increasing the number of meaningful relationships with students by training all teachers in restorative justice.

01:04:50.515 --> 01:04:57.897
Because of this aggregated school climate survey data African-American students like me are getting the attention and support we need to succeed.

01:04:58.457 --> 01:05:00.397
I want this for all schools in California.

01:05:00.758 --> 01:05:02.638
And I'm here to ask you to make that happen.

01:05:05.019 --> 01:05:07.199
Having this data made a difference in my education.

01:05:07.979 --> 01:05:11.360
This can't and won't happen without more attention from the state board.

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:15.741
Let's not miss this opportunity to value students voices and advance equity.

01:05:15.761 --> 01:05:17.402
I mean equity.

01:05:18.042 --> 01:05:18.882
We are counting on you.

01:05:24.898 --> 01:05:37.667
I'd like to call the next group of speakers, please, who weren't previously called, Jason Henderson, Giselle Favaros, Angelita Ramos, Eric Premack, Ernie Silva, and the two groups of speakers from Pico, California.

01:05:39.619 --> 01:05:42.861
Hello, my name is Jordy May Corpus and I'm a staff with Californians for Justice.

01:05:43.542 --> 01:05:47.284
As you heard from our students, prioritizing school climate has already had a positive impact.

01:05:47.945 --> 01:05:50.266
But like Hector said, this is not the best we can do.

01:05:50.786 --> 01:05:56.931
School climate surveys directly capture the voices of students and can be robust tools for continuous improvement if the state does more.

01:05:57.651 --> 01:06:19.421
This is why we urge you to support the School Conditions and Climate Work Group's recommendations, especially administering an annual survey to have yearly comparisons and timely data, disaggregation of data by student subgroups to ensure equity, school-level survey results so they can be used in planning and decision-making processes, and survey constructs of safety, connectedness, and school conditions to ensure alignment with LCAP priorities and metrics.

01:06:20.141 --> 01:06:23.525
Also, we urge more support and resources for implementation.

01:06:23.545 --> 01:06:29.031
It's critical that you all play a stronger leadership role to ensure high reporting of data by districts.

01:06:29.512 --> 01:06:31.574
Ways the board can do that are addressed in our letter.

01:06:32.134 --> 01:06:36.559
And we believe these recommendations will fulfill your promise to make school climate a priority in California.

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:39.282
So let's continue to lead together to improve student success.

01:06:39.623 --> 01:06:39.883
Thank you.

01:06:51.516 --> 01:06:55.720
Good morning, Martha Alvarez on behalf of AXA, the Association of California School Administrators.

01:06:56.401 --> 01:07:00.705
I'll be brief since I have a supporting tenant who will be speaking for us with more comments.

01:07:01.405 --> 01:07:08.672
But on behalf of AXA, we are pleased to support the staff recommendation on the alternative schools eligibility criteria.

01:07:09.072 --> 01:07:12.455
We commend the different working groups providing feedback on these measures.

01:07:13.096 --> 01:07:17.020
We think it's very robust, so we'd like to support that recommendation.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:24.004
On the dashboard, we concur with the CDE staff's suggestion to hold off on any major changes to the dashboard until fall of 2018.

01:07:24.104 --> 01:07:29.307
We saw with the LCAP, we had three different LCAP templates approved by this board.

01:07:29.827 --> 01:07:32.288
It caused a lot of confusion at the local level.

01:07:32.689 --> 01:07:39.272
It required a lot of training for administrators, so we encourage the CDE and board to continue on that path of making major changes until fall of 2018.

01:07:40.573 --> 01:07:49.542
And lastly, on the college and career indicator, we concur with the board comments regarding the importance of ensuring it's a robust metric, a robust composite.

01:07:50.182 --> 01:07:57.889
We look forward to reviewing the CCI working group recommendations, specifically the three-year plan, and we look forward to being part of this work.

01:07:58.090 --> 01:07:58.370
Thank you.

01:08:04.963 --> 01:08:05.743
Good morning, board members.

01:08:05.944 --> 01:08:07.244
My name is Ralph Gomez-Porras.

01:08:07.364 --> 01:08:09.866
I'm the superintendent for Pacific Grove Unified School District.

01:08:10.406 --> 01:08:15.229
AXA's state president, past, and 26-year veteran bilingual educator.

01:08:15.789 --> 01:08:23.754
I currently serve as the association's accountability task force chair, and I am pleased to be here on behalf of that task force serving more than 18,000 administrators from across the state.

01:08:24.474 --> 01:08:35.944
We extend our deep appreciation to the State Board and the CDE staff for your continued efforts and commitment to improve the first phase of the new accountability system and thinking how we make this a successful system to support students in need.

01:08:36.424 --> 01:08:41.028
We are indeed grateful for the many opportunities afforded to the administrators and other stakeholders to provide input.

01:08:42.073 --> 01:08:51.723
During my time as the AXA president, I toured the state to meet with dozens of schools and district leaders and learn more about their local initiatives centered on equity and the goal of closing the achievement gaps.

01:08:52.243 --> 01:09:00.051
Administrators firmly believe the support and opportunities presented by the multiple measures system and continue to support that in the service of the whole child.

01:09:00.552 --> 01:09:05.016
We understand this is an evolving system and the state board is committed to making improvements over time.

01:09:05.757 --> 01:09:17.584
Because September of each year will be an important time when the State Board will consider making updates to the accountability system and the dashboard, we urge you and the CDE to consider how each of the proposed changes interact with the other parts of the accountability system.

01:09:18.124 --> 01:09:25.548
It is critically important that you take a comprehensive view on all of the changes that are being proposed and ultimately pursued instead of adopting them in isolation.

01:09:26.108 --> 01:09:30.691
Without regard for the increased workload, it may result on individual districts and school sites.

01:09:31.171 --> 01:09:34.173
ACSA continues to support a single coherent accountability system.

01:09:34.833 --> 01:09:41.815
Regarding the California dashboard, overall, there's been a very positive feedback from the field with our initial interaction with the dashboard.

01:09:42.176 --> 01:10:00.002
In my own experience in Monterey, using the data as part of this year's LCAP stakeholder engagement process, my district took the opportunity to educate parents and most importantly, students and other stakeholders about the key components of the dashboard, such as what the color coding mean and how the student groups that need additional supports and attention are evaluated.

01:10:00.462 --> 01:10:05.811
Most importantly, of course, is how the system will be used to improve instruction to meet the needs of our most needy students.

01:10:06.593 --> 01:10:13.444
While there are improvements that can be made to the dashboard, we support the proposed approach to focus modifications for the dashboard on functionality issues.

01:10:14.488 --> 01:10:27.499
Regarding school conditions and climate, we strongly support the inclusion of school climate measures as local indicators informing the accountability system because we understand the tremendous value in ensuring students, parents, and staff feel welcome in a safe school environment.

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:35.486
In particular, Monterey County, we're working on cybersecurity and measures to counter cyberbullying and its insidious contribution to depression and suicide.

01:10:35.887 --> 01:10:38.109
These indicators will give us the information we need.

01:10:38.769 --> 01:10:47.691
As was articulated in AX's comment letter, we'd like to share preliminary concerns of administrators across the state regarding the school conditions and climate work group draft recommendations.

01:10:48.231 --> 01:10:53.232
We believe the administration of annual surveys will come at a cost to conduct the surveys and other resources needed.

01:10:53.712 --> 01:11:03.174
As part of the feedback we have collected from administrators, the consensus that the survey needs to remain a requirement for alternate years and that the use of a qualitative tool should be used locally to get input.

01:11:05.114 --> 01:11:11.705
And by using alternate years, we'll allow time for progress programs and policies and practices in place to see positive progress.

01:11:12.006 --> 01:11:13.007
Thank you very much for your time.

01:11:13.027 --> 01:11:15.011
AXA stands in support of the State Board of Education.

01:11:22.453 --> 01:11:28.359
Good morning, President Kerr, Superintendent Torlakson, members of the board, LeAngela Reed on behalf of the Small School Districts Association.

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:41.012
I just want to take a moment to kind of to thank SBE and CDE staff for the tremendous outreach to Smalls and the request for feedback relative to end size and suspension rates and the conversations that are going.

01:11:41.793 --> 01:11:44.676
Our members feel very much a part of the process.

01:11:45.157 --> 01:11:53.346
They feel that they are making a contribution and that they own this new accountability system because of the outreach that's occurring.

01:11:53.886 --> 01:11:56.549
And it doesn't always happen.

01:11:57.390 --> 01:12:03.614
We often talk about equity areas, but we don't often talk about equity relative to school districts or rural and so forth.

01:12:03.674 --> 01:12:05.775
And so to have that conversation is tremendous.

01:12:06.575 --> 01:12:08.456
And it helps us to move this dashboard forward.

01:12:08.977 --> 01:12:14.460
And to that point, I just ask you, you know, we like in our accountability system to sort of finishing a house.

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:18.282
We're now down to the drapes and the carpet and the furniture.

01:12:18.322 --> 01:12:22.324
And those are things that are the least important in some ways and the most important in others.

01:12:22.364 --> 01:12:23.585
And that always take the longest.

01:12:24.545 --> 01:12:27.668
But we have to continue to move forward and finish the house.

01:12:27.868 --> 01:12:28.208
Thank you.

01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:33.592
Good morning, Samantha Tran with Children Now.

01:12:34.212 --> 01:12:38.975
I wanted to build on the comment that board member Ortiz-Lacon made regarding alternative ed.

01:12:39.295 --> 01:12:48.782
We really appreciate the work that's being done to think about different indicators that are more appropriate in that setting, especially given the highly mobile nature of those students.

01:12:49.722 --> 01:13:05.890
The one piece that we again lift up for the board's consideration that's aligned with current law and also recommendations by the LAO and PPIC is to think about how alternative education students are reflected in the dashboard related to LEAs, school districts, and county offices.

01:13:06.570 --> 01:13:12.633
The schools themselves are unique and we need to be thoughtful about those indicators, but the overall

01:13:13.653 --> 01:13:21.477
you know, indicators as it relates to graduation rate, assessment scores, chronic absenteeism, suspension, they're still part of the district.

01:13:21.557 --> 01:13:27.319
And so right now they're invisible in the system because we've not only taken them out of the school system, but we've taken them out of the LEAs.

01:13:27.419 --> 01:13:34.243
So having that policy conversation we think is really important and we hope the board will bring that to the table soon so that we can have that discussion.

01:13:34.383 --> 01:13:34.883
Thank you so much.

01:13:39.895 --> 01:13:41.316
Good morning, Sarah Lillis with EdVoice.

01:13:41.356 --> 01:13:42.976
I first want to align myself with Ms.

01:13:43.016 --> 01:13:47.518
Tran's comments about making sure that students in alternative schools are reflected in LEAs.

01:13:48.058 --> 01:13:51.080
But beyond that, we're very eager for the September board meeting.

01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:59.243
We recognize how important this first rollout is of actually implementing and utilizing the dashboard in local and state accountability.

01:13:59.603 --> 01:14:02.785
To that point, we're concerned about things that are being deferred.

01:14:03.125 --> 01:14:07.006
I understand stability is important to LEAs.

01:14:07.347 --> 01:14:08.007
At the same time,

01:14:08.667 --> 01:14:18.690
board members and stakeholders have raised issues for the last several years that have not been addressed that are fundamental to this accountability system reflecting the goals of LCFF and a unified accountability system.

01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:38.096
So we would urge if it's about the equity report reflecting what we wanted to reflect or capturing interim and long-term goals in the dashboard itself, if it's not to be addressed in September in this first round, at the very least, we would encourage the board to direct staff to integrate a plan, a concrete plan for when those things will be reflected in the accountability system

01:14:39.278 --> 01:14:40.581
and build it into the timeline.

01:14:40.621 --> 01:14:43.447
So we would urge you to address some of those key issues now and not wait.

01:14:43.467 --> 01:14:44.109
Thanks.

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:50.491
Hi, Brian Lee on behalf of Fight Crime Invest in Kids, Ready Nation, and Mission Readiness.

01:14:51.192 --> 01:15:01.859
In this agenda item on updating the dashboard and continuing development of the rubrics, I worry that we're missing a robust discussion on data that's buried into item three, and it's how is the dashboard doing?

01:15:02.219 --> 01:15:11.645
As you probably saw on there, of 181 districts identified through our LCFF system, two-thirds are just based on special need populations alone, just on disabled students.

01:15:12.686 --> 01:15:21.254
On the other hand, for the LCFF targeted students, which is low-income students and English learners, at most 37 districts are targeted.

01:15:22.035 --> 01:15:22.776
Is that working?

01:15:22.816 --> 01:15:24.798
Is that getting at the goals that we really want?

01:15:25.158 --> 01:15:29.803
And I also put to you, is this a problem with LCFF or is it an issue that the board can reckon with?

01:15:30.303 --> 01:15:34.727
Certainly, LCFF put forward a framework for identifying schools in need.

01:15:35.088 --> 01:15:37.810
However, the board has made two important decisions.

01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:43.775
They've decided that what's in the statute that says failure to improve across two priorities means two reds.

01:15:44.216 --> 01:15:46.057
And then it's decided what a red means.

01:15:46.598 --> 01:15:54.065
So as you look at that, I think we might want to consider reconsidering all of that so we make sure that we're really identifying the student schools we want to and districts we want to identify.

01:15:54.165 --> 01:15:54.445
Thank you.

01:15:59.349 --> 01:16:02.191
Good morning, Liz Guillen with Public Advocates.

01:16:03.251 --> 01:16:09.094
You should have the coalition, LCFF Equity Coalition letter in your electronic file.

01:16:10.375 --> 01:16:19.640
I would like to echo the observation by Member Burr that a lot, a lot of work has been happening.

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:29.324
and the level of transparency that we've seen around the kind of information we only dreamed of years ago, we're able to wrap our hands around, which is really great.

01:16:30.585 --> 01:16:38.969
I also, though, want to echo our CFJ student partners, and that is that we think we can do better, and we want to help us all do better.

01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:59.672
And in that vein, I want to point out that the indicator for the state priorities, state priority around broad course access is one that we hope you will put back on the radar as part of a longer term work plan, since we know we're not getting to it in September, which is disappointing.

01:17:01.414 --> 01:17:14.586
And we know that board members have spoken about the importance of identifying access to core courses like life science, social studies, art, music, PE.

01:17:15.427 --> 01:17:21.753
And we think this is very important as part of the planning that begins well before high school.

01:17:22.694 --> 01:17:23.094
Thank you.

01:17:27.267 --> 01:17:29.988
Good morning, Colin Miller with the California Charter Schools Association.

01:17:30.808 --> 01:17:35.108
We do want to just support moving forward on the ASAM criteria at this meeting.

01:17:35.148 --> 01:17:39.849
We know there's a time crunch in terms of getting those schools identified for the dashboard in the fall.

01:17:40.629 --> 01:17:46.891
But we do note that these are new criteria, particularly moving from one year to six months and the transiency data.

01:17:46.951 --> 01:17:54.092
And as Cindy noted, we just don't have the data to know, you know, which schools are going to be applying and eligible under this criteria.

01:17:54.492 --> 01:18:08.576
So we would request that you, as part of your action, have this come back to the board once you have that data to make sure that you've got it right, that you're not over-identifying schools or under-identifying schools that truly are intended to be alternative.

01:18:08.656 --> 01:18:10.696
So we would recommend that you do that.

01:18:11.336 --> 01:18:18.918
Also, as we move forward to looking at the criteria and the metrics, I would remind you that you do have a Charter School Advisory Commission.

01:18:18.958 --> 01:18:21.419
We do appreciate that there are charter school participants on the

01:18:22.319 --> 01:18:31.638
the ASAM committee, but we also urge you to use your own charter school advisor commission to vet some of these issues as they're moving forward, these big policy issues on charter schools.

01:18:31.678 --> 01:18:31.899
Thank you.

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:37.481
Hi, I'm Angela DeRamos.

01:18:37.661 --> 01:18:40.063
I'm here on behalf of California Teachers Association.

01:18:40.103 --> 01:18:41.244
I'm also a fifth grade teacher.

01:18:42.385 --> 01:18:48.650
The holistic multidimensional accountability system is a much needed change from the single number system of the previous years.

01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:56.275
Throughout the development of the rubric and dashboard, we have consistently raised concerns about local indicators being relegated to second tier status.

01:18:57.196 --> 01:19:02.900
We know recent reports are that very few local agencies have implemented local indicators.

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:07.563
In my own district, the push by admin is still very much on test scores.

01:19:08.263 --> 01:19:11.265
We are suspending API, but old habits die hard.

01:19:11.966 --> 01:19:18.170
We see resources already being allocated towards test prep on a test that's supposedly designed to avoid teaching to the test.

01:19:19.571 --> 01:19:25.356
The timeline in attachment five speaks to a communication phase for local indicators, but much more is needed.

01:19:25.756 --> 01:19:34.223
We urge the board to direct staff to develop options that would incentivize LEAs to implement the local indicators beyond the not met for two years provision.

01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:40.448
The holistic indicators need to be meaningfully implemented and prioritized to highlight and measure what actually matters.

01:19:40.908 --> 01:19:46.153
Student outcomes and the conditions of learning that form the foundation of an equitable educational opportunity.

01:19:46.593 --> 01:19:48.975
We look forward to seeing greater urgency

01:19:49.255 --> 01:19:50.075
in pursuit of this goal.

01:19:50.416 --> 01:19:50.716
Thank you.

01:19:56.018 --> 01:19:56.978
Good morning, board members.

01:19:57.018 --> 01:19:58.759
I'm Ernie Silva with Sciatech.

01:19:58.799 --> 01:20:02.020
We're, as you know by now, a network of dropout recovery high schools.

01:20:03.081 --> 01:20:10.323
I want to just publicly thank the board and the staff for including us in the task force that's doing really important work.

01:20:10.744 --> 01:20:15.245
And I want to respond to board member Ortiz-Lacombe's issues of

01:20:17.086 --> 01:20:19.787
the appropriateness of including alternative metrics.

01:20:20.227 --> 01:20:25.710
For us, we believe that equity demands that separate measures be included in the system.

01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:28.031
Otherwise, our students fall through the cracks.

01:20:28.451 --> 01:20:35.294
We also want to recognize the responsibility of schools and LEAs for serving the student population that we serve.

01:20:36.254 --> 01:20:51.048
And what our school has done in moving forward is we've adopted an A through G pathway for our very low-income former dropouts so that students have access not just to career development and community college, but to four-year universities as well.

01:20:51.369 --> 01:20:51.729
Thank you.

01:20:56.798 --> 01:21:02.499
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center, in very strong support of the revised exam criteria.

01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:07.641
These discussions we've been having with the department staff, and I thank them very deeply.

01:21:07.661 --> 01:21:10.781
They've met with us probably 20 times over the last five years.

01:21:11.662 --> 01:21:16.863
These concerns go way back before the dashboard, and they've been doing a lot of work on this.

01:21:16.983 --> 01:21:23.545
And we think the recommendations reflect a lot of thought beyond what they related to you today.

01:21:23.605 --> 01:21:24.965
So we support them very much.

01:21:26.206 --> 01:21:33.152
Like many of you, we continue to be concerned about kind of the data limitation tail wagging the CCI dog.

01:21:33.792 --> 01:21:51.087
And I've long believed that we should have a process whereby individual schools or districts can come forward with a proposed CCI definition, if you will, that would meet the standard that doesn't happen to fit into the standard state definitions box and would hope that you would consider that.

01:21:51.267 --> 01:21:51.527
Thank you.

01:21:53.806 --> 01:21:55.547
That concludes the public comments.

01:21:55.587 --> 01:22:01.330
So now we're ready for board member comments or a motion, whatever the board prefers.

01:22:01.810 --> 01:22:02.590
Board member Burr.

01:22:03.691 --> 01:22:08.113
Well, I'm prepared to make the motion to adopt the staff recommendation.

01:22:08.153 --> 01:22:11.935
But I do have, I want to make one clarifying question.

01:22:11.975 --> 01:22:18.778
I think it goes to this issue of one accountability system or and I would encourage our friends in who have pushed for this.

01:22:19.398 --> 01:22:25.362
to stop using the acronym ASAM because that was a separate accountability system.

01:22:25.482 --> 01:22:28.544
So just a friendly suggestion.

01:22:29.365 --> 01:22:38.631
But what we're talking about now really is how do you identify schools, schools that are serving these populations that really are very challenged populations.

01:22:38.671 --> 01:22:43.414
And we need to have metrics that reflect that, that was spoken eloquently.

01:22:43.914 --> 01:22:48.898
But what we haven't talked about, and I just want to clarify this, is sort of the so what question.

01:22:49.819 --> 01:23:03.860
When we identify the metrics and we say this is appropriate, you know, whether to your point, Member Holiday, it's a growth metric of how many additional credits have they gained or, you know, did they graduate within one year or whatever it happens to be.

01:23:04.901 --> 01:23:20.112
I assume that that data is also going to be reported just like everything else in the dashboard by subgroups and that the statute that says if you're not successful with your subgroups on those metrics that we determine, then there are consequences.

01:23:20.652 --> 01:23:22.433
There's additional technical assistance.

01:23:22.453 --> 01:23:24.255
There's potentially intervention.

01:23:24.995 --> 01:23:36.724
So I just wanted to ask that question because I think that's the piece we're kind of missing, that we will be treating them the same way for purposes of identifying schools that are in need of additional support.

01:23:37.385 --> 01:23:37.885
That's correct.

01:23:37.925 --> 01:23:40.507
And just a clarification on my point too, I think

01:23:42.248 --> 01:23:46.229
in that same regard, so they will have a graduation rate indicator.

01:23:46.249 --> 01:23:47.749
They will have a suspension rate indicator.

01:23:47.949 --> 01:23:51.390
There may be metrics that are different, for example, that you use for graduation rate.

01:23:51.410 --> 01:23:58.471
Maybe it's not a four-year, maybe it's a one-year, but that is the intent with the alternative schools indicator.

01:23:58.511 --> 01:24:02.972
The other piece I wanted to make sure that everybody was aware of is these schools will count towards the LEA as well.

01:24:03.232 --> 01:24:09.134
We are not going to keep them from rolling up to the LEA.

01:24:09.154 --> 01:24:11.254
The LEA will have consequences, as you mentioned,

01:24:11.834 --> 01:24:21.279
if they don't perform the student subgroups or the student groups that are identified under LCFF if they're not performing the same consequences as they would as a traditional school.

01:24:21.599 --> 01:24:22.279
Okay, thank you.

01:24:22.799 --> 01:24:27.642
So I will make the motion, but I think we still have... Yes, we have to reopen public comment.

01:24:27.662 --> 01:24:33.564
Some of our people that wanted to speak were in an overflow room and could not get into the main room.

01:24:33.625 --> 01:24:36.446
So we're now... Call the list, please.

01:24:40.217 --> 01:24:42.138
The speakers are from PICO, California.

01:24:44.499 --> 01:24:45.499
My name is Sena Flores.

01:24:45.579 --> 01:24:49.881
I'm a parent and organizer with our PICO affiliate here in Sacramento, Sacramento Act.

01:24:52.021 --> 01:24:53.002
Good morning, board members.

01:24:53.042 --> 01:24:54.322
My name is Maria Ruiz.

01:24:54.783 --> 01:24:57.243
I'm a parent leader from Los Angeles.

01:24:57.384 --> 01:24:58.284
I'm happy to be here.

01:24:58.304 --> 01:24:59.564
Thank you.

01:25:00.845 --> 01:25:01.225
Good morning.

01:25:01.265 --> 01:25:02.726
My name is Lisa Thornton.

01:25:02.766 --> 01:25:06.387
I'm an organizer with LA Voice, PICO Federation in Los Angeles.

01:25:08.021 --> 01:25:09.202
Good morning, board members.

01:25:09.222 --> 01:25:13.326
My name is Katie Nunez-Adler, and I'm with the PICO Federation in Oakland.

01:25:13.386 --> 01:25:15.128
I'm a parent and a community organizer.

01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:17.630
Hello, my name is Daniel.

01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:20.172
I'm a student in Merced City School.

01:25:22.435 --> 01:25:22.775
Good morning.

01:25:22.815 --> 01:25:26.138
My name is Andre Spearman, and I'm a parent, PICO, California, Oakland.

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:28.741
And good morning.

01:25:28.761 --> 01:25:29.782
My name is Sushong.

01:25:29.882 --> 01:25:31.283
I'm also a parent from Merced.

01:25:34.654 --> 01:25:39.519
Hi, my name is Carrie Rosado, Pico, California, San Jose, and a parent of Franklin McKinley School District.

01:25:42.982 --> 01:25:47.947
Patricia Hill, Pico, California, Franklin McKinley School District, San Jose, California.

01:25:50.610 --> 01:25:52.311
Good morning, my name is Frank Ponciano.

01:25:52.391 --> 01:25:55.955
I'm a community organizer in our Pico Federation in the great city of San Jose.

01:25:58.479 --> 01:26:03.064
Hi, my name is Maya Nunez-Adler and I am a student leader with Pico, California from Oakland.

01:26:04.006 --> 01:26:06.228
We are here today representing Pico, California.

01:26:06.729 --> 01:26:09.352
Pico, California has 19 federations across the state.

01:26:09.772 --> 01:26:18.423
We are a multi-faith, multi-racial organization that strives to develop local leadership in our congregations, schools, and communities to work for racial, social, and economic justice.

01:26:18.943 --> 01:26:29.452
Together, we represent over 480 interfaith congregations and 450,000 families of diverse economic, racial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds rooted in school districts across the state.

01:26:30.292 --> 01:26:37.338
In recent statewide elections, PICO California and our local federations have led some of California's largest volunteer voter engagement efforts.

01:26:37.878 --> 01:26:46.806
We talk to our communities to encourage them to vote their values and address issues ranging from ensuring quality education with the passage of Prop 30 and the recent extension of Prop 55,

01:26:48.507 --> 01:26:50.989
to promoting criminal justice reform with Prop 47 and 57.

01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:57.615
PICO California parents and students have made our voices heard with legislators, the governor, and here with you.

01:26:58.596 --> 01:27:02.779
We are also working every day with allies and educators in our school communities and local districts.

01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:09.225
We are deeply committed to and value these partnerships and the ongoing work to transform communities and outcomes for every student in California.

01:27:17.588 --> 01:27:17.848
Sorry.

01:27:19.108 --> 01:27:22.329
Today we're urging the State Board to support the following recommendations.

01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:29.451
One, administer the survey every year to help make faster decisions on the most relevant and timely data.

01:27:29.952 --> 01:27:38.514
Two, desegregate data by race, ethnicity, and other student subgroups to achieve equitable student outcomes.

01:27:38.954 --> 01:27:44.936
Three, allow for school-level survey results so they can be used in planning and decision-making processes.

01:27:45.636 --> 01:27:50.920
Four, require that surveys address safety, correctness, and school conditions at a minimum.

01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:55.843
Five, examine connections between LCFF students and special needs students.

01:27:58.505 --> 01:28:09.252
We are continuing to advocate for evidence-based practices and state-level indicators that will support comparability and continuous improvement around parent involvement in schools and districts across California.

01:28:10.053 --> 01:28:13.355
Some key practices and indicators that we're continuing to advocate for

01:28:13.955 --> 01:28:19.721
Measuring include cross-training with parents, educators, and students to support dual capacity building.

01:28:20.422 --> 01:28:24.727
Relationship building practices between parents and educators to better collaborate.

01:28:25.147 --> 01:28:36.079
School and districts have systems and structures in place to provide parents, caregivers, with the interpretation and translation services they need to be full partners and participants.

01:28:36.739 --> 01:28:43.986
and the use of parent surveys as a tool to understand experience and efficacy of trainings and programs.

01:28:54.986 --> 01:28:58.847
I'm here today because I want to say an important message about LCFF.

01:28:59.287 --> 01:29:04.789
As a parent, there has to be more basic language and more understandable language for the community.

01:29:05.349 --> 01:29:13.651
By doing this, will we see more strong community, more teamwork, and everything will be more clearly meaning about the LCFF.

01:29:14.791 --> 01:29:24.254
Um, y digo esto porque tuve una mala experiencia con mi principal en la cual fue, en la cual fue mi primera vez que atendía mis cafecitos.

01:29:25.075 --> 01:29:38.379
Um, tuve una mala experiencia, no fue muy bienvenida, y esto me hizo más carácter fuerte para cambiar todos esos aspectos porque no fue una buena bienvenida.

01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:42.701
Um, y lo que he hecho, eh,

01:29:45.742 --> 01:29:46.403
I had a bad experience.

01:29:46.423 --> 01:29:47.924
And LCFF was the first time that I attended.

01:29:48.004 --> 01:29:48.945
Oh, you're translating?

01:29:49.345 --> 01:29:49.785
Oh, OK.

01:29:49.805 --> 01:29:50.146
I'm sorry.

01:29:50.166 --> 01:29:50.346
Oh, OK.

01:30:14.847 --> 01:30:17.229
to inform myself about my school.

01:30:17.249 --> 01:30:19.111
To my surprise, I didn't have a good welcoming.

01:30:19.251 --> 01:30:20.472
For this, I tried to talk to other parents

01:30:37.786 --> 01:30:45.451
And I involved myself in the district to change this culture of bad communication.

01:30:46.312 --> 01:30:50.075
LCFF is a good tool, but it needs to be better for us as parents.

01:30:50.095 --> 01:30:50.295
Thank you.

01:31:03.479 --> 01:31:06.580
So again, my name is Zia Xiong, I'm a parent of Merced.

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:14.763
I'm a Hmong parent, and Merced has the third largest Hmong population of students in State California.

01:31:15.404 --> 01:31:21.406
I just wanted to know that I brought my son today so he could see firsthand how education really impact him.

01:31:22.106 --> 01:31:28.869
And as a parent advocate, I work with several school district in Merced, both with the superintendent, LCAP directors,

01:31:29.810 --> 01:31:39.039
Several years ago, every time I go to LCAP meeting, there's only about two or three parents, and I was very concerned and was really disturbed by that.

01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:50.010
By working with the superintendents and working with the community, we're able to change some of the culture, just meeting at the school district, to a community center, to Boys and Girls Club,

01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:56.195
to at local schools where parents could be accessed to the information.

01:31:56.675 --> 01:32:02.520
Also making sure that Hmong language and Spanish language are also interpreted during the LCAP meetings.

01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:05.502
So with that, I think we make a lot of progress.

01:32:05.903 --> 01:32:08.145
I believe in LCAP, that it's inclusive.

01:32:08.665 --> 01:32:12.908
And growing up in America as a refugee, I didn't have the opportunity.

01:32:12.928 --> 01:32:14.510
Now my son has the opportunity.

01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:20.455
So I just want to make sure that the board and Superintendent, all of you support the continuations of LCAP.

01:32:20.495 --> 01:32:23.197
And I'm going to lift this up at my local board as well.

01:32:23.217 --> 01:32:24.298
So I appreciate your hard work.

01:32:24.458 --> 01:32:24.718
Thank you.

01:32:28.436 --> 01:32:33.961
And in closing, it is important for us to continue to advocate and be strong on LCFL.

01:32:34.541 --> 01:32:38.225
We continue to advocate for equitable and holistic accountability systems.

01:32:38.825 --> 01:32:44.190
We believe that powerful relationships between all stakeholders are essential to academic success.

01:32:44.951 --> 01:32:49.174
Positive school climate and culture creates the conditions for academic success.

01:32:50.035 --> 01:33:09.197
The involvement engagement of parents and caregivers as well as students in partnership with educators is essential to ensuring that we improve opportunities and outcomes for all students and especially low-income students, black and brown students, foster and immigrant students across our state in order to make the promise of LCFF a reality.

01:33:09.318 --> 01:33:09.638
Thank you.

01:33:14.548 --> 01:33:14.748
Okay.

01:33:14.848 --> 01:33:16.409
Member Burr, maybe you can resume.

01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:29.798
I would like to move the CDE recommendation that's shown on the screen here and printed in our agenda to suspend the academic performance index and adopt the eligibility criteria for alternative status.

01:33:30.378 --> 01:33:30.739
Second.

01:33:30.759 --> 01:33:32.620
Okay.

01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:35.722
Any further board discussion on the motion and the second?

01:33:37.401 --> 01:33:39.422
Hearing none, all those in favor, raise your hands.

01:33:39.442 --> 01:33:42.023
Okay, it carries unanimously.

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:42.623
Thank you.

01:33:42.643 --> 01:33:45.484
The board will then recess till 10.15.

01:33:45.524 --> 01:33:53.007
The board will reconvene.

01:34:01.067 --> 01:34:02.208
Thank you, President Kirst.

01:34:02.849 --> 01:34:11.174
Yeah, I wanted to make some opening remarks, so I'll do that, and then you stay right there.

01:34:11.214 --> 01:34:12.214
They're going to be very brief.

01:34:13.035 --> 01:34:19.639
In this item, we will hear a presentation from the CDE staff on developing an integrated statewide system of support.

01:34:20.399 --> 01:34:23.101
that incorporates all state and federal programs.

01:34:24.922 --> 01:34:35.568
This work will focus on the how of delivering support for local educational agencies and schools that is tailored to their locally defined needs.

01:34:36.248 --> 01:35:01.606
And finally, and the presentation seeks feedback from SBE and others on a proposed regional structure for coordinating supports and increasing access to and consistency of supports under the state and building support and capacity for counties of Office of Education and undergirding the critical role of LCFF.

01:35:01.646 --> 01:35:03.447
So without further ado,

01:35:05.208 --> 01:35:09.270
We're going to have several presenters here, and Karek Ashley will lead off.

01:35:09.850 --> 01:35:10.811
Thank you, President Kirst.

01:35:10.871 --> 01:35:15.053
Karek Ashley, Deputy Superintendent, Performance Planning and Technology Branch.

01:35:15.553 --> 01:35:21.596
I'm here to actually introduce the main presenter for this item, Melanie Sheppy.

01:35:22.656 --> 01:35:26.058
I hired her about a year ago to be my administrative

01:35:27.123 --> 01:35:52.648
branch administrator for our branch, and she came to us from Oakland Unified as a former teacher, former school principal, and then for the last three months from that position, she was promoted to Director of the Improvement and Accountability Division, which, along with Stephanie Gregson, is leading some work here on the system of support.

01:35:53.308 --> 01:35:58.531
So, I wanted to take this opportunity, this is the first time Melanie has presented to you as a State Board.

01:35:59.391 --> 01:36:04.274
I have hired behind Melanie, sitting here, Shanine Coates.

01:36:04.614 --> 01:36:05.955
You'll be seeing more of her as well.

01:36:05.995 --> 01:36:11.098
She is now the Branch Administrator for the Performance Planning and Technology Branch.

01:36:11.418 --> 01:36:13.699
So, without further ado, Melanie Sheppy.

01:36:17.233 --> 01:36:20.954
Good morning, Board President Kerr, Superintendent Torlakson, and fellow board members.

01:36:21.914 --> 01:36:25.294
As Deputy Superintendent Carrick-Ashley mentioned, my name is Melanie Sheppey.

01:36:25.875 --> 01:36:30.515
I'm the Director of the Improvement and Accountability Division at the California Department of Education.

01:36:30.935 --> 01:36:39.177
Today, I'm presenting Item 2, Developing an Integrated Statewide System of Support for Local Educational Agencies and Schools.

01:36:39.877 --> 01:36:44.498
I am seeking feedback, no action unless, of course, you deem it necessary and appropriate.

01:36:46.977 --> 01:36:51.121
Carrick also mentioned that I was formerly a teacher and principal in Oakland Unified.

01:36:51.681 --> 01:36:56.605
For my first presentation to you, I really wanted to include a picture of my Greenleaf scholars.

01:36:57.446 --> 01:37:00.529
However, I had to play it safe and include a stock photo of kids.

01:37:04.582 --> 01:37:09.626
But I promise, if you have me back, I will slip in some photos of my Greenleaf scholars.

01:37:10.306 --> 01:37:13.649
At Greenleaf, almost 100% of our students were from low-income backgrounds.

01:37:14.189 --> 01:37:20.234
We were selected to expand from a K-5 to a TK-8 after demonstrating significant success.

01:37:21.206 --> 01:37:23.528
We were then selected to become a dual immersion school.

01:37:24.368 --> 01:37:38.639
I share this because examples of schools and districts that find sustainable improvement so that each of their students can have an excellent education is what drives my work with creating an integrated system of support.

01:37:40.555 --> 01:37:44.977
For my presentation today, I'll first review background from the June memo.

01:37:45.498 --> 01:37:48.099
That's entitled Developing an Integrated System of Support.

01:37:48.919 --> 01:37:53.682
The background will include the goal and characteristics of an integrated system of support.

01:37:54.542 --> 01:38:00.425
Then I'll review emerging feedback and a proposed regional structure, as President Kirste mentioned in his opening remarks.

01:38:01.226 --> 01:38:05.348
I'll end our time with discussion questions and of course try to answer any questions you have.

01:38:06.482 --> 01:38:14.811
For our board discussion, we'll focus not only on the proposed regional structure, but also the goals and characteristics put forward in the June memo.

01:38:16.243 --> 01:38:19.224
The June memo begins with an overview of the system support framework.

01:38:19.944 --> 01:38:22.305
Within that framework, there are three levels of support.

01:38:22.885 --> 01:38:25.346
Level one includes support for all districts and schools.

01:38:25.766 --> 01:38:27.727
Level two is differentiated support.

01:38:28.227 --> 01:38:31.808
And level three is intensive support with differentiation between those levels.

01:38:31.908 --> 01:38:35.469
You'll notice that's also information that was brought forward in August of 2016.

01:38:36.370 --> 01:38:40.411
So not entirely new, but definitely a framework for the system of support moving forward.

01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:46.502
Beyond the framework, the system of support must be rooted in the key LCFF policy decisions.

01:38:46.902 --> 01:38:50.884
Those include, as you know, that we need to use multiple measures of student success.

01:38:51.404 --> 01:38:57.926
You heard today student speakers talking about how you can use multiple measures to think about growth and continuous improvement for school communities.

01:38:59.007 --> 01:39:09.731
Resource decisions must be linked to identified needs and there needs to be a focus on districts or local educational agencies for local accountability and supporting change within schools.

01:39:11.943 --> 01:39:23.188
The system of support's goal is to help LEAs and schools improve their ability to meet the needs of each student and focus on equity in building local capacity to sustain improvement.

01:39:24.309 --> 01:39:28.671
To reach that goal, the June memo outlined several characteristics of the system of support.

01:39:30.148 --> 01:39:43.937
The system of support needs to reduce redundancy across state and federal programs, integrate guidance and resources across state and federal programs, and assistance must also support LEAs to meet identified needs through the LCAP process.

01:39:47.259 --> 01:39:53.563
The June memo also put forward key questions for the State Board of Education and local educators and stakeholders to consider.

01:39:54.704 --> 01:39:59.387
After hearing your feedback today, we'll continue to engage with local educators and stakeholders.

01:40:00.655 --> 01:40:01.776
around these key questions.

01:40:02.657 --> 01:40:09.503
For the board discussion at the end of my presentation, I pulled out question number two and question number three for us to focus on.

01:40:09.743 --> 01:40:17.350
You'll also notice that you have a handout with these six questions, plus an additional one I added to get feedback about the proposed regional structure.

01:40:19.952 --> 01:40:27.439
Even though I highlighted question two and three for our discussion today, I more than welcome any feedback on any of the other questions or other parts of the June memo.

01:40:31.544 --> 01:40:36.925
There have been emerging themes that have developed from initial stakeholder feedback on the key questions we just referenced.

01:40:37.886 --> 01:40:44.247
Initial feedback opportunities to discuss those questions include the June CPAG meeting, where members discussed part of the June memo.

01:40:45.288 --> 01:40:48.588
Also, comments on the system of support from the ESSA stakeholder sessions.

01:40:48.648 --> 01:40:50.849
I was honored to be part of those in different phases.

01:40:51.429 --> 01:40:56.270
And you could tell throughout those sessions, people were giving suggestions and ideas for the system of support.

01:40:56.451 --> 01:40:57.471
Tried to pull those out as well.

01:40:58.451 --> 01:41:11.377
meetings with the LCFF Policy Stakeholder Group, an internal work group my School Improvement Team created with West End, and of course, the first quarterly meeting between California Department of Education, State Board of Education, SSESA, and CCEE.

01:41:12.417 --> 01:41:18.640
For more details on key themes from that specific first quarterly meeting, you can look at page four of the July item.

01:41:18.900 --> 01:41:25.923
It was a great meeting to be a part of, and I'm glad that we're able to have the meeting after we've had the first quarterly meeting, or have this board meeting after that first quarterly meeting.

01:41:27.256 --> 01:41:29.977
Now to address the bullets on the screen about some of the emerging trends.

01:41:30.858 --> 01:41:34.540
The first prominent piece of feedback is something that we know doesn't work.

01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:36.721
And we've begun to call this the wrong door theory.

01:41:37.561 --> 01:41:48.286
This is the experience that an educator or leader can have when you're seeking specific feedback, and every door you knock on opens only to say, oh, I'm sorry, not here.

01:41:48.306 --> 01:41:50.027
I can't help with that problem.

01:41:52.085 --> 01:41:57.507
We know that our system support can't have this be part of its culture.

01:41:58.827 --> 01:42:07.710
We know another theme that the board has made clear in previous meetings is that local educators and stakeholders need to define assistance.

01:42:09.491 --> 01:42:16.533
Additionally, CPAG and others have expressed a strong desire for the system of support to focus on root cause analysis and building capacity.

01:42:17.734 --> 01:42:20.915
A final early theme is that support must be coordinated.

01:42:24.434 --> 01:42:37.661
So the July item builds upon the proposed goal and characteristics outlined in the June memo, and additionally puts forward a structure for a system of support.

01:42:39.082 --> 01:42:44.444
The proposed regional structure is one single structure for supporting LEAs under all state and federal programs.

01:42:45.165 --> 01:42:50.968
It would include regional leads, which would be critical to coordinating supports provided to LEAs and schools.

01:42:52.142 --> 01:42:55.023
This is different than the support we created under No Child Left Behind.

01:42:55.603 --> 01:43:01.746
Under No Child Left Behind, we created several different regional systems that provided support without a formal mechanism for coordination.

01:43:04.968 --> 01:43:12.491
Under the proposed regional structure, one or more county offices of education would apply through a competitive process to be a regional lead.

01:43:13.511 --> 01:43:19.154
Also mentioned in the July item, CCEE and CDE would have a formal role to build capacity and align resources.

01:43:20.225 --> 01:43:26.548
I want to reiterate again, the structure is intended to coordinate and align resources.

01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:29.310
It does not attempt to define assistance.

01:43:29.490 --> 01:43:33.212
Again, to what President Kirsch said in the beginning, talking about the how, not necessarily the what.

01:43:34.132 --> 01:43:40.556
In reading through the letters for today's meeting from stakeholders, they picked up on the intent that the regional structure is also about the how.

01:43:41.176 --> 01:43:46.739
And they, of course, expressed urgency and a desire to talk about the how, but also to talk about the what.

01:43:48.508 --> 01:43:55.492
Two more points I want to make before pausing for board discussion is that the proposed regional structure is not about starting from scratch.

01:43:56.092 --> 01:44:06.737
You'll notice in the June memo and the July item, different examples of local resources and structures that are already in place need to be integrated into one system of support.

01:44:07.138 --> 01:44:09.098
We don't need to start from scratch on everything.

01:44:09.118 --> 01:44:13.561
There are good things that are happening out there that have bubbled up from local needs and resources.

01:44:14.679 --> 01:44:18.380
And also that the proposed regional structure is about building county office capacity.

01:44:19.181 --> 01:44:22.642
In initial conversation I had with stakeholders, they said, so is this something separate?

01:44:23.182 --> 01:44:29.324
And that made me realize that as we continue to talk about the system of support, it has to be very clear how everything is connected.

01:44:29.785 --> 01:44:36.907
And that might mean visuals or other ways to display intersegmented partnerships, but it's not about creating something separate.

01:44:37.067 --> 01:44:41.469
So hopefully your feedback will also help us continue to design something that reflects that.

01:44:43.424 --> 01:44:46.886
The June memo also discussed how the system of support needs metrics of success.

01:44:47.646 --> 01:44:52.929
These metrics will assist us in improving the system over time and ensure that the system is meeting local needs.

01:44:55.370 --> 01:45:04.955
For our discussion today, you'll see on the screen that I pulled out question two and three from the questions that we developed that we want to get more feedback from local educators and stakeholders.

01:45:06.396 --> 01:45:12.499
I also added a question about how can we have the proposed regional structure be designed to support one integrated system.

01:45:14.710 --> 01:45:19.257
With that, I would love to hear your feedback and answer any questions if you have them.

01:45:20.038 --> 01:45:20.319
Thank you.

01:45:26.679 --> 01:45:34.562
all regional structures or one regional structure or, I mean, you can't, you know, this is a huge topic when you start talking.

01:45:35.343 --> 01:45:37.824
And so it's not just county offices of education.

01:45:38.344 --> 01:45:40.225
So what are you asking feedback on?

01:45:40.265 --> 01:45:48.128
The entire concept of a regional structure or a particular provider, the counties, which are just one of many providers?

01:45:48.797 --> 01:45:59.244
So I would like feedback also on the goals and characteristics of the system of support, but also more specifically on page five of the item, it talks about proposed integrated system of support.

01:46:00.264 --> 01:46:04.027
And in there, it talks about the roles of county offices of education, CDE and CCEE.

01:46:05.868 --> 01:46:11.312
And it talks about under a regional structure, one or more county offices could apply through a competitive process.

01:46:11.693 --> 01:46:22.842
And that regional lead would help coordinate the existing structures of support and identify where there are needs of support for local educators and stakeholders.

01:46:25.689 --> 01:46:29.473
Right now, we have, like you said, several different types of support going out there.

01:46:29.593 --> 01:46:35.539
And this is the idea of, let's formalize a regional structure that would coordinate those different pieces of support.

01:46:37.045 --> 01:46:42.207
I don't know how many county offices would apply to be regional leads or what the right number is of regional leads.

01:46:42.267 --> 01:46:48.449
If you all have feedback on that today or even direction of what type of feedback you want us to gather so you can have an opinion on that.

01:46:49.770 --> 01:46:58.533
But really it's very high level and hoping that your feedback will then give our team more guidance to operationalize it and bring you back more detail.

01:46:59.352 --> 01:47:05.234
And these would include non-government providers and providers and they would all be coordinated by the counties?

01:47:06.194 --> 01:47:10.716
Under this proposed regional structure, county offices would apply to be regional leads.

01:47:11.236 --> 01:47:18.379
Then the regional leads would be the ones that help coordinate and maximize all the different state and federal programs that are out there.

01:47:20.119 --> 01:47:23.561
So, for example, a regional lead might have a lot of

01:47:25.197 --> 01:47:29.781
great support going on through a nonprofit provider in their region.

01:47:30.241 --> 01:47:35.905
And that nonprofit provider and that support would work with the regional lead to make sure it's coordinated and not duplicative.

01:47:36.926 --> 01:47:43.931
And so in that region, they don't have other organizations or structures also providing that support.

01:47:44.231 --> 01:47:49.796
Again, very high level, because I want to hear your feedback so then I could bring you back options or more detail.

01:47:51.038 --> 01:47:54.961
And what funding source would underline, would fund this regional structure?

01:47:55.542 --> 01:47:56.282
Great question.

01:47:56.923 --> 01:48:03.148
Do you all have any ideas for feedback on what funding sources could support this regional structure?

01:48:04.309 --> 01:48:05.830
I could also bring those back as options.

01:48:06.210 --> 01:48:06.911
That's a great question.

01:48:08.833 --> 01:48:11.094
Well, I'll let the board members proceed then.

01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:16.181
I just want to start with one comment.

01:48:16.201 --> 01:48:18.462
First of all, welcome to the board presentation.

01:48:18.582 --> 01:48:23.746
And thank you for your energy and your and your preparation for this item.

01:48:23.806 --> 01:48:27.608
I just want to tell you that we really appreciate your work in this area.

01:48:27.648 --> 01:48:32.971
And I think your background in leading the work at a school and in a district level will really help inform the work.

01:48:33.271 --> 01:48:44.720
So just to highlight, you had some key philosophy and guidelines that are underlying the rationale, and one that I want to reinforce is to make sure that you ask educators what would be helpful.

01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:55.428
Now you have that in there, but I think what we learned while we had really good intent with the last assistance that county offices did, it was often this is what you will do

01:48:56.028 --> 01:48:58.090
It's what the hammer, we say not the flashlight.

01:48:58.450 --> 01:49:05.296
And it was with best of intents with what they thought were the right practices and it didn't sustain and it was not collaborative.

01:49:05.336 --> 01:49:17.267
So I just want to reinforce that process as you develop this, that educators' voices of what would be helpful and processes and areas that they need should help inform the design of the regional work.

01:49:19.809 --> 01:49:20.490
Board Member Burr.

01:49:23.173 --> 01:49:23.554
Thank you.

01:49:23.614 --> 01:49:24.394
Also, welcome.

01:49:24.995 --> 01:49:27.616
We've had other conversations in the past about this.

01:49:28.097 --> 01:49:30.479
And so I sort of wear two hats here, right?

01:49:30.559 --> 01:49:37.003
The accountability, one of the accountability liaisons for LCFF and also the chair of CCEE.

01:49:37.463 --> 01:49:38.965
So just as kind of background,

01:49:39.645 --> 01:49:45.030
for at CCEE, we're also having some of these conversations about what do we want to be when we grow up?

01:49:45.150 --> 01:49:49.534
What is the intention of CCEE as a support mechanism?

01:49:49.594 --> 01:49:54.859
So, I appreciate the conversations that you're having to try to coordinate that.

01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:59.122
But I want to echo a little bit what board member Strauss said.

01:49:59.222 --> 01:50:10.728
I worry a little bit that, and I know you guys have tried really hard not to make it sound like this, but I live sort of in the past, that this is a compliant, it becomes a little bit of a compliance mechanism.

01:50:11.168 --> 01:50:15.271
And it's a little bit of, hi, we're here from Sacramento and we're here to help you.

01:50:16.051 --> 01:50:19.173
As opposed to saying, what do LEAs need?

01:50:19.813 --> 01:50:35.437
And so one really specific suggestion I would make, Melanie, is that we, in all of the conversations, these quarterly meetings that you're having to try to coordinate across the state level agencies, CCE, CDE, the county offices, you have LEAs there.

01:50:36.197 --> 01:50:40.778
So that they can be telling you these are the kinds of things that we expect we're going to need.

01:50:42.299 --> 01:50:56.633
I was very intrigued by a letter that we got from the Orange County superintendent who apparently has a regional structure and just received $30 million around the multi-tiered system of support.

01:50:57.033 --> 01:50:58.975
And I know we're going to talk more about this since

01:50:59.395 --> 01:51:16.729
where our data is revealing that our students with disabilities is the subgroup that pops up as the one that, at least in our data simulations, we really need to be attentive to, recognizing that students with disabilities can also be one or more of the other categories of high-needs students.

01:51:17.330 --> 01:51:20.712
So I would really want to understand how that system

01:51:21.693 --> 01:51:27.416
Because that seems to me to be a good starting point, honestly, because that's what multi-tiered systems of support are about.

01:51:27.977 --> 01:51:31.159
Everybody improving instruction in their first classroom.

01:51:31.699 --> 01:51:34.360
So I want to hear a little bit more about that.

01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:43.746
And again, just continue to look at this from the other lens, because I worry that there are multiple purposes trying to be served here.

01:51:45.009 --> 01:51:57.275
My favorite friends at the federal level have a lot of compliance that they want for the department to be sure they're ensuring, which is inconsistent with our philosophy about continuous improvement.

01:51:57.735 --> 01:52:02.677
So I sort of want to know how we're going to reconcile those kind of competing needs.

01:52:03.077 --> 01:52:08.080
And I think to President Kirsch's question, can you really do that with one structure?

01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:09.340
I don't know.

01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:10.881
I really appreciate the attempt to

01:52:11.361 --> 01:52:22.670
eliminate redundancy and not have LEAs kind of pulled, you know, from one pole to the other about, you know, here's what you're supposed to do for the feds and no, you don't have to do that for the state.

01:52:23.050 --> 01:52:28.114
I just think we have to be really attentive and we have to be willing to say this is a very new approach.

01:52:28.194 --> 01:52:40.764
This is an approach of working alongside the LEAs to help build their capacity to improve student learning rather than us coming in with a here's our recipe for what you need to do.

01:52:44.964 --> 01:52:47.528
Member Ortiz-Lacon.

01:52:47.989 --> 01:52:48.369
Welcome.

01:52:48.690 --> 01:52:52.375
You can tell you're new because you have so much energy and I really appreciate that.

01:52:53.757 --> 01:52:54.518
I appreciate that.

01:52:57.273 --> 01:53:02.434
Some people keep on day two, five minutes before the meeting ends.

01:53:02.794 --> 01:53:06.735
So I agree with what has been previously stated.

01:53:07.436 --> 01:53:08.856
I know that this is very high level.

01:53:08.916 --> 01:53:11.116
And you said that sometimes people knock on the wrong door.

01:53:11.517 --> 01:53:15.418
Well, sometimes they they're allowed to go in just to find another door and another door.

01:53:15.518 --> 01:53:15.738
Right.

01:53:15.778 --> 01:53:17.058
And so I think that that's

01:53:17.618 --> 01:53:27.944
As I was looking at this, I think this is a great idea, but there's going to be so many things that have to be considered, not only integrating at the regional level, but institutionalizing it at the local level.

01:53:28.364 --> 01:53:35.088
Because so often when these regional approaches take place, a lot of it is just rests on one person.

01:53:35.128 --> 01:53:40.692
And if that person leaves, then the whole partnership, the work, there's a lack of continuity.

01:53:41.132 --> 01:53:46.495
So institutionalizing it at the LEA or at the county and LEA level will be critical.

01:53:47.321 --> 01:53:54.770
I think for me, the goal would answer the question, how can the proposed regional structure be designed to support one system, one integrated?

01:53:55.431 --> 01:54:06.705
And that would, you know, once we get down to the very basics, would be making sure people understand their role and their responsibility and having the power to execute that role and that responsibility, making sure that

01:54:07.205 --> 01:54:13.172
somebody at the school level understands where do I go, who is my point of contact.

01:54:13.513 --> 01:54:16.496
So formalizing through memorandums of understanding.

01:54:16.576 --> 01:54:18.058
So there's all those little details.

01:54:18.519 --> 01:54:24.266
But I think what's important for us to also keep in mind is that there's going to be some regional

01:54:25.467 --> 01:54:31.234
clusters that will be larger than others and perhaps provide a better proposal.

01:54:31.795 --> 01:54:44.811
And we need to make sure that we max, that there's a maximum to how big those regional clusters can be because the bigger you go, the less services and the more the difficult it gets layered and so people will not be able to navigate that properly.

01:54:45.251 --> 01:54:53.099
But we also want to make sure that we keep in mind some of the smaller county offices and districts that may not have that competitive advantage when they submit that proposal.

01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:58.805
So, a lot to consider and I have a bunch of little smaller things here and I'm happy to share those with you.

01:54:59.606 --> 01:55:00.126
Thank you.

01:55:02.509 --> 01:55:06.092
Okay, Board Member Rocker.

01:55:06.112 --> 01:55:06.773
My notes over here.

01:55:07.334 --> 01:55:07.554
Here we go.

01:55:08.041 --> 01:55:09.782
Okay, so first of all, we've met before.

01:55:09.802 --> 01:55:16.184
I had a chance to meet and work with you on a previous meeting in preparation for today's conversation.

01:55:16.264 --> 01:55:19.565
So, welcome to your first presentation.

01:55:19.585 --> 01:55:20.625
You're doing really well.

01:55:20.906 --> 01:55:21.306
Thanks.

01:55:23.126 --> 01:55:23.987
That's the good news.

01:55:24.267 --> 01:55:25.307
The bad news is... Oh no!

01:55:28.408 --> 01:55:31.110
I have a whole lot of questions.

01:55:31.190 --> 01:55:39.717
And I tried to warn the staff earlier by saying, you know, the Oxford English Dictionary adds about three words a year to its dictionary.

01:55:39.777 --> 01:55:43.420
And I pay attention to that because I'm a reformed English teacher.

01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:47.063
And so that the word they added this year was woke.

01:55:47.975 --> 01:56:07.347
And that's important to me because part of the reason why this document is not working for me is the reformed English teacher in me says, the reason why this document see, the reason why we say the document is operating at a high level, when you say that this is a high level draft, that means there's a lot of stuff in here you don't know the answers to.

01:56:08.396 --> 01:56:18.940
And so but what the reason why the document and I'm understanding that there are gaps in what is intended to be written into this document to describe the statewide system of support.

01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:25.562
It's not working for me right now because there's a lot of metaphors in this document and they're all mixed together.

01:56:26.203 --> 01:56:29.784
And so let me give you an example of where the problem for me begins.

01:56:30.344 --> 01:56:34.446
The basic unit of change is not at the school level.

01:56:35.526 --> 01:56:38.528
The basic unit of change is the student.

01:56:38.928 --> 01:56:51.155
Because the purpose of this system of support is to improve and develop the district and the school's awareness of where they are failing students.

01:56:51.575 --> 01:56:55.758
And in particular, where these failures create the performance gap.

01:56:56.218 --> 01:57:00.582
between African-American and Hispanic students and other students at the school.

01:57:01.062 --> 01:57:23.239
So the basic unit of change is supposed to be how is this intervention and how is this support not only going to improve access for those students, but improve their performance because it's their performance that has to change to tell us that whatever you're doing for intervention and whatever you're doing for planning has worked.

01:57:24.904 --> 01:57:36.234
The basic failure of what we have done in previous intervention models fails to take into accountability how we put the student at the center as the basic unit of change.

01:57:36.774 --> 01:57:40.878
Now, unit of change is a term of art that comes from math and science.

01:57:41.278 --> 01:57:46.102
And so the other part of that conversation about unit of change is dimension.

01:57:46.622 --> 01:57:49.845
Multi-tiered systems of instruction are about the dimension.

01:57:50.246 --> 01:57:52.868
And so this is where the metaphors start getting mixed up.

01:57:53.368 --> 01:58:01.376
And so, as you look at what those levels of differentiation, those levels of intervention are, how are they connected?

01:58:01.836 --> 01:58:06.641
That's not clearly defined or explained in the document among the levels.

01:58:07.222 --> 01:58:17.732
It's clear that there's some intentionality while we want to have a single coherent system to do this support, it is very clear that the system is not intended

01:58:18.092 --> 01:58:24.014
to be a one-size-fits-all, collect something from column A, column B, and column C, and then here's your plan.

01:58:24.054 --> 01:58:28.155
It's clear that that's not the intention, but that's not very well spelled out.

01:58:29.195 --> 01:58:37.137
The third piece of this that makes it difficult for me to follow is not only what is the unit of change, but what is the

01:58:38.655 --> 01:58:39.935
Conversation piece.

01:58:40.616 --> 01:58:42.916
Is it the LC, is it the LCAP plan?

01:58:43.536 --> 01:58:46.717
Is it the district's multi-tiered system of instruction plan?

01:58:47.138 --> 01:58:49.518
Is it the district's response to intervention plan?

01:58:49.898 --> 01:58:55.720
It is not clear and that may be stepping over the line from the how to the what.

01:58:56.280 --> 01:59:02.422
But what is it that's driving the decisions that will define what the intervention is?

01:59:02.822 --> 01:59:04.743
Is it what the data should be telling us?

01:59:05.243 --> 01:59:06.924
from our dashboard.

01:59:07.264 --> 01:59:16.351
It is unclear what actually drives or becomes the foundational piece that defines the architecture of the interventions that will be done.

01:59:16.731 --> 01:59:18.392
That's not very well spelled out.

01:59:19.232 --> 01:59:28.339
The other piece for me that becomes of great concern is how does the system, it doesn't, there's no exit strategy.

01:59:28.739 --> 01:59:34.543
So once you get, and I know that this is still at the beginning of the conversation, but when you go in,

01:59:35.383 --> 01:59:41.466
You know, you need to kind of know where the exit points are going to be or what those exit strategies are going to be.

01:59:41.506 --> 01:59:43.907
That needs to also be clearly spelled out.

01:59:44.327 --> 01:59:56.352
For example, the collaborative may have a larger role in some schools at the beginning of this process and their role in intervention over time may become less important.

01:59:56.672 --> 02:00:04.335
That's not really well articulated here and how the relationship among the providers with the LEA may change.

02:00:04.975 --> 02:00:23.631
It's also, and then finally, and I'm going to stop here because there really is so much more that I can say, but I'm making the effort not only to stay, I'm making the effort not only to stay woke about what I'm, the students that I think we should be paying attention to, but also about the fact this is your first time and I want you to like me when I'm done giving this comment.

02:00:25.438 --> 02:00:35.282
The third piece, the last piece, last and final piece, I did five fingers, so the last and final piece for me today is to talk about the evaluation.

02:00:35.462 --> 02:00:37.463
How do you evaluate the process?

02:00:37.823 --> 02:00:51.788
There should be some ongoing, integral, periodic, and final evaluation, not only about the performance of the providers, but what was the outcome of the program, what did we learn from doing the intervention,

02:00:52.328 --> 02:00:57.030
And are there things that can be improved as we continue down this road?

02:00:57.390 --> 02:01:00.392
And so I didn't see that being given consideration at all.

02:01:00.812 --> 02:01:03.173
It's one thing to have an accountability system.

02:01:03.573 --> 02:01:08.475
It's one thing to use the data in that accountability system to plan interventions for schools.

02:01:08.935 --> 02:01:16.899
But one of our principal failures over time has been we fail to hold ourselves accountable for the outcomes of our intervention.

02:01:17.299 --> 02:01:20.960
the state process, the date process, the use of the API.

02:01:21.380 --> 02:01:39.364
We all can sit up here and say, well, those were a disappointment, but this plan doesn't clearly articulate to me what we've learned from those, I'm saying disappointment, not failures, what we have learned from those systems to make sure we're not replicating the same mistakes.

02:01:39.704 --> 02:01:46.606
If we do the same things we've always done, and I see some of those same things, we're going to get the same outcomes we've always gotten.

02:01:48.905 --> 02:01:49.325
Yeah.

02:01:51.125 --> 02:01:52.206
OK, Bruce is next.

02:01:54.346 --> 02:01:55.306
Thank you.

02:01:55.806 --> 02:01:56.146
Thank you.

02:01:56.487 --> 02:02:03.228
I think so much of what you said, Member Rucker, is so important and needs to be fleshed out as you move along through this process.

02:02:04.248 --> 02:02:14.690
I'd like to simplify a little bit what many of the board members have said about sort of the attitude, the approach of the people who will be supporting our LEAs.

02:02:15.170 --> 02:02:17.791
And that very simply is to listen.

02:02:18.471 --> 02:02:19.031
in the beginning.

02:02:19.292 --> 02:02:27.596
I think listening instead of starting the conversation with talking, but instead starting the conversation with listening is just incredibly important in this situation.

02:02:28.356 --> 02:02:34.759
And taking the time to learn about the situation and the challenges and all that.

02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:46.685
But what I'm also not seeing in this is the support that the providers, the district leads will receive.

02:02:48.428 --> 02:02:58.194
It's obvious that there are any number of wonderful people involved in County Office of Ed who can share their wisdom with all sorts of people.

02:02:58.634 --> 02:03:01.075
But what is the ongoing training process?

02:03:01.115 --> 02:03:17.345
Maybe this is a CCE, CE whatever, the collaborative role here is to provide ongoing trainings and coordinate among the various regional entities and say who's being successful and why and what are their practices and that sort of thing.

02:03:17.785 --> 02:03:25.772
There has to be an ongoing improvement process for these people just as much as for the LEAs.

02:03:27.073 --> 02:03:27.353
Thank you.

02:03:27.373 --> 02:03:28.214
Okay, who else?

02:03:29.415 --> 02:03:30.076
Board Member Sun.

02:03:31.821 --> 02:03:36.304
And this might be an echo of what has been said already.

02:03:36.844 --> 02:03:45.050
So we know that we don't want to be prescriptive and we want folks at the local level to take that responsibility.

02:03:45.110 --> 02:03:57.258
And because we don't want to be prescriptive and this is in the manner of assistance, then we need to very clearly focus on roles, responsibility

02:03:58.158 --> 02:04:00.699
and ultimately the accountability for it.

02:04:01.119 --> 02:04:10.001
And I love what board member Rucker said about the locus of change is with the student.

02:04:10.581 --> 02:04:19.383
And so what are the various roles from the school to the parent, to the student themselves, to the district level

02:04:20.143 --> 02:04:23.425
administrators, all those, what are their roles in that change?

02:04:23.765 --> 02:04:25.546
And then what are their responsibilities?

02:04:26.086 --> 02:04:28.728
And then who ultimately is accountable for that?

02:04:30.028 --> 02:04:40.294
And so I think when we're developing the structure, I think that's where we need to focus, not on what support providers, what kinds of things that need to be put into this list.

02:04:40.834 --> 02:04:43.856
It is more around clearly the responsibilities.

02:04:45.868 --> 02:04:50.830
Yeah, I think you need a map of what's out there now.

02:04:51.170 --> 02:04:55.912
I mean, you know, there's a list in the document.

02:04:56.233 --> 02:05:01.555
And it's, as I understand it, mostly public agencies established in statute.

02:05:02.571 --> 02:05:05.334
But I would call WestEd a provider out there.

02:05:05.495 --> 02:05:08.198
I would call the New Teacher Center a provider.

02:05:08.658 --> 02:05:13.644
I would call the many networks at Gates Foundation.

02:05:13.965 --> 02:05:20.492
There are MOOCs out there that are very active in California.

02:05:21.373 --> 02:05:23.534
and that come into California.

02:05:23.974 --> 02:05:28.216
It's not just what's in our own borders, you know, that help teachers.

02:05:29.276 --> 02:05:36.038
There's a mathematics one and an English learner one, both run by colleagues of mine at Stanford.

02:05:36.078 --> 02:05:40.840
So it's, there's all kinds of things going on in

02:05:42.044 --> 02:05:50.589
And I think we've never relied strictly on public agencies to do and statutory agencies to do this job.

02:05:51.369 --> 02:06:00.774
So I don't, in having, so what, I don't know who's coordinating, I don't know how to coordinate something.

02:06:00.854 --> 02:06:02.595
I don't quite know what there's all about.

02:06:03.075 --> 02:06:05.896
I think you're on the Monday, on some phone calls we've been on.

02:06:06.056 --> 02:06:13.357
And, you know, there's all kinds of agencies out there that are working on these things.

02:06:13.437 --> 02:06:18.219
So, the public-private mix bothers me.

02:06:18.859 --> 02:06:21.959
There are for-fee providers out there.

02:06:22.079 --> 02:06:24.200
I don't know whether they should be considered or not.

02:06:25.576 --> 02:06:27.617
Pivot learning is one, for example.

02:06:27.717 --> 02:06:32.240
Are they exempt from coordination because they're charged a fee or something?

02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:35.302
And it's just huge.

02:06:35.522 --> 02:06:38.064
And districts have a lot of options.

02:06:38.864 --> 02:06:45.629
And in this highly huge state, you need a lot of flexibility to blend them together.

02:06:46.753 --> 02:07:00.205
So, you know, some public thing under counties, it just strikes me as counterintuitive to the way the world works in this kind of a state where we have lots of entrants that are coming in.

02:07:00.506 --> 02:07:10.855
So that's, there's an agency that, there's agencies here that are non-profits

02:07:12.376 --> 02:07:13.737
from out of state.

02:07:13.837 --> 02:07:19.160
There's one that works on strategic resource allocation out of Massachusetts.

02:07:19.460 --> 02:07:20.981
There's Jobs for the Future.

02:07:21.762 --> 02:07:23.403
I mean, all of these are private.

02:07:23.483 --> 02:07:25.544
I work particularly in CTE.

02:07:27.245 --> 02:07:38.552
So if you're just coordinating the public and you got all this private action out there, then I don't know how you put them together

02:07:39.341 --> 02:07:47.326
And I don't know whether counties are particularly equipped to do this public-private mix and interweaving.

02:07:47.547 --> 02:08:00.756
So that's what has me on thinking about this in many ways, because it's not going to be a one-size-fits-all public system, that's for sure.

02:08:01.621 --> 02:08:10.485
But it's not going to be all public money either in terms of how and public providers on how this comes in.

02:08:11.125 --> 02:08:14.607
There's all, I think there'll be a growth in virtual providers as well.

02:08:14.727 --> 02:08:19.669
I mean, all the studies show teachers going online, teacher groups going online.

02:08:20.689 --> 02:08:21.830
in many ways.

02:08:23.551 --> 02:08:28.333
So it, yeah, I'm, you know, sort of reeling because I can't get all this.

02:08:28.653 --> 02:08:31.274
We have a digital library in Smarter Balanced.

02:08:31.354 --> 02:08:32.695
It seems to me that's something.

02:08:33.415 --> 02:08:38.438
So I don't know how these counties are going to, you know, get a hold of all of this and put it all together.

02:08:41.459 --> 02:08:41.839
Thank you.

02:08:42.499 --> 02:08:43.500
Again, Carrick Ashley.

02:08:46.181 --> 02:08:49.264
So Melanie is a very quick study.

02:08:50.304 --> 02:09:01.933
When we talked about the board item yesterday, and I told her if you get the question about funding, don't get tripped into going straight to the federal programs, right?

02:09:02.754 --> 02:09:03.155
Good job.

02:09:05.618 --> 02:09:10.303
So as you'll notice, the title of the item is about state and federal programs.

02:09:11.845 --> 02:09:20.015
We pulled it out specifically from the ESSA state plan, which is the next item of which system of support has to be discussed in that item.

02:09:20.996 --> 02:09:27.600
This really is about trying to do just like our dashboard and everything else, be California driven, not federally driven.

02:09:28.501 --> 02:09:33.665
We do have, currently, regions of system of support now.

02:09:33.785 --> 02:09:37.687
We do it through Title I, through the 11 successor regions.

02:09:38.148 --> 02:09:43.651
We do have what's called county leads for Title III, our federal Title III program.

02:09:43.871 --> 02:09:46.133
Those are also housed in some county offices.

02:09:46.573 --> 02:09:48.134
We have other regional programs.

02:09:48.174 --> 02:09:50.135
I think Afterschools has a regional program.

02:09:51.116 --> 02:09:51.497
Excuse me.

02:09:51.918 --> 02:09:56.909
So we have regional programs that we do have control over.

02:09:57.819 --> 02:10:06.822
And then there are regional programs that are funded with state funding that we, Department of Ed, doesn't necessarily have control over.

02:10:07.522 --> 02:10:09.162
But we've got CCEE.

02:10:09.462 --> 02:10:14.624
We've got, as was mentioned before, the MTSS that's working out of Orange County.

02:10:15.164 --> 02:10:17.524
So there are some things that we can control.

02:10:18.005 --> 02:10:22.746
There are other agencies providing support that we have.

02:10:23.186 --> 02:10:27.748
An inroad to, for instance, the superintendent sits on the board for CCEE.

02:10:28.128 --> 02:10:42.414
We don't control it, but we have these quarterly state agency meetings to coordinate that work and to collaborate on that work so we can come to an agreement and a coordination so we don't have the duplication.

02:10:42.854 --> 02:10:45.035
And then there's kind of a third set of providers.

02:10:45.315 --> 02:10:47.195
You mentioned Pivot and others out there.

02:10:47.215 --> 02:10:50.436
There are a lot of people providing those kind of services.

02:10:50.856 --> 02:11:04.099
I think what we can do with those is to provide a framework of saying what we are doing with the agencies that we have control over or with we collaborate, this is the framework that we're working under.

02:11:04.439 --> 02:11:10.601
And if you want to be a provider, a private provider in California, we would strongly suggest

02:11:11.021 --> 02:11:14.163
that you follow this same sort of model that we are using.

02:11:14.383 --> 02:11:16.264
They're obviously not obligated to do that.

02:11:16.824 --> 02:11:27.610
But this idea of bypassing school districts and going straight into a school to give them large grants under school improvement didn't prove to be very successful.

02:11:28.150 --> 02:11:32.052
So we're talking about building capacity at a school district level.

02:11:32.072 --> 02:11:39.476
And so if we've got some guiding principles, some frameworks on how to do that to communicate that with these private providers,

02:11:40.456 --> 02:11:43.597
Hopefully, they take our lead of where the state of California is going.

02:11:43.938 --> 02:11:47.759
Not that we can control it, but perhaps we can help coordinate.

02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:52.961
I'm worried about the phrase our model, but I'll have to, yeah.

02:11:53.222 --> 02:11:54.082
Who is next here?

02:11:54.162 --> 02:11:57.123
Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe, you haven't gotten in, so let me.

02:11:57.904 --> 02:11:58.244
Okay.

02:11:58.944 --> 02:12:00.124
Board Member Sun is next.

02:12:00.445 --> 02:12:01.225
Yeah, go ahead.

02:12:02.566 --> 02:12:16.712
Yes, and I really, really hope that as we're developing this system of support that we are moving away from buying reform in a box, that we're not just buying a program or buying this and somehow that's going to just cure the problem.

02:12:17.052 --> 02:12:19.793
And because it hasn't worked before and it isn't going to work.

02:12:20.153 --> 02:12:30.498
So what I'm seeing is that the support, the capacity building part of it is reinvesting back into the school to the stakeholders in the school to have time to have conversations.

02:12:31.098 --> 02:12:37.481
to do for teachers to observe each other and and work with each other and plan together.

02:12:37.801 --> 02:12:39.962
So it's not about buying something.

02:12:40.002 --> 02:12:45.725
And I really hope that we kind of keep that at bay and allow folks to work together.

02:12:46.005 --> 02:12:48.526
That is the key to making change.

02:12:53.553 --> 02:13:05.227
Yeah, I think, Mike, to your comments about this kind of array of people out there that are trying to help districts or help schools, the key point is the one that board member Sun brought up earlier.

02:13:05.348 --> 02:13:07.270
It's who's accountable for that.

02:13:07.911 --> 02:13:12.556
And I think what the system that we're trying to talk about here and devise

02:13:13.277 --> 02:13:15.199
says we're accountable, right?

02:13:15.539 --> 02:13:25.786
And whether it's through our LCFF accountability, our integrated accountability, or what the feds expect from us, ultimately it comes back to us.

02:13:25.886 --> 02:13:38.636
And we have to have some level of confidence that the support and assistance that's being provided is doing exactly what board member Sun said, building the capacity of teachers to improve their work with students.

02:13:39.416 --> 02:13:50.624
So it may be that, you know, whoever is helping to manage this says, gee, WestEd would be a great person to come in or they're really working on CTE and it would be great to bring in jobs for.

02:13:51.044 --> 02:14:01.672
But it does, if we're accountable, we have to build a structure to me in a way that says, yeah, we own this and this is who we're relying on to provide that kind of assistance.

02:14:02.412 --> 02:14:12.639
The last thing I just wanted to mention about CCEE's work, and I know you're hearing this in your meetings, but, you know, and Superintendent Torlaks and I have been privileged to hear these conversations.

02:14:12.940 --> 02:14:16.062
They have a lot of work going on right now testing out things.

02:14:16.082 --> 02:14:23.227
They've got 10 or 11 pilot districts, one county office they're working with to do these kinds of conversations.

02:14:23.747 --> 02:14:36.352
We've also just invested several million dollars in a number of peer-to-peer networks to try to again have LEAs help each other, nonprofit organizations help each other to improve their practice.

02:14:36.392 --> 02:14:52.058
So I hope we'll be learning from that again to kind of refocus how we're thinking about support and assistance and to try to move away from the sort of categorical compliance checklist here, buy a box, do this recipe.

02:14:53.442 --> 02:15:03.842
But I'm worried that these words, an integrated statewide system of support, integrated system, integrated system and regional structure,

02:15:04.946 --> 02:15:09.930
You know, what if I'm out there and I got a really good and I'm a provider, but I don't fit into your integrated system.

02:15:10.030 --> 02:15:12.171
I mean, this is back to date and state to me.

02:15:12.371 --> 02:15:13.392
You know, I've been there.

02:15:13.472 --> 02:15:20.117
And, you know, once you get government into saying, here's your integrated system, fit into this system.

02:15:20.437 --> 02:15:22.459
And if you don't fit, you're not part of it.

02:15:24.767 --> 02:15:28.669
strikes me as not a way to go about this.

02:15:28.869 --> 02:15:30.509
There's a market out there.

02:15:30.629 --> 02:15:31.350
I mean, you're... I know.

02:15:31.450 --> 02:15:34.731
And it's not intended to be exclusionary.

02:15:34.811 --> 02:15:36.952
It's intended to say there are a lot of resources.

02:15:37.272 --> 02:15:38.773
How are we going to coordinate them?

02:15:39.653 --> 02:15:41.774
And how are we going to assess, number one,

02:15:42.194 --> 02:15:43.416
how they're doing with students.

02:15:43.776 --> 02:15:44.577
What are their needs?

02:15:45.098 --> 02:15:47.862
Because I'll say the opposite of the market driven.

02:15:48.262 --> 02:15:55.472
I love the fact that we have cottage industries that sprang up, but that's what happens every time we have a state funded or federal funded program.

02:15:56.073 --> 02:15:58.856
Remember our experience with SES providers.

02:15:59.477 --> 02:16:01.458
which turned out to not be very good.

02:16:01.959 --> 02:16:09.043
So I just think we have to sort of keep in mind all those things and not exclude people because there are lots of people that have very good expertise.

02:16:09.844 --> 02:16:16.508
But we, again, as the State Policymaking Board, in my view, have the responsibility to be accountable for that work.

02:16:19.586 --> 02:16:31.974
One thing we discussed at CPAG in the June CPAG meeting was how do we make sure we're getting the right resources at the right time to the right people and aligning those resources with their locally identified needs.

02:16:32.014 --> 02:16:41.380
So I just think that adds a little bit more what board member Burr was talking around the coordination and what's our responsibility in helping that process of getting the right resources at the right time.

02:16:41.740 --> 02:16:42.100
Sorry.

02:16:43.161 --> 02:16:44.321
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

02:16:46.309 --> 02:16:52.032
And President Curtis, I understand your concern, but I also think maybe integrated is not the best word.

02:16:52.092 --> 02:16:53.093
It's more cohesive.

02:16:53.513 --> 02:16:59.576
I think that if we don't have a system where we're trying to at least do some community mapping to figure out what's out there.

02:17:00.217 --> 02:17:08.521
And we do know that there's private, nonprofit, public, but we do also need all of those resources to build capacity and expand our capacity.

02:17:10.362 --> 02:17:11.443
So I think we need something.

02:17:11.523 --> 02:17:16.607
In the absence of that, we're just going to have people doing work in silos and no one's really going to know what's actually working.

02:17:17.007 --> 02:17:28.977
And we need to have a system in place where we could do some shared practices across the regions so that everyone has an understanding of what's out there beyond the limitation of my little parameter here in my regional area.

02:17:30.097 --> 02:17:35.800
Going back to board member Rucker, I love that the unit of change definitely should be the student.

02:17:36.301 --> 02:17:39.922
I think that we need some sort of logic model by tier.

02:17:40.343 --> 02:17:44.005
So tier one, starting with the student, but what would that look like?

02:17:44.325 --> 02:17:50.568
Tier two and tier three, because we are also in need of more clarity around what that support is going to look like.

02:17:50.928 --> 02:17:56.071
And maybe in doing an inventory of what's out there, we'll get a better sense of what our capacity is.

02:17:57.172 --> 02:18:11.785
I agree that there was no exit strategy in the next item, but there was also, you know, we had some numbers and it was hard for me to really distinguish if we go with intervention or support to this percentage of LEAs, do we have

02:18:12.365 --> 02:18:14.207
25% that we could cover versus 18%.

02:18:14.387 --> 02:18:17.049
I still don't know what our capacity is.

02:18:17.389 --> 02:18:23.194
And unless we start trying to figure out what's out there and how we're going to align our resources, we won't have that.

02:18:23.394 --> 02:18:29.759
And without knowing our capacity, we can move to identifying the bottom 5% or identifying the schools that are most in need and LEAs.

02:18:30.079 --> 02:18:30.379
Thank you.

02:18:33.742 --> 02:18:34.663
Board Member Rucker.

02:18:41.132 --> 02:18:52.754
So then going back to the comments that I made earlier, and I'm really happy to add some dimension to the comment I made earlier based on the feedback you've since received.

02:18:53.194 --> 02:19:02.236
A lot of the concern about this plan really is that I'm thinking what you heard really is about what right now is not in there.

02:19:02.696 --> 02:19:10.098
And while the goal of doing this draft was to try to lay out an architecture to explain how the intervention would work,

02:19:10.658 --> 02:19:15.641
and the different levels, who the entities would be that would be involved.

02:19:16.181 --> 02:19:24.486
I think the point has been made that there does need to be some detail when you look at and try to thread out what the dimensions of this plan would be.

02:19:24.966 --> 02:19:31.870
Not only how it operates at each level, what the form is, but there is going to have to be somewhat defining function.

02:19:32.230 --> 02:19:32.390
So,

02:19:32.890 --> 02:19:49.420
the form and function in writing out this plan becomes important because in the details of what you heard, particularly as it relates to selecting providers or identifying what the role of each of those providers would be, that really is about function and defining that.

02:19:49.980 --> 02:19:52.282
But as Board Member Burr pointed out,

02:19:53.559 --> 02:19:55.000
We are accountable for it.

02:19:55.380 --> 02:20:10.630
But accountability, in my experience, once it gets past the student who has to take the assessments or participate and do the work, or the teacher who is evaluated for it, at some point in time, accountability starts looking like, well, I guess that was wrong.

02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:18.495
There needs to be a different way of gauging accountability and implementing some level of accountability for the decisions that were made.

02:20:19.036 --> 02:20:22.618
Because even though we have this dashboard that is creating

02:20:22.998 --> 02:20:28.225
a great deal of transparency and giving us a truckload of new types of information.

02:20:28.906 --> 02:20:32.731
This plan is still based on a lot of data-free decision-making.

02:20:33.291 --> 02:20:40.601
And so there's still need, so the beauty of data-free decision-making is a wing and a prayer is all we need to hold ourselves accountable.

02:20:41.221 --> 02:20:46.986
But at the end of all of those things, we still end up with the same frustrations and the same failures.

02:20:47.366 --> 02:20:59.015
So if this plan is truly going to be data-driven, the added dimension that has to be in this plan is to define based on what data are the decisions for intervention being made.

02:20:59.375 --> 02:21:15.095
And so that is something else that the plan doesn't truly articulate as part of the how, is how will decisions about the intervention and the types of engagement that will be recommended will be driven by the data about the school.

02:21:15.615 --> 02:21:15.916
Thank you.

02:21:17.197 --> 02:21:17.778
Superintendent.

02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:19.440
Yeah, just a couple of reflections.

02:21:19.500 --> 02:21:22.621
This item was intended to be thought provoking, provocative.

02:21:23.141 --> 02:21:24.602
And it's a great discussion.

02:21:25.162 --> 02:21:26.562
And it does need a lot more detail.

02:21:26.582 --> 02:21:28.042
It is very complex.

02:21:28.883 --> 02:21:34.004
And I think, you know, some of the words we need to work on defining those or putting more in context.

02:21:34.904 --> 02:21:39.165
Perhaps again, integrated may not be integrated system of support may not be the right phrase.

02:21:39.225 --> 02:21:41.606
Maybe it's more the coordinating connected.

02:21:42.126 --> 02:21:59.646
and how do we more efficiently use, how do we share the great work that Sue Berger shared with you that's going on at the CCEE pilot programs, peer-to-peer best practices being developed, and how do you make sure that those opportunities to enjoy those discoveries and those synergisms

02:22:00.427 --> 02:22:08.834
is available around the state and that it's covered in the rural parts of the state and the valley parts of the state and big areas and rural areas.

02:22:09.354 --> 02:22:25.087
So I just thought the discussion is very good and focusing on capacity building, looking to the board and to you, President Kirsch, as we would go forward and a couple of you as board members have some more extensive lists of ideas and details.

02:22:25.807 --> 02:22:43.078
Could we have some liaison or two from the board to work or come to a couple of the meetings that Melanie and the group will be looking at so we can be sure to take into consideration not only the questions in debate today, but further thoughts you have about refining this and adding workable detail.

02:22:43.999 --> 02:22:49.623
And just one other connection point, we have just recently, I mentioned in my earlier remarks,

02:22:50.363 --> 02:22:55.788
the legislature granted 2.5 million dollars for an equity team or looking at how to close the achievement gap.

02:22:55.808 --> 02:23:03.435
And we're looking at deploying that five fellows over a period of three years in a regional format.

02:23:03.575 --> 02:23:11.943
And so how would that, you know, coordinate in and fit in or create some additional synergy along with the CCE projects and others of that like?

02:23:12.703 --> 02:23:15.105
So just a suggestion is going forward.

02:23:15.866 --> 02:23:20.009
Maybe Melanie, you can give us a time frame when you wanted to bring this back again.

02:23:20.029 --> 02:23:26.914
I think next meeting, but looking at the time context, we would be open to working closely with the board.

02:23:26.934 --> 02:23:30.457
Okay, board member Sandoval.

02:23:31.856 --> 02:23:32.236
Thank you.

02:23:32.256 --> 02:23:44.002
I appreciated all of the board comments that I heard and I just wanted to address one of the questions on how the proposed structure could be designed to support one more integrated or cohesive system.

02:23:44.022 --> 02:23:50.545
And I think just focusing on students and the root causes of their struggles is really essential, has to start there.

02:23:51.325 --> 02:23:58.689
And then coordinating solutions to the challenges in a manner that is as transparent as possible so that we can all learn

02:23:59.309 --> 02:24:01.410
from the problem solving strategies.

02:24:02.390 --> 02:24:07.411
And I think that's going to help us ensure accountability to each and every student.

02:24:08.351 --> 02:24:23.415
And I think I'm delighted to hear about the fellows and this work looking at equity because I think looking at disparities across groups and how we can help solve problems that we're seeing in our schools.

02:24:23.675 --> 02:24:25.315
So I just wanted to offer that.

02:24:28.015 --> 02:24:33.465
Okay, are we ready for some public, we have public comment on this item, then we could resume our discussion.

02:24:34.607 --> 02:24:36.871
Somebody call the roll for the public comment.

02:24:50.168 --> 02:24:52.490
We have the following speakers for public comment.

02:24:52.610 --> 02:24:53.350
Please line up.

02:24:53.770 --> 02:25:06.839
Christina Olmsted, Deborah Sims, Leila Fahimuddin, Sandy Mendoza, Liz Guillen, Martha Alvarez, Ralph Porras, and Lisa Morris, or Liza Morris.

02:25:14.093 --> 02:25:14.633
Good morning.

02:25:14.833 --> 02:25:19.375
I'm Christine Olmsted, the Associate Superintendent of Instruction for the Orange County Department of Education.

02:25:19.395 --> 02:25:28.638
And here on behalf of Alma Harris, our County Superintendent of Schools in Orange County, as well as Tim Taylor, our Butte County Superintendent of Schools representing rural California for us.

02:25:29.338 --> 02:25:32.420
And my colleague Susan Huckanin is in the room with me today as well.

02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:49.030
And we just wanted to come today to let you know that this regional system of support, what it looks like and what it turns into is working for the work that we're doing and that you've entrusted us to do with the $30 million that you've given us to scale MTSS statewide.

02:25:49.810 --> 02:26:05.057
And so being able to depend on our region leads and our county office leads to be conveners for the trainings that we have to do to get consistency across the state with a multi-tiered system of support framework is one avenue.

02:26:06.897 --> 02:26:08.818
Definitely hear everything you're saying.

02:26:08.838 --> 02:26:13.320
It is not a come in and buy a program.

02:26:13.720 --> 02:26:17.162
We are working with districts to look at their own resources

02:26:18.806 --> 02:26:20.807
and we'll give you an update later when you're ready.

02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:30.171
Good afternoon, good morning.

02:26:31.251 --> 02:26:43.536
My name is Deborah Sims and I'm the Director of Strategic Systems and Innovation for Pivot Learning and I'm here today representing our CEO, Dr. Arun Ramanathan.

02:26:44.456 --> 02:26:51.140
We're pleased that you're addressing these key policy issues related to the development of a statewide system of support.

02:26:51.680 --> 02:27:07.670
Pivot Learning has joined together with other nonprofit technical assistance providers committed to improving the outcomes for our state's diverse population and to provide recommendations on this proposed system.

02:27:08.810 --> 02:27:12.652
Our organizations work in communities across California.

02:27:13.353 --> 02:27:34.124
Equity, excellence, and accountability are our core values, and our approach is underscored by partnering with working with LEAs and stakeholders to create and strengthen coherent systems, to build capacity, and to improve craft knowledge, all in efforts to significantly increase student success.

02:27:34.304 --> 02:27:34.544
Time.

02:27:36.909 --> 02:27:48.986
I just, as I'm leaving, I'd just like you to refer back to the letter that we've sent you with our three guiding principles for you to consider around working with our nonprofits.

02:27:49.226 --> 02:27:49.527
Thank you.

02:27:55.489 --> 02:27:56.329
Good morning, members.

02:27:56.529 --> 02:28:01.351
My name is Leila Fahimuddin, and I'm with the National Center for Youth Law's Foster Ed California Initiative.

02:28:01.971 --> 02:28:20.177
We work in close partnership with local and regional collaboratives of school districts, county offices of education, child welfare agencies, probation agencies, and impacted young people and their caregivers to coordinate supports and services for system-involved youth in order to improve the educational outcomes for all young people.

02:28:20.977 --> 02:28:36.827
We, along with our colleagues at organizations such as Pivot Learning Partners, Families in Schools, and others, have a track record of providing effective technical assistance and capacity development to local LEAs in meeting their LCFF goals and priorities for their most impacted students.

02:28:37.527 --> 02:28:53.842
As the board and department continue to develop the integrated system of supports for LEAs, we ask you to be sure to include non-profit equity focused organizations like ours that bring trusting relationships with LEAs, practice expertise and resources for marginalized youth to the table.

02:28:54.303 --> 02:29:02.330
Our students stand to benefit when our systems have the ability to leverage both public resources and the high quality diverse non-profit resources in their communities.

02:29:02.650 --> 02:29:02.851
Time.

02:29:08.837 --> 02:29:11.701
Good morning, Sandy Mendoza with Families in Schools.

02:29:12.382 --> 02:29:17.229
We have joined with colleagues to provide recommendations on the state system of support.

02:29:17.750 --> 02:29:25.340
We are working on the LCAP process with communities around the state and we appreciate the opportunity to share our perspectives with the board.

02:29:26.101 --> 02:29:35.307
An effective system of support will provide LEAs with opportunities to make sure the system fits with local context and is based on partnership and respect.

02:29:35.908 --> 02:29:45.074
We recommend that the system create a process that assures quality, yet supports diversity and the breadth and providers to meet the variety of needs of LEAs.

02:29:45.894 --> 02:29:57.608
While we are supportive of the idea of regional leads for local assistance and support, we think the language around partnering or subcontracting should be encouraged rather than left as permissive.

02:29:58.329 --> 02:30:05.517
As noted in our letter, our organizations work in partnership with LEAs and have relationships built on trust and respect.

02:30:06.198 --> 02:30:12.160
We believe that the state system should take an inclusive approach that leverages the depth and breadth of expertise in California.

02:30:13.180 --> 02:30:22.283
The capacity of LA's county offices and the CCEE will be strengthened by a system that opens doors and provide with providers who have strong track records.

02:30:22.363 --> 02:30:23.023
Thank you so much.

02:30:27.779 --> 02:30:29.779
Good morning, Marta Alvarez on behalf of AXA.

02:30:30.560 --> 02:30:34.180
I'll keep my comments high level given that we have a speaker right after me with more details.

02:30:34.880 --> 02:30:40.322
We have heard from the field the importance about making sure that this system of support is customized and individualized.

02:30:40.862 --> 02:30:43.722
We want to ensure that we think about the what.

02:30:44.422 --> 02:30:57.345
So we have been engaging administrators in this conversation thinking about what they need, what capacity building looks like for them, what are the skills and knowledge and leadership that they need to develop to become better professionals to be able to make the right decisions on behalf of kids.

02:30:57.805 --> 02:31:09.738
So we're thinking about the what, then we're thinking about the how would we provide the support from the state, county, CCE, all the different entities, and then moving on to the how would that be provided and who provides it.

02:31:10.139 --> 02:31:15.084
And so we would like to welcome the opportunity to participate in these conversations with you at a greater

02:31:16.706 --> 02:31:18.467
We have a lot of comments we have received.

02:31:18.968 --> 02:31:23.071
We have not focused on the regional structure because it's a new item just released less than 10 days ago.

02:31:23.712 --> 02:31:24.652
But we do have comments.

02:31:25.133 --> 02:31:27.935
One last thing I'll say, a repository of best practices.

02:31:28.315 --> 02:31:35.461
Before we talk about people coming in and providing support, how can we allow for districts to be able to go search, how to reduce suspension rates?

02:31:35.761 --> 02:31:37.863
We'll talk about establishing that dashboard.

02:31:38.063 --> 02:31:38.424
Thank you.

02:31:39.545 --> 02:31:41.586
I'd like to call the next group of speakers.

02:31:42.527 --> 02:31:44.729
Christy Sinclair, Jason Henderson.

02:31:45.129 --> 02:31:55.852
Giselle Viveros, Angela Del Ramos, Eric Premack, Lorraine Richards, Carrie Hannel, Mary Perry, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz, and Shelley Spiegel-Coleman.

02:32:03.171 --> 02:32:04.592
Good morning, members of the board.

02:32:04.873 --> 02:32:10.838
Ralph Gomez-Porras, Superintendent for Pacific River Unified School District, AXA Past President and Chair of the Accountability Task Force.

02:32:11.438 --> 02:32:19.686
I wish to note that our task force does encourage an active two-way dialogue between the administrators and the state board to help create viable solutions, and we do certainly welcome that.

02:32:20.266 --> 02:32:33.779
As with many of your members, we are still digesting details and have more questions and answers at this point, specifically questions on how this proposed regional structure would become operationalized and the timing for soliciting applications from interested counties that want to serve as regional leads.

02:32:34.220 --> 02:32:44.689
We are concerned what the role of the CCEE might be in supporting the regional leaders in those areas of the state where the counties themselves might need additional coaching and support in order to be able to serve the individual school districts.

02:32:45.370 --> 02:32:57.260
Since prior informational memos have indicated there are at least 180 school districts who would receive support under the LCFF, we believe it's important to consider specifically where the concentrations of most of these districts are.

02:32:57.721 --> 02:33:07.990
Unless there's a balanced representation of these districts being distributed across all regions of the state, it will be important to consider if there will be a proportionate number of regional leads according to where the districts of support are needed.

02:33:08.590 --> 02:33:20.776
It would be helpful for the field to receive additional information on potential roles and responsibilities of each of these entities that might be involved in providing support and assistance to schools and LEAs, such as the CDE and the CCEE.

02:33:21.216 --> 02:33:29.940
It's important to consider how the state agencies will work, coordinate, and collaborate with the county offices in order to leverage the state's limited capacity and appropriate use of limited resources.

02:33:30.580 --> 02:33:38.008
We appreciate that the assistance and support offered to the schools and LEAs will be customized and tailored to the unique needs and the potential challenges of our LEAs face.

02:33:38.409 --> 02:33:44.595
The differentiated instruction assistance, excuse me, and targeted support is critically important if we expect to close the achievement gaps.

02:33:45.632 --> 02:33:56.961
In prior past surveys for administrators, there has been an overwhelming support expressed for ongoing coaches for new and continuing administrators, a support network, and professional development for the new curriculum frameworks.

02:33:57.441 --> 02:34:05.027
Our members have also provided consistent feedback that they need assistance in forming leadership teams who will focus on student performance and data analysis.

02:34:05.428 --> 02:34:10.652
This is even more important now that we have the dashboard with multiple data points on the various state and local indicators.

02:34:11.132 --> 02:34:17.195
Administrators also believe that all decisions need to be made in collaboration with the school and district leadership and local stakeholders.

02:34:17.815 --> 02:34:29.140
As part of this integrated system support, AXA is particularly interested in ensuring the effective use and optimization of the optional 3% reservation of the Title II federal funds to develop the expertise and capacity of the school leaders.

02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:39.324
We know these funds translate to approximately $7 million statewide, and leveraging these funds for professional development, a cohort model, PLCs, and or job-alike networks should be considered.

02:34:40.184 --> 02:34:43.666
On one final note, I'd like to echo Member Burr's comments.

02:34:44.126 --> 02:34:48.909
I would say beware of the shades of SES in the PI days.

02:34:49.189 --> 02:34:53.171
Having lived through that, I can tell you it's awkward at best and it was a questionable solution.

02:34:53.771 --> 02:35:00.714
As always, AXA, individual administrators across the state, and our task force stand ready to engage in more extensive two-way discussions with you all.

02:35:00.994 --> 02:35:03.256
We encourage that and hope to see you at a future date.

02:35:03.316 --> 02:35:03.876
Thank you very much.

02:35:10.695 --> 02:35:13.016
Hello, Liz Guillen with Public Advocates.

02:35:15.416 --> 02:35:20.398
Continuous improvement is such a central part of the work of LCFF.

02:35:21.318 --> 02:35:26.640
And in order to make it work, we have to be further along.

02:35:27.100 --> 02:35:35.443
And it's disappointing that there is no real sense of urgency, at least that we have seen from the reading.

02:35:36.903 --> 02:35:39.644
We urge you to set a timeline.

02:35:41.121 --> 02:35:52.544
within the next two board meetings by November to ask staff to bring back a real actionable plan for how the system of support will be formed.

02:35:54.005 --> 02:36:06.729
Right now we have student leaders and parent organizers outside hoping to share the message that LCFF is working or that things are better than they were before.

02:36:07.685 --> 02:36:09.607
This is a critical piece of that.

02:36:10.308 --> 02:36:15.293
And we would really like to work with you, of course, to develop the system.

02:36:15.833 --> 02:36:28.025
But as you have been grappling with trying to figure out what the framework is and what's being proposed, we also have and we'd like to see it solidified more.

02:36:28.225 --> 02:36:28.606
Thank you.

02:36:33.496 --> 02:36:36.277
Good morning, Carrie Hennell with the Education Trust West.

02:36:37.918 --> 02:36:44.922
We'd like to associate my comments with Liz Gaines from Public Advocates and appreciate the discussion about the vagueness of the plan that's been proposed.

02:36:45.062 --> 02:36:49.664
We agree that it's awfully thin on details at this point and it's far too vague.

02:36:50.424 --> 02:36:59.569
While we appreciate and agree with the desire to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach, the problem at this point is that by refusing to lay out any firm commitments in the plan,

02:37:00.229 --> 02:37:09.276
you are inspiring very little confidence in the public that things will actually be improved and that the LCFF promise of equity and improvement will actually be realized.

02:37:10.136 --> 02:37:17.722
We also appreciate and acknowledge the description in the agenda item about the dashboard and how by itself it cannot

02:37:18.882 --> 02:37:22.445
facilitate continuous improvement at the local level, that we need additional local data.

02:37:23.265 --> 02:37:43.820
The lagging data, the multiple measures are fine for accountability, but in order for the continuous improvement to happen, would appreciate some discussion about how the state will provide access to further data, how it will support that local access to information and continuous improvement, and how it will ensure that this continuous improvement happens, and just that we hope that it will happen by empowering locals.

02:37:43.940 --> 02:37:44.220
Thank you.

02:37:49.926 --> 02:37:53.770
Hello, I'm Mary Perry and I'm here with the California State PTA.

02:37:54.772 --> 02:38:04.523
And as most of you know, we certainly know a lot about the diversity of this state and the importance of dealing with local needs.

02:38:05.177 --> 02:38:13.067
At the same time, we also know that it doesn't make sense for every single school and district in this state to reinvent the wheel.

02:38:13.548 --> 02:38:20.317
And this regional and cohesive system of support makes sense to perhaps thread that needle.

02:38:21.598 --> 02:38:38.314
I'd like to suggest that family engagement provides a very tangible topic within this system of support and maybe one that could be a pilot to move along the lines of immediacy that some of my colleagues have mentioned.

02:38:38.795 --> 02:38:42.638
The fact is there is research that clearly links

02:38:43.519 --> 02:38:56.709
Effective family engagement, when you engage families in the learning of their children to real school improvement, you're mobilizing your child's first teacher, and it can make all the difference.

02:38:57.530 --> 02:39:09.519
At the same time, we know that family engagement strategies are one of the missing pieces for school districts in our state.

02:39:15.322 --> 02:39:21.788
Good morning, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz representing the California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

02:39:22.449 --> 02:39:24.751
I have one comment and one recommendation.

02:39:25.541 --> 02:39:40.034
Any statewide system of support should have at every level personnel or staff that possess experience and expertise in addressing the educational needs of the students in every subgroup.

02:39:41.135 --> 02:39:44.538
In doing so, the support provided would be appropriate.

02:39:46.219 --> 02:39:58.425
and for these students, and hopefully result in identifying the tools, strategies that are most effective when dealing with the educational needs of these student subgroups.

02:39:59.066 --> 02:40:07.090
CABE has extensive experience in working with LEAs in providing support, and we stand ready to assist you in this effort.

02:40:07.450 --> 02:40:07.730
Thank you.

02:40:12.076 --> 02:40:14.940
Good morning, Shelly Spiegel Coleman with Californians Together.

02:40:15.100 --> 02:40:20.287
Some of you may not know that prior to my work with Californians Together, I worked for 27 years at the L.A.

02:40:20.327 --> 02:40:21.689
County Office of Education.

02:40:21.950 --> 02:40:23.612
I lived through Sate and Date.

02:40:24.273 --> 02:40:26.476
I drank Sate and Date, right?

02:40:29.158 --> 02:40:39.502
I really appreciate board member Rucker's unit of change, focusing on who the students are, because that was not the focus of what we did before.

02:40:40.222 --> 02:40:50.265
And so when we talk about who are going to be the providers and who are going to be the leads, we have to think about, we know who the students are going to be that these providers and leads need to provide help for.

02:40:50.905 --> 02:40:58.550
And so what providers have expertise in English learners that are in small numbers, in a small district in small numbers?

02:40:58.891 --> 02:41:06.756
What providers have expertise for English learners in a school district that have multiple languages and not a large group of a single language?

02:41:07.156 --> 02:41:15.864
What providers have expertise in a large urban district that has large numbers of English learners in one or two major languages?

02:41:16.465 --> 02:41:19.007
That's what we have to build into this system.

02:41:19.367 --> 02:41:23.431
We have to build expertise to be able to address those needs.

02:41:23.811 --> 02:41:25.813
And the unit of change is the students.

02:41:26.414 --> 02:41:26.754
Thank you.

02:41:31.391 --> 02:41:34.174
Hello, Lorraine Richards, California Teachers Association.

02:41:34.274 --> 02:41:48.287
In considering the development of the statewide system of support, CTA urges the board to ask, how will the developing statewide systems of support be accessible to local stakeholders who are not school administrators or board members?

02:41:48.868 --> 02:41:51.711
While we agree there should be no wrong door for LEAs,

02:41:52.171 --> 02:42:17.748
to enter to access resources or support available through the statewide system of support, we urge members to ask how the agencies responsible for providing support will, one, clearly and publicly identify the point of contact for accessing the system, and two, providing an open door to students, parents, educators, and community stakeholders such that the access is not appropriately restricted.

02:42:17.928 --> 02:42:18.188
Thank you.

02:42:22.608 --> 02:42:25.250
Morning, Terry Burns, California School Boards Association.

02:42:25.330 --> 02:42:28.031
First of all, associated remarks with those of AXA.

02:42:29.652 --> 02:42:33.595
We think that the regional system of support has, is very promising.

02:42:33.995 --> 02:42:46.723
We think it's important that there is consistency across providers with the concept that they go out and first start talking to the district, see what the district thinks the concerns are.

02:42:47.287 --> 02:42:49.250
and then work through problems in that regard.

02:42:49.811 --> 02:43:02.247
We also think it's important that it be a market-driven system that for whatever reason, bad interpersonal relationships between that county office and the district, whatever,

02:43:02.868 --> 02:43:09.174
that a district can look towards a regional provider that works for them.

02:43:11.055 --> 02:43:21.945
That way nobody gets stuck with an undue bill because they have to go to this provider and they can do the relationship stuff that is so important and plays on a one-to-one basis.

02:43:21.985 --> 02:43:22.906
So, thank you very much.

02:43:28.022 --> 02:43:39.045
Good morning, LeAngela Reid on behalf of AXA, excuse me, on behalf of SSDA want to, sorry Martha, I'd like to align myself with the comments of AXA and CSBA.

02:43:39.185 --> 02:43:39.845
Sorry about that.

02:43:40.806 --> 02:43:41.646
Martha's now awake.

02:43:43.426 --> 02:43:49.868
I just want to reiterate the point that I think that the first thing that has to happen is there needs to be two questions put to the field.

02:43:50.108 --> 02:43:52.509
One, what do you think you need to be successful?

02:43:53.129 --> 02:44:01.214
Because even if they don't know, it will give you, it will create an indication of what's thought, what, where they're, they're going as far as process.

02:44:01.435 --> 02:44:05.017
And then two, who do you go to for information resource?

02:44:05.157 --> 02:44:14.563
Everyone has someone locally identified that can, we can start there with those folks because they know the local history, the local battles, the local dynamics.

02:44:14.844 --> 02:44:18.586
When you send someone in, they are doing to, not doing with.

02:44:19.126 --> 02:44:22.409
And so it's important to, to start from local level and build out.

02:44:22.629 --> 02:44:22.909
Thank you.

02:44:27.634 --> 02:44:29.876
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

02:44:30.797 --> 02:44:38.663
I share Dr. Kirst's skepticism about relying on one exclusive type of agency to do this very complicated work.

02:44:39.324 --> 02:44:42.367
It's of particular concern for charter schools where

02:44:43.868 --> 02:44:53.314
We have very good relationships and working relationships with some county offices and some county leadership and extremely hostile relationships with others.

02:44:53.414 --> 02:44:57.497
So when I hear board member Burr say, hi, we're here from

02:44:58.777 --> 02:45:09.679
the county office and we're here to help, I actually work with charter schools where we have, hi, I'm here from the county office and I hate your school and I hate charter schools and we want to see you shut down.

02:45:10.179 --> 02:45:20.021
And so the notion of relying on those agencies to provide this kind of support in some regions would be deeply troubling and we would encourage you to think twice.

02:45:20.421 --> 02:45:23.542
Upping the periscope a bit, there's a lot of talk here about instructional

02:45:24.242 --> 02:45:25.543
assistance and that sort of thing.

02:45:25.883 --> 02:45:43.728
My experience from the Satan date stuff was that a lot of these problems stemmed from inept governance, inept leadership, very poor labor management relationships, and much of the failure of that, of the date stuff, was to focus on instruction when the fundamentals underneath instruction were very unsound.

02:45:43.948 --> 02:45:45.569
And just keep that in mind.

02:45:45.589 --> 02:45:45.849
Thank you.

02:45:50.054 --> 02:45:52.015
Good morning, my name is Jeff Mercado from CCESA.

02:45:53.336 --> 02:45:55.637
As we know, the counties will play a central role in this system.

02:45:55.657 --> 02:46:09.604
We look forward to that and all 58 counties are committed to really improving capacity and be able to work to move forward with state agencies, state boards, CDE, CCE to work in collaboration to really develop the system and get feedback from the field.

02:46:10.365 --> 02:46:12.846
A couple of things to point out over the past year, the counties

02:46:13.326 --> 02:46:19.092
took the role of being that first line of support for the dashboard and the revised LCAP template very seriously.

02:46:19.112 --> 02:46:27.880
We came together, worked closely with our partners to then develop four comprehensive trainings to have all 58 counties spun up and ready to go to then turn around to the field and be ready

02:46:28.660 --> 02:46:32.003
In that vein, we have the MTSS work being done by Orange County and Butte.

02:46:32.324 --> 02:46:40.451
And we're also entering a partnership with the Carnegie Foundation and the Improvement Collective to really build up the capacity of county offices around improvement science.

02:46:40.471 --> 02:46:44.114
And we're looking forward to doing that work with the CCE and the state board staff and the CDE as well.

02:46:44.514 --> 02:46:54.222
So we look forward to really doing this work with LEAs, not to with in partnership and to really build our capacity to help facilitate the discussions to really impact student outcomes.

02:46:54.503 --> 02:46:54.743
Thank you.

02:46:57.108 --> 02:46:59.229
Okay, that concludes the public comment.

02:46:59.249 --> 02:47:03.291
This was an information item for this meeting, not an action item.

02:47:03.371 --> 02:47:07.754
So I think we'll take another break and then go on to number three.

02:47:07.834 --> 02:47:10.415
So let's reconvene at 20 of 12.

02:47:11.615 --> 02:47:15.678
Board members, we're going to have the lunch and you go get it and so on.

02:47:15.778 --> 02:47:22.081
So this will be the break and then lunch you can have when you want it.

02:47:22.961 --> 02:47:28.803
There's also cupcakes in here in Olivia's honor.

02:47:29.184 --> 02:47:38.867
And we didn't have a cake, but we had cupcakes.

02:47:43.389 --> 02:47:45.350
Okay, the State Board will reconvene.

02:47:45.530 --> 02:47:47.010
Please take your seats.

02:47:53.934 --> 02:48:02.744
We're now ready for item three, which is the update on the Every Student Succeeds Act, Federal Act.

02:48:05.427 --> 02:48:10.553
And before we take up the item, the State Superintendent wants to make an addendum to the last item.

02:48:11.695 --> 02:48:12.576
Thank you, President Kirsch.

02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:21.364
And appreciate again the rich debate and the necessary questioning of different details we need to develop.

02:48:21.404 --> 02:48:26.547
So talking to my staff during the break and talking to President Kirst and Karen, we'll work very closely together.

02:48:26.587 --> 02:48:28.108
We have to date on this.

02:48:28.248 --> 02:48:29.549
We need to get more details.

02:48:29.629 --> 02:48:41.296
We invite board members to channel their information and questions through Karen and we'll again stand ready to report back at the next meeting to get some progress report and

02:48:41.936 --> 02:48:48.419
I think November, aiming to November for a more comprehensive full report that would be ready to act on.

02:48:48.939 --> 02:48:52.081
So with that, just wanted to say appreciate the good debate.

02:48:54.173 --> 02:49:05.979
Okay, before we're ready for item three, I want to make a comment on the perspective the board has been using in looking at the various suggestions we've been getting with respect to ESSA.

02:49:06.199 --> 02:49:13.503
And that is that we have our own specific state statute concerning school accountability, the LCFF.

02:49:15.280 --> 02:49:24.046
And this was enacted, the LCFF, in 2013 before ESSA was even a proposal under consideration in Congress.

02:49:25.688 --> 02:49:35.475
For this reason, we have been consistent in emphasizing that state policy should be the foundation of our deliberations around ESSA.

02:49:36.776 --> 02:49:39.238
And I want to underscore what I've said before.

02:49:39.678 --> 02:49:43.041
The state plan is essentially a contract with a federal government.

02:49:45.222 --> 02:49:51.104
We have approached this as not spelling out unnecessary detail in the plan for several reasons.

02:49:52.564 --> 02:49:58.706
First, there is lots of detail in the state law that we've been implementing for several years that sets the framework.

02:49:59.906 --> 02:50:11.309
Second, the more details we include in ESSA, the less flexibility that we have to adjust what's working and what isn't based on local feedback and what the data show.

02:50:12.369 --> 02:50:27.625
For everything spelled out in detail, we would need the federal government's permission to adjust rather than being able to respond to stakeholder feedback as we have in the past in revising the ELICAP and the dashboard.

02:50:28.792 --> 02:50:38.074
I would remind people that this state operated under the No Child Left Behind law from year 2003 until 2017-18.

02:50:38.414 --> 02:50:40.454
That's a long time.

02:50:40.514 --> 02:50:48.836
You may or may not like this administration, but there'll probably be another administration in the future.

02:50:48.916 --> 02:50:55.277
So holding this as a contract with the federal government

02:50:56.157 --> 02:51:00.718
I think is a plunge into the unknown as to who you're going to be dealing with back there.

02:51:01.538 --> 02:51:15.201
So, we would, I understand that stakeholders would like to see more details in this plan, but it is not a vehicle to create new law or regulations that bind the state of California.

02:51:15.801 --> 02:51:24.763
We want to respond to the prompts and the Secretary of Education will tell us if our responses are not detailed enough and we haven't answered fully their questions.

02:51:26.147 --> 02:51:38.881
Finally, a lack of specific detail in the plan does not mean that we will not flesh out the detail as we move forward implementing these programs under our state laws and our state policymaking system.

02:51:39.827 --> 02:52:01.164
Describing this general approach I have done, I hope, allows us to implement a program in a matter that is maximally responsible to the needs identified at the state and local level and also compatible with the Secretary's of Education's need to enforce the ESSA law.

02:52:01.825 --> 02:52:03.666
So, with that as an overview,

02:52:04.807 --> 02:52:11.849
We will hear first from Barbara Murchison and other CDE staff on specific topics.

02:52:13.930 --> 02:52:24.674
We'll go through the round of CDE presentations and then we'll take initial SBE member questions and comments.

02:52:25.334 --> 02:52:32.456
Then we'll move to public comment and then we'll move back to SBE discussion and comments among the members.

02:52:32.917 --> 02:52:34.297
So Barbara, thank you for coming.

02:52:37.120 --> 02:52:38.001
Thank you for having me.

02:52:40.123 --> 02:52:42.985
Good morning President Kerr, Superintendent Torlakson, board members.

02:52:43.125 --> 02:52:46.348
I'm Barbara Murchison as a state lead here at the Department of Education.

02:52:46.929 --> 02:52:54.475
The purpose of this item is to provide you and the public with an update regarding progress in the development of the Every Student Succeeds Act or ESSA state plan.

02:52:55.596 --> 02:53:01.425
The CDE recommends today that the Board approve the revisions to the ESSA State Plan proposed in Attachment 1.

02:53:02.186 --> 02:53:06.613
The CDE will bring a final draft of the State Plan to the Board for approval in September 2017.

02:53:11.488 --> 02:53:16.109
So recall at the January meeting you approved the set of guiding principles on this slide.

02:53:16.869 --> 02:53:31.913
The principles state that our plan will support the creation of a single coherent local state and federal accountability and continuous improvement system with state priorities and direction leading and opportunities in the ESSA leveraged to assist in accomplishing state goals and objectives.

02:53:33.035 --> 02:53:52.032
The principles also reflect our commitment to updating federally required applications and plans, to reinforce and align with state priorities, and to use ESSA resources to support the implementation of rigorous standards and the principles of equity, local control, and continuous improvement that drive our LCFF-based system.

02:53:53.968 --> 02:54:06.058
Plan development has been driven by these principles and it's great that with today's conversations, we're getting much closer to the realization of the single coherent system that we've all been talking about since ESSA became law.

02:54:09.821 --> 02:54:17.888
Our goal today is to get as close to the final draft as possible so that we have minimal changes when we bring the plan to you for approval in September.

02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:20.661
Here's our current timeline.

02:54:21.382 --> 02:54:24.165
You'll note that there are no asterisks on this slide.

02:54:24.185 --> 02:54:27.067
I've worn out that button on the keyboard.

02:54:28.729 --> 02:54:42.743
We intend to submit the plan to the US Department of Education on September 18th, and we'll be bringing it to you for approval at your September meeting, which is currently scheduled for September 13th and 14th, just a few days before the submission date.

02:54:43.965 --> 02:54:54.254
Also, statute requires that the governor have 30 days to review the plan before it is submitted, and it is our understanding that that plan should be the plan that is being submitted to ED.

02:54:55.675 --> 02:55:04.703
And we also want to make sure that all of the stakeholders who have worked alongside us to develop the plan have ample time to review the document before your September meeting.

02:55:06.260 --> 02:55:12.267
For all of these reasons, we intend to take your direction today and use it to develop a new draft plan.

02:55:12.968 --> 02:55:26.043
We will make this new draft, which we hope will be pretty close to the final draft, you can see I'm still a little wary of saying final, but close to the final draft, available to you and the public as an information memoranda in early August.

02:55:27.915 --> 02:55:32.443
We do have another meeting with the California Practitioners Advisory Group, or CPAG, next month.

02:55:33.004 --> 02:55:37.511
And during that meeting, they'll be able to weigh in on any outstanding ESSA-related issues.

02:55:38.252 --> 02:55:41.538
But again, we are aiming to get close to final today.

02:55:46.167 --> 02:55:54.355
Since ESSA became law, we've discussed ESSA state plan development at eight of your meetings and at eight CPAG meetings, one meeting per month since April 2016.

02:55:56.498 --> 02:56:01.182
In addition to all of these meetings, we've conducted four formal phases of stakeholder engagement.

02:56:02.188 --> 02:56:13.441
In spring of 2016, we conducted phase one, where we partnered with county offices of education and our colleagues at the California Comprehensive Center to conduct webinars and statewide regional meetings.

02:56:14.302 --> 02:56:19.527
We asked Californians what they wanted for their schools and how best to support students and teachers.

02:56:20.328 --> 02:56:23.492
We also used a survey to collect feedback more widely.

02:56:24.963 --> 02:56:35.626
For Phase 2, last November, we made available several sections of the draft plan in a toolkit, including videos and a survey, and asked the public to share their feedback on those sections.

02:56:36.907 --> 02:56:42.789
In Phase 3, in February, we once again collaborated with county offices to hold regional meetings.

02:56:43.509 --> 02:56:49.631
During these meetings, we asked the public to provide feedback on specific policy questions to help inform your decision-making.

02:56:50.836 --> 02:57:01.811
More information and links to the reports for each of these phases of stakeholder engagement is available on our webpage and the link is provided on this slide.

02:57:05.036 --> 02:57:06.458
Which brings us to phase four.

02:57:07.719 --> 02:57:15.582
Since we saw you in May, we've been very busy conducting phase four of SSA stakeholder engagement, which included the 30-day public comment period.

02:57:16.582 --> 02:57:22.684
We brought the plan to the CPAG, and members spent more than four hours providing feedback on each section of the plan.

02:57:23.504 --> 02:57:27.946
CPAG feedback is provided in attachment one and helped inform our proposed revisions.

02:57:29.106 --> 02:57:34.908
We deployed a variety of engagement strategies during phase four, building upon the successes of phases one, two, and three.

02:57:36.414 --> 02:57:39.035
Key to phase four was the expansion of our partnerships.

02:57:39.856 --> 02:57:45.578
We've worked closely with our county office colleagues since the beginning, and they have continued to be steadfast in their support.

02:57:46.399 --> 02:57:52.141
A good example, you recall at the May meeting, President Kurz suggested that we might want to have a regional meeting in the Bay Area.

02:57:52.782 --> 02:58:03.907
And a few minutes after that discussion, when we broke for lunch, I went back up to my desk, and there were two emails in my inbox from Bay Area county office staff volunteering to help us out and partner with us.

02:58:04.807 --> 02:58:07.230
It's that kind of support that makes this work possible.

02:58:07.770 --> 02:58:15.258
So thanks again to all of the county office staff, too many to name here, who have partnered with us throughout our plan development journey.

02:58:16.239 --> 02:58:23.167
For phase four, we expanded our partnerships to include work with professional associations and the LCFF equity coalition.

02:58:23.871 --> 02:58:27.235
This expanded our audience to include specific groups of stakeholders.

02:58:28.176 --> 02:58:35.904
We also built a toolkit of resources to make it easier for stakeholders across the state to understand and provide feedback on the state plan.

02:58:40.020 --> 02:58:42.942
So this slide shows the meetings we conducted during Phase 4.

02:58:43.863 --> 02:58:46.705
As you can see, we held 11 in-person meetings.

02:58:47.346 --> 02:58:53.451
Two of these meetings were hosted by our LCFF Equity Coalition colleagues with support from the California Endowment.

02:58:54.331 --> 02:58:59.576
Participants at these two meetings were primarily parents, and it was a privilege to hear their perspectives.

02:59:00.336 --> 02:59:04.419
We very much appreciate our Equity Coalition colleagues for making these meetings happen.

02:59:05.663 --> 02:59:11.767
We heard from people in earlier phases that it was challenging for teachers and parents to get to meetings during the day.

02:59:12.268 --> 02:59:17.351
So this time, we hosted meetings in the evening as well as the day meetings.

02:59:17.912 --> 02:59:29.880
Our colleagues at the Sacramento, San Diego, and Los Angeles county offices got a double dose of Essa and Barb, hosting both morning and evening meetings at their county offices.

02:59:33.476 --> 02:59:45.665
We also hosted three webinars, one in collaboration with the Small School Districts Association, and another with the Association of California School Administrators, or ACSA, and the California School Boards Association, CSBA.

02:59:46.906 --> 02:59:58.094
These were great opportunities to hear the perspectives of specific groups of stakeholders, and we appreciate these organizations for co-hosting these online meetings and getting their members engaged in providing feedback.

03:00:02.236 --> 03:00:05.217
At the center of phase four was the public comment toolkit.

03:00:06.517 --> 03:00:18.661
We know we can't be everywhere, and during phase one, folks explicitly told us that it would be helpful to have a set of resources so that they could hold stakeholder meetings at a time that was convenient for them and their local communities.

03:00:19.681 --> 03:00:28.864
Also, there is so much material to cover in the plan that we were typically able to cover only three sections during one of our two-hour meetings.

03:00:29.400 --> 03:00:35.785
The toolkit was designed to support people to learn more about and provide feedback on whichever sections of the plan were of interest to them.

03:00:37.266 --> 03:00:43.791
It's hard to see on this screenshot, but what we have is a web page where we've broken the plan out into 11 separate sections.

03:00:44.371 --> 03:00:53.899
And for each section, there is a short narrated PowerPoint video, a short two to four page plan section summary, which presents the plan content.

03:00:53.939 --> 03:00:58.142
And again, it's a relatively technical document, into more user friendly language.

03:00:59.105 --> 03:01:03.009
and that same plan summary document translated into Spanish.

03:01:04.430 --> 03:01:12.397
The toolkit also has facilitator instructions, the PowerPoint that we used across the state, and most important, the link to the public comment survey.

03:01:16.121 --> 03:01:24.769
So we made available the introduction as well to make the 11 sections, but here are the 10 sections for which we asked folks to provide feedback.

03:01:29.778 --> 03:01:32.559
And here is the question we asked for each section.

03:01:32.579 --> 03:01:34.860
It's the same question for each section.

03:01:35.860 --> 03:01:43.643
The question was designed to be accessible to all types of stakeholders and to get at the question of equity that was discussed during your May meeting.

03:01:44.143 --> 03:01:56.607
So for each section of the plan, we asked folks in the survey, please share your ideas about how this section of the ESSA state plan could be improved to promote equity and support your students and schools.

03:01:57.127 --> 03:01:58.368
We wanted to take that question.

03:01:59.028 --> 03:01:59.748
out to the field.

03:02:03.190 --> 03:02:06.091
So here's a little bit of overview information for phase four.

03:02:06.111 --> 03:02:17.477
We were a little bit worried that with the timing, school getting out, the beginning of summer, all kinds of graduation, May 22 to June 30 is not necessarily the best time to engage folks.

03:02:18.197 --> 03:02:23.319
So we were really happy to see that we got some pretty good numbers in terms of who had responded.

03:02:23.880 --> 03:02:24.680
We had 466 folks.

03:02:26.741 --> 03:02:28.122
who responded to the survey.

03:02:28.823 --> 03:02:32.546
More than 600 people participated in our regional and online meetings.

03:02:33.367 --> 03:02:37.731
And we received more than 100 letters and emails around the as a state plan.

03:02:38.451 --> 03:02:45.958
And you'll see in your addendum attachment four, there's a breakdown of which types of stakeholders were engaged.

03:02:49.284 --> 03:02:55.430
An analysis of the feedback collected from the CPAG and during Phase 4 meetings was provided in Attachment 1.

03:02:55.631 --> 03:03:06.902
And an analysis of all the feedback collected during Phase 4, which includes all of the survey responses and all the correspondence we received, was provided in Attachment 4.

03:03:11.061 --> 03:03:17.943
So attachment four, which is the summary report for phase four of SS stakeholder engagement, was just completed yesterday.

03:03:17.963 --> 03:03:29.826
And I do apologize for that less than optimal timing, but typically staff takes a month or two to read, analyze, and summarize SS stakeholder feedback after one of these phases of engagement.

03:03:30.887 --> 03:03:37.909
I really need to take a minute to acknowledge the work of my colleagues in program offices across the department who sorted through

03:03:39.161 --> 03:03:43.204
The 700 or so pages, I don't know if you've seen it yet.

03:03:43.244 --> 03:03:44.264
There's one in the lobby.

03:03:44.344 --> 03:03:45.425
I think there's one here.

03:03:45.845 --> 03:03:48.347
There's one up in the board office.

03:03:48.887 --> 03:03:52.350
We've collected more than about 700 pages of raw comments.

03:03:55.243 --> 03:04:00.385
within a week, and a week that included the 4th of July, no less, right?

03:04:00.445 --> 03:04:11.649
So folks have been working really, really furiously to pull all this information together so you would have the benefit of all of this phase four stakeholder feedback to inform your decision making today.

03:04:13.479 --> 03:04:20.321
But still, because I know that most folks haven't really had the time to review Attachment 4, I want to take a few minutes to go through some of the highlights.

03:04:21.181 --> 03:04:32.144
Remember, Attachment 1, which was posted on June 30th, included an analysis of feedback from the CPAG and feedback from the 14 meetings, which represented hundreds of people.

03:04:32.884 --> 03:04:38.005
Attachment 4 builds upon Attachment 1 to include the survey results and correspondence.

03:04:40.239 --> 03:04:45.561
It's important to note that not all sections of the plan receive the same amount of attention during the meetings.

03:04:46.485 --> 03:04:57.191
When people registered for the meetings, we asked them to indicate which three topics they were most interested in, and then we discussed the most frequently requested topics at those meetings.

03:04:57.812 --> 03:05:05.577
So some of the topics were discussed at every meeting, and some of the topics were not chosen to be discussed at any of them.

03:05:05.717 --> 03:05:08.598
So we had different amounts of feedback on each one of these items.

03:05:09.659 --> 03:05:15.923
Assessment, accountability, and school support and improvement are topics that received a lot of feedback during the meetings.

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:24.207
And the feedback received later in the public comment process was not substantively different than the feedback received earlier.

03:05:25.028 --> 03:05:33.035
So as you can see on this slide, staff does not propose additional revisions beyond those in attachment one for these three topics.

03:05:34.156 --> 03:05:38.000
Deputy Carrick-Ashley will be here to discuss these sections with you in a bit.

03:05:39.983 --> 03:05:49.890
The next few sections on the slide were discussed by the CPAG, but not discussed at any of the 14 meetings, so there is more new information in the survey results and correspondence.

03:05:51.107 --> 03:06:01.274
For access to educators, staff proposes to provide more clarity in the California Terms and Definitions table in the plan, especially for intern, misassigned, and out-of-field teachers.

03:06:01.455 --> 03:06:06.338
We've heard from folks that there's some confusion about that and some concern about that.

03:06:06.358 --> 03:06:10.101
So we want to go back and take a closer look at that and provide clarifications.

03:06:11.274 --> 03:06:18.358
For school conditions, we propose to further expand the language in Attachment 1 to be more clear about specific supports.

03:06:19.279 --> 03:06:25.623
For school transitions, we propose to add more information about supporting the transition from early education to the K-12 system.

03:06:26.909 --> 03:06:41.479
to change K-12 to P-12, wherever appropriate in the plan, to reference the role of the LCAP addendum in articulating transitions, and to revise the section to reflect recent policy changes in two of the higher education systems.

03:06:41.639 --> 03:06:47.443
I had the pleasure of presenting to the Intersegmental Coordinating Committee, and I shared this section of the plan with them.

03:06:47.463 --> 03:06:49.545
And they're like, oh, but we don't do that anymore.

03:06:50.385 --> 03:06:57.110
So I was really glad to be able to talk to them so we can make sure that our plan reflects most current policies with our other segments.

03:07:01.934 --> 03:07:07.859
We're not proposing any additional changes to Title I, Part C, Education of Migratory Children Beyond Attachment 1.

03:07:08.940 --> 03:07:18.787
For Title I, Part D, we propose to make the purpose of the program more clear, because there's been some question about that, and to reference the alternative accountability indicators and tools.

03:07:19.813 --> 03:07:27.025
For Title II, Part A, we propose to add more clarity around specific types of professional learning and the need to address the teacher shortage.

03:07:27.987 --> 03:07:33.056
Deputy Tom Adams will be here in a bit to talk more about all of the proposed revisions to this section.

03:07:34.520 --> 03:07:41.346
For Title III, we propose to add new language about guidance, tools, and toolkits to support English learners.

03:07:42.587 --> 03:07:48.231
And we don't propose any additional revisions beyond what's in Attachment 1 for the remaining sections of the plan.

03:07:48.291 --> 03:07:56.398
So again, we do apologize that you weren't able to get the complete report earlier, but we're happy that you have the complete report now.

03:08:00.908 --> 03:08:09.213
So moving back to Attachment 1, where most of the proposed revisions reside, we really have three types of revisions, three things we really need to accomplish.

03:08:09.833 --> 03:08:18.558
First, many of those proposed revisions are in response to stakeholder feedback, but within the policy framework that you established earlier this year.

03:08:19.358 --> 03:08:30.825
We heard you very clearly when you directed us to write the plan at a relatively high level, affording the state maximum flexibility to design programs and activities that are aligned with our LCFF-based system.

03:08:31.606 --> 03:08:44.234
As President Kerr stated at the outset of this item, this is fundamentally an application for federal funds, a contract, and it does not serve us well to get way into the weeds with the United States Department of Education.

03:08:45.874 --> 03:08:55.816
Second, we want to take your direction coming out of today's conversations regarding accountability and school support and improvement and integrate them into the next draft as appropriate.

03:08:56.956 --> 03:09:04.698
And finally, we need to revisit the state plan peer review criteria and make sure that the plan meets those criteria to the greatest extent possible.

03:09:06.898 --> 03:09:13.860
Back in March, at the same time that the new template was made available, ED issued peer review criteria for Title 1A,

03:09:15.916 --> 03:09:19.577
Title III Part A, and the McKinney-Vento sections of the plan.

03:09:20.717 --> 03:09:29.000
Now that ED has returned plans to the states that submitted their plans early, we have a better idea about how they're using that peer review criteria.

03:09:29.500 --> 03:09:34.141
And we've also been able to speak with a couple of peer reviewers to learn from their experiences.

03:09:35.302 --> 03:09:39.723
What we've heard is that peer reviewers have been directed to look for completeness.

03:09:41.172 --> 03:09:44.433
There is no partial credit for incomplete answers.

03:09:45.013 --> 03:09:45.894
It's just binary.

03:09:46.754 --> 03:09:52.056
And there is no additional credit for providing detail above and beyond what is required.

03:09:53.296 --> 03:09:56.418
One reviewer suggested that we treat the plan like a deposition.

03:09:57.238 --> 03:10:02.700
Answer the question completely, but once you've answered, stop talking.

03:10:05.797 --> 03:10:11.532
So let's look a little bit at how aligning our current draft to the Bureau review criteria might work.

03:10:15.160 --> 03:10:21.265
So here are a couple, and I apologize, that's not easy to read, but that's a long one that provides a really good example.

03:10:21.586 --> 03:10:27.350
Here are a couple of the peer review criteria for the accountability section of the plan, Title I-A of accountability, and I'll read them.

03:10:27.791 --> 03:10:38.420
Does the SEA describe the academic achievement indicator used in its statewide accountability system, including that the SEA uses the same indicator for all schools and all LEAs across the state?

03:10:40.083 --> 03:10:42.586
Yeah, our current draft does do that.

03:10:42.646 --> 03:10:43.508
It's pretty explicit.

03:10:43.548 --> 03:10:47.573
These are our indicators, and this is how we're going to use them.

03:10:48.214 --> 03:10:51.298
Then we get to the one right after that, which you can see is much more lengthy.

03:10:51.318 --> 03:10:54.402
I won't read the whole thing because there are a lot of ifs as opposed to shalls.

03:10:55.103 --> 03:11:11.537
But it says, does the description include how the SEA calculates the indicator, including that the calculation is consistent for all schools in all LEAs across the state, a description of the weighting of reading language arts achievement relative to math achievement, and then the rest are ifs, so I'm going to stop.

03:11:14.244 --> 03:11:18.086
This calculation requirement isn't in the plan template.

03:11:18.527 --> 03:11:29.253
So our current draft of the plan, it's likely to be in the section of law, but this section of the plan does not clearly say, describe how we calculate.

03:11:30.114 --> 03:11:33.296
We can, we clearly calculate it, and we will.

03:11:33.636 --> 03:11:37.839
But this is an example of how we go in, how we'll need to go back in and revisit

03:11:38.956 --> 03:11:48.978
these peer review criteria more closely to make sure that we are addressing exactly what ED would like to see from us and be as complete as possible with that.

03:11:51.271 --> 03:11:53.593
Here are a couple more for school conditions.

03:11:54.554 --> 03:12:01.839
Does the SEA describe how it will support LEAs receiving assistance under Title I Part A to improve school conditions for student learning?

03:12:02.480 --> 03:12:13.569
Our current draft does talk a lot about our LCFF-based system and how we're very interested in school climate and how school conditions are something that is just a big piece of our LCFF-based system.

03:12:14.229 --> 03:12:21.534
But when we get to the second one, does the SEA's description include how it will support LEAs to reduce incidences of bullying and harassment?

03:12:22.294 --> 03:12:26.817
The current draft doesn't have that answer to that specific question.

03:12:27.438 --> 03:12:36.364
So this would be another example where we would take a look at the peer review criteria and build it out to just very specifically say, this is how we are doing this.

03:12:39.528 --> 03:12:48.452
So that's what we mean when we propose to align the Title I Part A, Title III Part A, and McKinney-Vento sections of the plan more closely to the peer review criteria.

03:12:49.092 --> 03:12:52.313
We don't anticipate that it will result in substantive changes.

03:12:52.953 --> 03:12:59.416
In fact, it is likely to help us to adhere to the meet not exceed policy that you all have put forth.

03:13:02.758 --> 03:13:05.261
Down at the bottom of the slide, you can see it because I think people have.

03:13:05.621 --> 03:13:10.425
We looked at the peer review criteria in March and we started crafting our plan based on that.

03:13:10.445 --> 03:13:16.130
But clearly, these sections of the plan, like our Title I sections, have undergone many revisions since then.

03:13:16.191 --> 03:13:18.393
So it's just a good time to go back, revisit.

03:13:19.053 --> 03:13:21.694
and make sure that we're meeting those expectations.

03:13:22.154 --> 03:13:26.236
So, for folks who have more questions about the peer review criteria, they are available.

03:13:26.276 --> 03:13:33.840
There's a link to them on our CDESO webpage, and there's the direct link provided on this slide.

03:13:37.141 --> 03:13:39.202
So, here's our recommendation for today.

03:13:40.573 --> 03:13:48.795
We're going to need to amend the motion to account for the proposed revisions in attachment four, but we can do that when we get closer to the end of the item.

03:13:48.995 --> 03:13:52.556
And again, those are relatively minor revisions, but we want to make sure to do this properly.

03:13:53.476 --> 03:13:58.537
We're recommending that the board approve the revisions to the ESSA state plan proposed in attachment one.

03:14:03.799 --> 03:14:04.819
So I have some good news.

03:14:05.996 --> 03:14:14.648
After reviewing the public comment, staff has determined that the plan sections on this slide need only relatively minor revisions.

03:14:15.949 --> 03:14:23.399
Most of these sections did not receive a whole lot of public comment, indicating that most Californians are comfortable with the drafts.

03:14:24.551 --> 03:14:30.935
Given their relative completeness, we have not prepared presentations for the topics on this slide today.

03:14:31.716 --> 03:14:42.823
To be clear, although we're not going to be presenting on these sections, we will be asking you to approve the revisions for these planned sections as described in attachments one and four.

03:14:45.493 --> 03:14:52.257
Staff is here if you have any questions or want to discuss the proposed revisions for any of these sections.

03:14:53.077 --> 03:14:55.938
So we're not going to be talking about these much today.

03:14:56.059 --> 03:15:01.741
We're going to focus on the ones that have gotten a lot of public comment and where we have made some significant advances.

03:15:02.382 --> 03:15:10.506
But staff is here ready to provide additional information as needed so we can get these sections updated as well.

03:15:13.854 --> 03:15:18.657
We've prepared presentations for the planned sections on this slide.

03:15:20.018 --> 03:15:27.462
The first five topics have received a lot of public comment and there's been progress made on several fronts that we want to discuss with you.

03:15:28.643 --> 03:15:33.946
Carrick will present the first three topics on the slide and Tom Adams will follow with the next two.

03:15:35.475 --> 03:15:41.219
Title IV, Part A, the Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants, did not receive a lot of public comment.

03:15:41.359 --> 03:15:45.741
But there are some relatively new developments with this program that we want to discuss with you.

03:15:46.502 --> 03:15:50.824
And Chief Deputy Glenn Price will be here to share that part of the presentation.

03:15:53.106 --> 03:16:02.792
So with that, I'll invite Carrick up to start talking about assessment, try and move some of my

03:16:04.872 --> 03:16:06.075
I'll leave that one in case you need it.

03:16:08.321 --> 03:16:08.923
Good afternoon.

03:16:09.003 --> 03:16:13.775
Carrick Ashley, Deputy Superintendent, Performance Planning and Technology Branch.

03:16:15.037 --> 03:16:20.420
So assessment, this won't be, this section won't be a long presentation.

03:16:21.260 --> 03:16:28.464
Assessment was one of those sections of the ESSA state plan, draft plan that, you know, was fairly well defined already.

03:16:29.084 --> 03:16:38.489
But you may remember from our May discussion, we did have a discussion over a native language assessment, which we'll address here in the next slide.

03:16:39.329 --> 03:16:43.252
But as far as stakeholder feedback, we received over 300 comments.

03:16:43.813 --> 03:16:50.798
The respondents included different people, teachers, principals, administrators, professionals, and so forth.

03:16:51.879 --> 03:17:00.446
The public comment pretty much mirrored what we also heard from our CPAG, our advisory group.

03:17:00.987 --> 03:17:08.513
Some of these comments included support for expansion of CASP to be more reflective of the full breadth of curriculum.

03:17:09.755 --> 03:17:28.573
The comments include a lot of comments on the California Spanish Assessment or CSA, support for using that assessment in accountability, discussion about the eligibility requirements for who would take the assessment, the purpose of the assessment, and whether students would take both CSA and Smarter Balanced.

03:17:28.593 --> 03:17:33.378
Those were all comments that came in through the public feedback process.

03:17:35.034 --> 03:17:38.697
Most comments were consistent with CPAC comments.

03:17:40.038 --> 03:17:49.886
So taking all of those comments, both from our discussions with CPAC and our discussions with stakeholder feedback, we're going to revise the plan.

03:17:49.926 --> 03:17:52.328
The proposal is to revise the plan with this paragraph.

03:17:53.269 --> 03:17:59.091
It's actually a sentence, just a very long one, here that's on the slide that I'll go ahead and read.

03:17:59.151 --> 03:18:15.496
California will engage in conversations with stakeholders and experts in the field of language acquisition, measurement, and accountability over the course of developing the CSA with the goal of obtaining direction from the state board regarding the use of a valid and reliable CSA in accountability.

03:18:17.376 --> 03:18:22.538
So that's the full extent of the proposed revisions in the assessment section.

03:18:24.622 --> 03:18:26.885
We can come back and take questions later.

03:18:27.145 --> 03:18:39.161
The other section or the second section that we're going to talk about, we've skipped over accountability in the list and we're going to school support because again, we just had a separate board item on the system of support.

03:18:39.682 --> 03:18:47.645
But that stakeholder feedback, as you will see, talked about more information about the roles of CCEE and county offices.

03:18:48.045 --> 03:18:51.706
I think we had this discussion at the last item that we just went on.

03:18:52.326 --> 03:19:00.169
A focus on needs assessment and root causes, root cause analysis, which is also something that you as a board discussed in the last item.

03:19:01.260 --> 03:19:08.563
creating a coordinated system that is responsible, again, to local needs and resources, something, again, that we discussed.

03:19:08.623 --> 03:19:11.604
It's like we wrote the slide after item two.

03:19:12.745 --> 03:19:17.807
And then, of course, addressing the timeline for the evaluation and the exit of improvement status.

03:19:17.967 --> 03:19:21.048
All of those things were discussed in the last item.

03:19:23.409 --> 03:19:26.470
And there's no proposed revision to that section at this time.

03:19:27.871 --> 03:19:28.491
Accountability.

03:19:29.298 --> 03:19:29.918
We need your help.

03:19:30.979 --> 03:19:33.360
We still have some decisions to make on accountability.

03:19:34.481 --> 03:19:42.465
And so this will take up most of the presentation in terms of the sections that I'm presenting to you this afternoon.

03:19:42.926 --> 03:19:53.792
I just want to make a couple of comments before we get to the actual slide here of identifying the lowest performing 5% of schools, Title I schools, which is required by ESSA.

03:19:54.232 --> 03:19:55.673
And that is just to

03:19:56.613 --> 03:20:01.415
acknowledge some of the things that have brought us here to this point.

03:20:02.116 --> 03:20:09.759
One, a commitment by this board to make this a thoughtful, deliberate process in developing a system of accountability.

03:20:10.300 --> 03:20:14.602
A commitment to giving stakeholders multiple opportunities

03:20:15.202 --> 03:20:26.908
through that deliberate and thoughtful process to have comments into that system, including groups like our CPAG group and our technical design group.

03:20:27.628 --> 03:20:31.850
A commitment that this system is going to be state driven and not federal driven.

03:20:32.871 --> 03:20:36.793
A commitment to having a single integrated accountability and support system.

03:20:37.842 --> 03:20:44.887
You've made a commitment also to the continuous improvement process by designing a system that does both status and growth.

03:20:45.947 --> 03:20:55.093
And finally, a commitment to a system that believes that all schools can improve, all districts can improve and should improve.

03:20:55.453 --> 03:20:59.256
with a specific intention of narrowing achievement gaps.

03:21:00.457 --> 03:21:11.184
So as we talk about, even as we talked in the last item about systems of support, that's about providing resources to a select group of LEAs.

03:21:11.444 --> 03:21:18.409
But this system, as we've talked about it, is designed to address every school, to address every district, because everyone can get better.

03:21:18.529 --> 03:21:19.850
Every subgroup can get better.

03:21:20.650 --> 03:21:28.995
But we do need to pay special attention to certain subgroups that need to grow faster than others because of achievement gaps.

03:21:29.915 --> 03:21:35.317
So with that, we're going to start into this identification of lowest performing 5% of schools.

03:21:35.737 --> 03:21:38.037
We've talked about this in previous board items.

03:21:38.577 --> 03:21:44.719
This will be based on attachment two in the board item that you have.

03:21:44.999 --> 03:21:50.741
You can also, I will sometimes refer back to two memos that have been provided to the board.

03:21:50.781 --> 03:21:58.183
There was an April memo on this topic, as well as a June memo that was extremely dense with a lot of colorful little dots.

03:22:01.664 --> 03:22:06.366
which is a reflection of how complicated this can get very quickly.

03:22:07.347 --> 03:22:11.228
And because of that, fortunately for me, I have others that will help me with that.

03:22:11.929 --> 03:22:16.691
Cindy Kazanas is here, as well as Jenny Singh, whose office is the

03:22:17.831 --> 03:22:21.814
the main architect behind the data simulations that we've seen.

03:22:22.955 --> 03:22:34.804
And because the state board staff and CD staff have worked so closely together, I would even offer David Sapp to assist as we're going through.

03:22:34.864 --> 03:22:44.751
So if there's anything that I haven't quite explained correctly, fortunately, I've got some very smart people who are behind me and close by, Cindy, Jenny, and David, who can help.

03:22:46.212 --> 03:22:50.855
Let me explain something perhaps better or even correct something that I've not quite got right.

03:22:52.836 --> 03:22:55.318
So starting with this identifying a 5%.

03:23:00.149 --> 03:23:07.854
So based on the eligible schools, remember the lowest 5% is based on schools that receive Title I funding.

03:23:09.094 --> 03:23:10.595
That 5% is approximately 298 schools.

03:23:10.615 --> 03:23:12.076
Sorry, did I skip over a slide?

03:23:17.119 --> 03:23:19.321
Thank you.

03:23:19.421 --> 03:23:26.765
298 schools is what makes up currently 5% of Title I. Now, this will change slightly next year.

03:23:26.966 --> 03:23:33.230
And when we release the new dashboard in the fall, by that time, we'll have a new count of Title I schools.

03:23:33.510 --> 03:23:37.593
So the 5% could actually change a little bit for purposes of the simulations.

03:23:38.273 --> 03:23:42.516
And what we've presented to you, it's based on 2015-16, which is 298 schools in Title I.

03:23:47.199 --> 03:23:49.600
That would make up the 5% that we have to identify.

03:23:50.501 --> 03:23:58.304
So in the June memorandum, we did have, again, three options presented as part of that memorandum.

03:23:59.524 --> 03:24:05.047
Three options included this idea of identifying it based on all applicable indicators.

03:24:07.591 --> 03:24:14.557
treating them equally across all, whatever indicators are applicable to an individual school, treating them all equally.

03:24:14.797 --> 03:24:15.738
That was option one.

03:24:16.378 --> 03:24:22.564
Option two was to use all applicable indicators, but do this weighting of one over another, perhaps weighting

03:24:23.084 --> 03:24:27.567
something higher than the others, or weighting something lower than the other indicators.

03:24:28.107 --> 03:24:35.111
And then the third option, what's referred to as the waterfall, is just to start with one indicator, see if you get 5%.

03:24:35.511 --> 03:24:42.015
If you don't, go to a second indicator, add in some more schools, go to a third indicator, which is also a weighting.

03:24:42.055 --> 03:24:44.757
It's just a different sort of weighting.

03:24:47.256 --> 03:25:06.305
So after all the discussions that we've had with you, the indications we've gotten from you and from the feedback from stakeholders, CDE is recommending that we use option one, which is the all applicable indicators, and to use those all applicable indicators in an equal fashion, not weighting one greater than the other.

03:25:06.905 --> 03:25:15.369
This is consistent which was recommended by the technical design group as well as receiving the strongest public support.

03:25:17.915 --> 03:25:38.454
So at the May meeting, many of you made comments that what we would like to do is to link that 5%, which is based on Title I schools only and identifying schools, with the commitment that we've already made in LCFF, which is identifying LEAs or school districts.

03:25:40.095 --> 03:25:42.397
for support and assistance.

03:25:42.857 --> 03:25:59.669
And so we did have attempted from that May meeting to link the two processes in order to meet that goal of having a single local, state, and federal accountability system that's based on continuous improvement and it's not a separate system.

03:25:59.729 --> 03:26:02.911
It's based on LCFF and the eight state priorities.

03:26:05.333 --> 03:26:05.473
So,

03:26:10.502 --> 03:26:12.706
was not the slide I was expecting to come up next.

03:26:16.512 --> 03:26:17.474
But I'll go ahead and go with it.

03:26:19.941 --> 03:26:41.833
So the idea of identifying and linking these two, whether it's schools or districts, we want to work through districts to ensure that the supports that we provide also are aligned so that the assistance that we're giving to schools are the same as what we're giving to districts and the resources available to them.

03:26:42.133 --> 03:26:45.675
And we're trying to build capacity for LEAs so that they can turn around

03:26:47.016 --> 03:26:54.206
and provide support to all schools, not just those identified, but all schools within their district.

03:26:54.687 --> 03:26:59.113
And again, to work all of that within the LCAP process.

03:27:00.915 --> 03:27:02.758
So the baseline methodology.

03:27:04.901 --> 03:27:11.444
So in trying to come up with a linking process of this 5% and LCFF, we have proposed a two-step.

03:27:11.484 --> 03:27:15.386
What we are proposing is a two-step process that would do that linking.

03:27:15.746 --> 03:27:20.408
The first is what we would do, which we refer to as a baseline methodology.

03:27:20.948 --> 03:27:27.932
And that is that we want to make sure that whatever process we use will make sure that we identify

03:27:28.922 --> 03:27:32.125
what here we're calling the very low performing schools.

03:27:32.845 --> 03:27:37.709
That would be the schools with all reds or all reds and one orange.

03:27:38.530 --> 03:27:42.293
I would prefer to refer to them as schools in the greatest need of assistance.

03:27:44.075 --> 03:27:47.197
And so that's probably how I'll be referring to them in the rest of these slides.

03:27:47.678 --> 03:27:53.002
But we want to make sure, because what we looked at in the data and I think what you saw in the memos is the idea that

03:27:53.903 --> 03:27:59.742
If we just take the schools from the LCFF districts that have been identified through the state process.

03:28:00.987 --> 03:28:03.909
we're going to miss some schools that are very low performing.

03:28:04.749 --> 03:28:24.601
So we need, and we talked about this at the last board meeting, we need a safety net, if you will, to make sure that we address the needs of very low performing schools or schools in the greatest need of assistance who may not reside currently in a school district that is identified for LCFF support.

03:28:25.976 --> 03:28:30.260
So first would be to identify through this two-step process.

03:28:31.661 --> 03:28:47.515
First, we have on this slide, as you can see on the left side, it is the ones that are identified by our student group performance through our state law of LCFF, where there's a student group that hasn't met two or more of the indicators.

03:28:48.055 --> 03:28:52.158
And I think we had 181 districts identified through that process.

03:28:52.779 --> 03:29:07.850
The second step of that process was to identify these very low performing schools, schools in greatest need of assistance, all red or all red and an orange, that aren't residing in one of those 181 districts and use that as a criteria to say,

03:29:10.552 --> 03:29:17.846
You may not have made the list, if you will, of those eligible for this system of support.

03:29:18.840 --> 03:29:28.643
because of LCFF, but we are going to make you eligible on a different basis, and that is by having one of these schools that's in greatest need of assistance.

03:29:29.223 --> 03:29:45.467
So when we looked at the data, that added an additional 25 LEAs to the 181, which gets you to the bottom of the slide, means we have 206 LEAs now who would be identified for level two support.

03:29:45.927 --> 03:29:47.768
181 identified through the state process,

03:29:48.740 --> 03:30:06.669
Another 25 that would be identified through this new process, assuming you would approve it, which is to take a look at the schools that are in greatest need of assistance and add those districts where those schools reside along with those identified through the state process.

03:30:09.818 --> 03:30:16.941
So I actually already talked about this slide, which is the definition of what it means to be a school in greatest need of assistance.

03:30:17.001 --> 03:30:20.022
And that is all red or perhaps all red and one orange.

03:30:21.523 --> 03:30:25.124
And make that a second criteria in identifying LEAs.

03:30:28.140 --> 03:30:29.882
I should have been pushing these slides here more.

03:30:30.202 --> 03:30:32.003
I've gone through a couple of them already.

03:30:32.664 --> 03:30:37.388
So based on the data simulations, 181, as I mentioned, identified through LCFF.

03:30:38.970 --> 03:30:41.812
That's per the criteria that you've already adopted back in September.

03:30:43.494 --> 03:30:48.278
59 schools in need of greatest assistance are located in those LEAs.

03:30:49.557 --> 03:30:54.119
And then, as I said, an additional 25 would be added to the 181.

03:30:54.239 --> 03:31:10.825
And out of those 25 LEAs, 31 schools are identified as in need of greatest assistance, getting us to the number of 206 LEAs that would then be eligible for this support.

03:31:11.886 --> 03:31:15.787
I should point out that there was

03:31:18.786 --> 03:31:20.973
error in attachment to.

03:31:22.538 --> 03:31:30.321
I want to say, I wrote it down here, page four in the third paragraph, we made reference to the number 90 there.

03:31:30.801 --> 03:31:36.783
And because 90 shows up so much, it slipped its way into that paragraph where that number really should be 34.

03:31:38.184 --> 03:31:48.048
So if you're paying attention, if you're following in that attachment to on page four, third paragraph, where you see the number 90 in the third paragraph, that really should be the number 34.

03:31:51.522 --> 03:32:16.862
So what we are recommending is to you today that would then end up in our as a state plan is this idea of this baseline methodology in which we do the safety net of identifying those greatest schools in need of support and add those to the LEAs that were identified that have been identified through the state LCFF system.

03:32:19.600 --> 03:32:23.683
So we started having to identify 298 schools.

03:32:25.104 --> 03:32:39.576
And if we apply this methodology of the various schools that need greatest assistance and adding these additional schools in, that identifies 90 schools.

03:32:39.616 --> 03:32:43.079
That still leaves us 208 schools that we need to identify further.

03:32:44.511 --> 03:32:53.075
So that process that I just identified for you does this linking of LCFF to the 5%.

03:32:54.655 --> 03:33:01.118
But again, we still need to identify to meet that 5% requirement 208 schools to make up our 5%.

03:33:03.019 --> 03:33:07.661
So there are an additional three options that we could use to do that with.

03:33:10.282 --> 03:33:26.431
Option one is we could take those LEAs that we've identified in this linking process by using LCFF and the baseline methodology, take those districts, those 181 plus the 25, and select the remainder of those 208 schools from that pool.

03:33:32.523 --> 03:33:45.086
And so what that would leave us is a 5% that made up of, completely made up of the 206 LEAs that are identified through LCFF and this linking process.

03:33:46.499 --> 03:33:47.480
That would be option one.

03:33:47.520 --> 03:33:50.521
CDE could set some criteria to do that.

03:33:51.322 --> 03:33:56.324
Perhaps it's all reds and yellow.

03:33:56.384 --> 03:34:03.788
We could identify what colors would be included in that process to identify the remaining 208 districts.

03:34:06.050 --> 03:34:12.593
Option two is not too dissimilar from option one, but option two

03:34:15.191 --> 03:34:36.503
says instead of setting a firm criteria by which CDE determines completely who those 208 schools are, provide some flexibility to those 206 LEAs that are identified for assistance and allowing them to have a place in that process to identify their own schools to make up the remainder of that 5%.

03:34:36.583 --> 03:34:40.365
Then there is option three,

03:34:42.847 --> 03:34:56.163
I should mention, bottom of the slide, option two probably would, probably not probably, would require us to get some sort of a waiver from the US Department of Education because the state is supposed to identify these schools, not LEAs.

03:34:58.005 --> 03:34:59.647
Option three would be

03:35:02.301 --> 03:35:14.744
Disregard the 206 districts that we've identified for support and just identify the lowest 5% across all districts.

03:35:16.564 --> 03:35:23.046
So what this would do is, once you do that, you could add them to the pool of the 206.

03:35:25.114 --> 03:35:32.938
We are not recommending option three because it's the one that's least likely or the least aligned to LCFF.

03:35:33.798 --> 03:35:38.720
It would basically almost triple the number of additional LEAs needing support.

03:35:39.521 --> 03:35:44.903
And again, it puts more emphasis on the all students group versus the student subgroups.

03:35:46.744 --> 03:35:52.707
What we are recommending is that the board, again, approve the all applicable indicator.

03:35:53.576 --> 03:36:11.263
approve the baseline methodology that would link the two, the LCFF and the 5%, and then provide us some direction on those three options that I just provided to you in terms of identifying the rest of the 208 schools to make up the 5%.

03:36:11.344 --> 03:36:11.404
So.

03:36:22.961 --> 03:36:25.222
We'll have discussion, I guess, after.

03:36:25.242 --> 03:36:26.723
I've got a couple more items to go through.

03:36:27.964 --> 03:36:32.747
Along with this is this, we do have to talk about participation rate.

03:36:33.487 --> 03:36:36.289
That's also a part of the accountability section in the SSA plan.

03:36:37.029 --> 03:36:54.763
As you remember, under NCLB, there was a requirement to make sure that all schools and districts tested 95, no less than 95 percent of their students in English Language Arts and Mathematics, and that was part of the accountability system.

03:36:55.592 --> 03:37:08.144
The old AYP, I hate to even mention it, but I do in that in the old system, if you didn't make the 95% participation rate, you failed AYP automatically.

03:37:08.164 --> 03:37:09.045
94.4%, you failed.

03:37:12.968 --> 03:37:22.091
So, fortunately, under ESSA, they give that responsibility to states on how to implement the 95% participation rate in the accountability system.

03:37:22.451 --> 03:37:33.994
So it's us to make that determination of what to do, how to put it into the accountability system, and then how to respond to school districts that don't make that 95% participation rate.

03:37:34.535 --> 03:37:35.295
So in discussions,

03:37:36.155 --> 03:37:57.866
that we've had, we talked about the idea of putting some sort of a symbol or an icon as part of the dashboard that would symbolize whether the school or the district made the 95% participation rate and we put that icon or that symbol on the dashboard.

03:38:00.703 --> 03:38:06.225
So with that, we would then make in response to that, we do have to have some response to it.

03:38:07.506 --> 03:38:14.429
And what we're recommending is a differentiated response, not an automatic fail of some sort of a system.

03:38:15.289 --> 03:38:25.894
But if you failed it by a small amount, perhaps there would be a light touch, a letter to the district, maybe get something back that says why they didn't make the participation rate.

03:38:26.734 --> 03:38:40.998
Perhaps if it was, you know, not 85% or, you know, quite a bit lower, you know, perhaps we would have them drop some sort of a, you know, what are you going to do to encourage it next year?

03:38:41.418 --> 03:38:44.939
It might depend on whether they had a lot of parent opt-outs or not.

03:38:45.299 --> 03:38:50.586
Because that's a different solution than one that didn't have many parent opt-outs.

03:38:50.806 --> 03:38:59.416
So what I'm suggesting is a differentiated approach to how and how we would respond to those schools that don't make the 95 participation rate.

03:39:00.106 --> 03:39:03.367
So as we've had public comment, it was about half and half.

03:39:03.787 --> 03:39:12.168
Half kind of liked the idea, yeah, put a symbol up there, address these issues on a case-by-case basis, and that's good.

03:39:12.468 --> 03:39:16.629
The other half said, we don't think a single symbol does enough.

03:39:17.749 --> 03:39:21.150
So we went back, did some talking about this.

03:39:21.830 --> 03:39:26.531
And perhaps what we want to do is multiple icons that would represent different things.

03:39:28.032 --> 03:39:30.234
For instance, you can see the bullets here.

03:39:30.575 --> 03:39:45.710
You can have one icon to identify whether both the school and each subgroup met the 95% participation rate, or a second icon that would identify whether they met it school-wide but not met for each student group.

03:39:47.165 --> 03:40:00.176
Perhaps a third icon that would represent someone who made somewhere between 85 and 95, which would be less severe consequence than perhaps somebody who made less than 85%.

03:40:01.517 --> 03:40:09.824
So basically make up different icons to give parents in the community a little more information rather than just a yes or a no.

03:40:10.204 --> 03:40:13.607
And so that is what CDE is recommending, that we use multiple icons.

03:40:16.489 --> 03:40:22.015
I don't think you necessarily want to get in the business of defining what that icon is, whether it's a diamond or a smiley face.

03:40:22.055 --> 03:40:34.086
But the recommendation is that we use multiple icons in the dashboard, again, to let the public know how a school did in terms of participation rate.

03:40:35.691 --> 03:40:40.616
Then the last thing in the accountability section that we need to talk about are long-term and interim goals.

03:40:41.256 --> 03:40:46.562
So there is a requirement in the state plan to identify both

03:40:48.570 --> 03:40:51.531
Long-term goals and then interim progress toward those goals.

03:40:51.591 --> 03:40:55.391
Again, this is a conversation that we've had, I think, at a couple of meetings now.

03:40:56.372 --> 03:41:13.395
You'll see from down below that we are required to do this, setting long-term goals and interim progress goals for the assessments that we have, the cohort graduation rate, and the assessment for English learners, the progress that English learners are making.

03:41:14.994 --> 03:41:23.638
So the California model, what we're calling California model, the five-by-five color grid, if you remember, already really has long-term goals built in.

03:41:24.458 --> 03:41:34.983
Through the color-coded process, we've talked about how we would like our goal is for all schools to reach a green or better in each of the indicators.

03:41:36.223 --> 03:41:41.245
And that the green performance level is certainly a logical place to do that.

03:41:43.103 --> 03:41:49.466
But there are several different green boxes, if you remember cells, if you remember.

03:41:49.506 --> 03:41:51.626
And I think we've got a slide next that shows it, yes.

03:41:52.927 --> 03:42:02.351
So as you can see, the one that's kind of almost right in the middle there that has the orange outline to it, that's based on, again, status and growth.

03:42:03.251 --> 03:42:08.433
those schools or districts that are high and have maintained that high status.

03:42:10.134 --> 03:42:25.499
The recommendation is that we use that as the long-term goal, both the high and the maintained of that high, and that we would consider any of those greens to the right or certainly the blues as being exceeding that goal.

03:42:27.960 --> 03:42:29.101
The one that probably

03:42:31.214 --> 03:42:48.308
we probably should talk a little bit about is the one green cell that is just above that green goal, that would be our long-term goal, and to the left, which is very high status, but they've declined recently.

03:42:49.609 --> 03:42:51.530
So the very high status, but declined.

03:42:52.731 --> 03:42:59.737
So that could go either way with that, whether we consider that meeting the target or not.

03:43:01.052 --> 03:43:05.835
With public comment, as we went through this, we've had, let me get to that.

03:43:08.097 --> 03:43:09.038
I think that comes later.

03:43:09.418 --> 03:43:10.379
But I'm going to go ahead and say it now.

03:43:11.099 --> 03:43:22.927
Through public comment, the public comment that we've gotten on this is that it would be much, much more simple and much more understandable and much easier to explain to public and to parents if,

03:43:24.466 --> 03:43:39.311
all green indicators were considered meeting that goal and not leave one of them out simply because most recently they've declined because that one is a very high status.

03:43:39.831 --> 03:43:47.394
So that was the comment that received back that it would be very difficult to explain to people why they are very high and haven't met it.

03:43:51.397 --> 03:43:55.618
And then there's the timeline for this long-term goal.

03:43:58.679 --> 03:43:59.900
Sorry, let me make one.

03:44:00.460 --> 03:44:02.901
So that's the long-term goal, our recommendation of green.

03:44:03.681 --> 03:44:11.484
And then the interim progress goals, the system is, again, the system that you've designed and built based on status and growth in these cells.

03:44:13.524 --> 03:44:30.338
already allows, once we set that long-term goal for school districts, individual schools, school districts, charter schools, county offices, to take a look at that long-term goal, see where they are currently, and then they can set that goal for interim progress of how they're going to get

03:44:31.319 --> 03:44:32.720
to that long-term goal.

03:44:33.280 --> 03:44:43.910
And that, of course, if you are in a lower status than others in a certain subgroup, they, of course, within the same timeline, would have to make greater growth.

03:44:44.270 --> 03:44:47.794
And that addresses the issue of narrowing the achievement gap.

03:44:48.354 --> 03:44:57.527
So the system's already built once we establish a long-term goal for districts and schools to be able to identify what their interim progress is.

03:44:57.967 --> 03:45:03.435
And built into that system is the idea that lower student groups would have to make greater growth.

03:45:05.727 --> 03:45:08.588
to meet the goal within the timeline.

03:45:09.128 --> 03:45:24.273
We talked last time a timeline of five to seven years after looking at the comments that we got from, not comments, we got comments other states got from peer review process that saying five to seven is unlikely to be successful.

03:45:24.654 --> 03:45:29.075
That what they want is a single digit, not a span of years.

03:45:30.035 --> 03:45:34.657
And so we are recommending that that timeline be seven years.

03:45:36.880 --> 03:45:41.104
So in the end of seven years, we take a look at it and reestablish those goals.

03:45:41.745 --> 03:45:45.369
So again, I think I've hit all of these on the long-term goal.

03:45:47.113 --> 03:45:50.394
The five to seven, these are the public comments.

03:45:51.335 --> 03:45:59.078
I should say on the public comment slide that some of the comments we made was that, ooh, more time is better than less time.

03:46:00.098 --> 03:46:01.879
So which is why we ended up with the seven years.

03:46:02.159 --> 03:46:06.280
Five years was just not enough to kind of get used to the system and try to meet our goals.

03:46:06.340 --> 03:46:13.343
And so the comments from most folks were that seven years would be better than five years.

03:46:13.443 --> 03:46:14.804
Longer, better than shorter.

03:46:16.024 --> 03:46:17.864
And then we talked about interim progress.

03:46:19.245 --> 03:46:22.665
Talked about all blue-green cells as the recommendation.

03:46:23.866 --> 03:46:28.607
And we talked about the timeline of the recommendation of seven years.

03:46:31.367 --> 03:46:33.528
So that's the end of the accountability section.

03:46:37.069 --> 03:46:38.549
Am I turning it over to?

03:46:39.829 --> 03:46:43.870
I'd like to introduce Tom Adams, Deputy Superintendent of Teaching and Learning Branch.

03:46:46.834 --> 03:46:50.588
for that clear explanation of such a difficult, complex thing.

03:46:53.132 --> 03:46:53.532
Okay.

03:46:54.113 --> 03:46:55.314
Good afternoon.

03:46:55.654 --> 03:46:58.956
I'm the Deputy Superintendent for the Teaching and Learning Support Branch.

03:47:00.557 --> 03:47:08.623
Just for your information, what that means is really I have the welcome additions of special education and expanded learning to my branch.

03:47:08.703 --> 03:47:15.628
And so I'm really happy that Kristen Wright and Michael Funk, both those division directors, are becoming part of my team.

03:47:15.688 --> 03:47:21.733
And definitely we're all looking forward, we're looking forward for all of us working together.

03:47:23.234 --> 03:47:24.956
Just a note here.

03:47:27.618 --> 03:47:31.341
This is probably my 19th year of presenting before the board.

03:47:31.401 --> 03:47:38.288
So unlike Melanie Shope, please forgive me if my presentation is of low wattage and waning enthusiasm.

03:47:48.107 --> 03:47:52.913
Look, my topic is ineffective and my wife told me, you know, you're so appropriate for that.

03:48:01.134 --> 03:48:04.477
This is great following Carrick after I feel lively now.

03:48:06.439 --> 03:48:10.843
So, Title I, Part A, Access to Educators.

03:48:10.943 --> 03:48:19.731
So, ESSO requires us to actually deal with three categories in terms of educators, inexperienced, out of field, and ineffective teachers.

03:48:20.912 --> 03:48:29.416
This is important because as you talked at your last board meeting, one of the most important issues is equity of instruction or equity of educators for our students.

03:48:30.577 --> 03:48:39.081
And in terms of our public input on ineffective teacher, there was common agreement on the need for a consistent statewide definition.

03:48:40.021 --> 03:48:42.204
But I just want to add what's not on the slide here.

03:48:42.224 --> 03:48:53.299
No one was calling for anything tied to test scores or some type of value-added model that maybe was part of the debate a few years ago.

03:48:53.520 --> 03:48:54.541
No one actually went there.

03:48:55.823 --> 03:49:02.752
There was in the discussion a desire not to disrupt good practices that are happening at the local level.

03:49:03.393 --> 03:49:11.424
In that sense, there are people already have issues, have addressed the issue of ineffective teacher and how to remedy that at the local level.

03:49:13.256 --> 03:49:19.825
But they all recognize there is a challenge in terms of creating a consensus of the definition of ineffective teacher.

03:49:21.146 --> 03:49:26.954
Constraining us, or maybe not constraining us, but being our North Star way of

03:49:28.115 --> 03:49:34.399
really thinking about this, though, is we had to think about it in the context of LCFF and Greatness by Design.

03:49:35.760 --> 03:49:44.165
Greatness by Design, as you know, it has a lot of good recommendations in there about educator equity and ineffective teachers.

03:49:44.185 --> 03:49:52.790
So we have, we do have a very good document on guidance to local school districts on how to remedy those situations and how best to do it.

03:49:54.470 --> 03:49:58.032
Local control funding formula.

03:49:58.372 --> 03:50:00.813
That should be LCFF, not LCCF.

03:50:02.574 --> 03:50:04.874
Imagine a bureaucrat getting his acronyms wrong.

03:50:06.495 --> 03:50:18.040
But the key there is I think we all suffer from, or at least I can speak for myself, I do suffer from post-traumatic NCLB syndrome, right?

03:50:18.480 --> 03:50:21.261
And I do want to have one system of accountability

03:50:21.701 --> 03:50:27.214
the LCAP and be able to have a unitary system of support.

03:50:30.189 --> 03:50:42.652
So, we want to make sure that ineffective teacher built upon LCFF priority one, which is to focus on whether teachers are either misaligned or teaching without a credential.

03:50:42.893 --> 03:50:56.596
So, California in the state plan will meet that requirement by reporting at the school and district levels data about the various credential statuses recognized by the state or the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing.

03:50:57.276 --> 03:50:58.697
And let me just repeat that.

03:50:59.637 --> 03:51:02.960
It's about really when it comes down to the credential status.

03:51:04.261 --> 03:51:05.181
And why is that?

03:51:05.662 --> 03:51:07.543
Because that's the system we have in place.

03:51:08.124 --> 03:51:16.870
One of the things we want to do here in California in this as a state plan is one, reinforce our LCFF and LCAP system.

03:51:17.310 --> 03:51:23.455
And two, build it upon the systems that already exist there in place, which is our credentialing process.

03:51:26.283 --> 03:51:33.591
So these multiple data points then will provide a more complete picture of the educator workforce at school, district, and state levels.

03:51:34.251 --> 03:51:39.356
Data could also provide the basis for development of local plans for equitable access to teachers.

03:51:39.376 --> 03:51:46.964
One of the things we want to make sure is that credentialed teachers and where they are in terms of if they're

03:51:48.826 --> 03:51:58.853
pre-credential where they are, make sure that they're evenly distributed across the district and equitable distributions to the different schools in the district.

03:51:58.933 --> 03:52:11.241
And so in that sense, it's important for us then to note that by focusing on the credentialing process, we are using that to ensure educator equity.

03:52:12.922 --> 03:52:13.282
Okay.

03:52:15.254 --> 03:52:30.859
So, then it becomes the issue of supporting effective instruction, Title II Part A. Because as we know, it's one thing to have, to examine the credentialing process and where people are.

03:52:30.899 --> 03:52:37.642
It's another thing to actually have opportunities to keep our teachers on a cycle of continuous improvement.

03:52:38.462 --> 03:52:49.351
And so we have two opportunities in terms of state work level, in terms of Title II Part A. There's statewide activities at 5% and leadership activities at 3%.

03:52:49.871 --> 03:52:51.933
And that should be school leadership initiatives.

03:52:54.574 --> 03:52:58.496
As you know, we talked a little bit about California system and support earlier.

03:52:59.336 --> 03:53:05.758
Just to reinforce equity, we want to be in terms of the public comment when we went out there.

03:53:08.679 --> 03:53:13.741
As well as similar to today's discussion, we want equity to be the focus.

03:53:14.541 --> 03:53:19.983
However, public comment wanted us to provide more details to match the aspirations.

03:53:21.283 --> 03:53:30.225
They wanted to support existing efforts and partnerships that we have with county offices and the California Subject Matter Projects.

03:53:30.385 --> 03:53:33.905
I kind of think of this as our friends telling us, hey, don't forget us.

03:53:33.965 --> 03:53:37.186
Remember all the good work we've done already, so we want to keep doing it.

03:53:39.627 --> 03:53:46.928
They wanted us to address new areas of professional learning, such as restorative practices, social-emotional learning, and working with traumatized youth.

03:53:48.548 --> 03:53:55.130
Public input also wants school leaders to know evidence-based practices and how to support teachers in their work.

03:53:55.790 --> 03:54:00.871
And this is something we've also found in our standards implementation process as well.

03:54:01.851 --> 03:54:12.033
And public input wanted us to include a plan to address teacher shortages in science, math, special education, and bilingual education.

03:54:14.269 --> 03:54:16.672
So some of the proposed revisions.

03:54:18.454 --> 03:54:24.721
An equity planning process for Title II Part A, the 5% set aside for statewide activities.

03:54:25.482 --> 03:54:28.846
And here we go with the regional support structure.

03:54:30.167 --> 03:54:42.199
LEA leadership teams would collaborate to address equitable issues within their districts and schools and focus on LEA-led solutions.

03:54:42.460 --> 03:54:48.426
Let me say that again, LEA-led solutions through intra- and inter-district collaboration.

03:54:49.106 --> 03:55:00.817
So as much as it would be a regional support, there would also be this opportunity to go thematic and address issues that may not just be addressed within your own regional resources.

03:55:01.958 --> 03:55:08.344
And we want to make sure that is coordinated with the proposed California school leadership system.

03:55:09.225 --> 03:55:11.447
So that gets to the 3% set aside.

03:55:12.928 --> 03:55:24.857
This is a subgrant and it's to develop expertise and capacity within the statewide system of support to strengthen school leaders' abilities to address inequities by supporting teachers and engaging students.

03:55:25.678 --> 03:55:32.466
This is something we also found that was important if you look at our standards implementation process in the different content areas.

03:55:33.126 --> 03:55:42.897
One of the key features in all the four content areas that we have built out so far in terms of their aspirations of where we need to go is to improve the professional learning for administrators.

03:55:44.400 --> 03:55:50.230
And here we're not just talking about the single charismatic principal coming at a school site.

03:55:50.270 --> 03:55:55.981
We're really talking about leadership in the broadest sense that it's shared and that it's collaborative.

03:55:59.288 --> 03:56:07.370
Other important revisions include supporting the standards implementation via the curriculum framework rollout, something I've already mentioned before.

03:56:07.970 --> 03:56:15.311
Affirm the continued support of the California Subject Matter Projects and their vital role in innovative professional learning.

03:56:15.831 --> 03:56:25.953
Just a note here, remember a lot of our frameworks rely on writers and developers who are connected to or part of the California Subject Matter Project.

03:56:27.053 --> 03:56:32.079
And use Title II Part VIII funds to improve equitable access to teachers.

03:56:32.139 --> 03:56:35.182
That's going to be an important part now that we'll be collecting data.

03:56:35.643 --> 03:56:38.466
Actually saying, okay, now what do we do with this?

03:56:38.546 --> 03:56:40.928
How do we make it work well for our students?

03:56:41.929 --> 03:56:51.697
And lastly, plan to increase the number of teachers in teacher shortage areas such as science, math, special education, and bilingual education.

03:56:51.837 --> 03:56:55.040
It shouldn't say a plan, it's more we will create a plan.

03:56:56.441 --> 03:56:58.363
And we'll note that in the ESSA plan.

03:57:01.875 --> 03:57:04.136
That is my final slide there.

03:57:05.437 --> 03:57:12.221
I'm happy now to turn over the microphone and podium to Chief Deputy Superintendent Glenn Price.

03:57:17.021 --> 03:57:17.662
Thank you, Tom.

03:57:17.902 --> 03:57:18.522
Thank you, Carrick.

03:57:18.562 --> 03:57:20.764
And thank you, Barb, for awesome presentations.

03:57:20.864 --> 03:57:38.377
And I'd like to continue the discussion into the area of Title IV, Title IV Part A. And I think this is a really important opportunity for the state of California to take this tranche of federal funds and invest it in support of our state priorities.

03:57:38.937 --> 03:57:51.767
And there's been a couple of changes in Title IV Part A since we last met in May, that even though it's a smaller part of the ESSA State Plan, really necessitates some board discussion and guidance as we move forward.

03:57:52.348 --> 03:57:57.552
So Title IV Part A is known as the Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants Program.

03:57:58.892 --> 03:58:02.833
And it aims to increase the capacity of LEAs in three areas.

03:58:03.233 --> 03:58:08.894
First is well-rounded education, safe and healthy students, and effective use of technology.

03:58:09.434 --> 03:58:18.576
So some of the things that ESSA talks about in the area of well-rounded educational opportunities line up quite a bit with priorities that we've been working on in the state of California.

03:58:19.016 --> 03:58:23.097
College and career guidance, STEM, including computer science projects,

03:58:23.473 --> 03:58:29.777
foreign language, environmental education, and other activities that can support a well-rounded education.

03:58:30.417 --> 03:58:44.867
And safe and healthy students, also some key activities cited that really line up well with our work in California, particularly around in Priority 6 of LCFF, drug and violence prevention, school-based mental health services,

03:58:45.327 --> 03:58:50.849
preventing bullying and harassment and other areas in a similar vein.

03:58:51.809 --> 03:59:09.955
In technology, looking at a variety of efforts, we're limited there to 15% in one of our options and 25% to what can actually be invested in infrastructure, but there's a significant emphasis on the use of technology in our classrooms and schools.

03:59:10.375 --> 03:59:14.237
So three important areas, and this program was newly authorized when ESSA

03:59:15.217 --> 03:59:17.978
excuse me, when ESEA was reauthorized.

03:59:18.758 --> 03:59:38.682
So, some important transitions in the funding kind of history, recent history of Title IV Part A. When Congress first authorized ESEA or reauthorized, they included 1.6 billion and everybody in the nation kind of stood up and cheered and said, yay, we're going to get some funding, significant funding in this area.

03:59:39.162 --> 03:59:45.783
But then when it came time to the Omnibus Budget Bill, Congress only allocated $400 million in fiscal year 2017.

03:59:46.843 --> 03:59:50.324
And it's allocated, importantly, as a one-time allocation.

03:59:50.344 --> 04:00:05.367
And it's probably also important to remember, even though Congress hasn't received well the President's budget plan, that for that plan for 2018-19, there's a proposal to eliminate totally funding for this program.

04:00:06.788 --> 04:00:11.873
There's two ways that the funding can be allocated to the state of California.

04:00:12.254 --> 04:00:16.778
The first would be to do it as a formula grant, and the second would be to do it as a competitive grant.

04:00:16.818 --> 04:00:21.503
And I'll talk briefly about those as we move along.

04:00:21.543 --> 04:00:23.946
But to keep in mind, in terms of the overall

04:00:24.426 --> 04:00:29.471
overall funding amount of that $400 million that would be allocated nationally.

04:00:29.531 --> 04:00:35.256
We sometimes think, you know, in California, whatever is allocated nationally will get about 10 to 13 percent.

04:00:35.637 --> 04:00:36.537
And that's the case here.

04:00:36.778 --> 04:00:37.999
We'll get exactly $46,418,059.

04:00:42.402 --> 04:00:49.091
Of which 95%, whichever option we pursue, needs to be allocated directly to LEAs.

04:00:49.672 --> 04:00:54.177
4% can be used for state level activities and 464,000 or no more than 1% can be used for administration.

04:00:59.650 --> 04:01:20.005
The thing to keep in mind, and I won't dive too deep in the weeds on it around Title IV Part A, is that there is also the opportunity to transfer Title IV Part A funds that can be transferred to other titles, both at the LEA level and at the SEA level, we can transfer the state-level activity funds.

04:01:21.303 --> 04:01:41.755
So as we went out for stakeholder feedback, as Barb mentioned earlier, there wasn't a ton of stakeholder feedback around Title IV Part A. And the important thing to keep in mind, too, is that the stakeholder feedback came before the passage of the omnibus budget bill and it came on the prior draft of the plan when we didn't know yet that there would be the competitive option.

04:01:42.336 --> 04:01:47.379
So stakeholders were reacting to what was in our plan, which was based on the formula option only.

04:01:47.839 --> 04:01:57.427
There was a call, as in many other areas of the plan, for more detail, for historical context, and some questions around how these grants would be implemented.

04:01:58.087 --> 04:02:06.034
A significant call for inclusion in guidance materials, ideas for how LAs might use the funds in different areas.

04:02:06.995 --> 04:02:10.321
and for including them in a birth to age 8 continuum.

04:02:11.603 --> 04:02:19.677
There was, you know, comments around how we might target the funds and support using them potentially for support for professional development.

04:02:20.874 --> 04:02:28.843
So we'd like guidance from the board on which option we should pursue for Title IV Part A. And there's two major ones.

04:02:29.483 --> 04:02:32.466
The first would be to do a formula allocation.

04:02:32.927 --> 04:02:39.154
And how this would work is that LEAs would receive allocations based on their share of Title I Part A funds.

04:02:39.214 --> 04:02:40.255
So how many

04:02:40.655 --> 04:02:44.599
Title I students they have in their districts.

04:02:45.000 --> 04:02:54.670
There must be a $10,000 minimum grant and grantees who receive more than $30,000 would need to conduct a needs assessment every three years.

04:02:56.131 --> 04:03:01.897
The way that the regulations are structured, if the formula allocation were pursued,

04:03:03.238 --> 04:03:18.373
LEAs at the LEA level would need to spend 20% on well-rounded education, 20% on safe and healthy students, so these are the categories of funding, and no more than 15% on technology infrastructure.

04:03:19.346 --> 04:03:31.592
Under option two, a competitive grant, which is the recommendation that we're making, we would seek to award and prioritize the awards based on greatest need, geographic diversity, those are required.

04:03:31.972 --> 04:03:36.914
We could also set additional priorities per our state priorities for the competition.

04:03:37.574 --> 04:03:41.776
And we would also be required to ensure that $10,000 minimum grant

04:03:43.337 --> 04:03:47.719
It would be a one-year term, but the funds could be spent over a longer period than that.

04:03:48.619 --> 04:03:55.481
And importantly, we would only be required at the state level to maintain the percentage of funds being allocated.

04:03:55.541 --> 04:04:04.184
So at least 20% at the state level on well-rounded education, 20% on safe and healthy students, and no more than 25% on technology infrastructure.

04:04:06.725 --> 04:04:14.493
This would allow LEAs to come forward either individually or as consortia with proposals focused on a particular area.

04:04:15.634 --> 04:04:24.543
And then at the state level, we would make sure that we were hitting on these categories of 20% for well-rounded 25% for safe and healthy students.

04:04:27.415 --> 04:04:39.220
So we're recommending that the board provide us guidance to pursue the competitive grant as part of the next version of the ESSA state plan with the parameters that I described.

04:04:39.761 --> 04:04:51.626
The reasons there are that we feel that this would really support LEAs and their schools to engage in some real innovation and creativity around how they might come forward with ways to address the needs in their districts.

04:04:52.226 --> 04:05:01.410
It will provide us as a state the opportunity to really collect lessons learned and sustainable strategies that we can infuse into our technical assistance.

04:05:01.930 --> 04:05:10.534
And it will allow us to calibrate this work with our developing statewide system of support that you discussed under Board Item 2.

04:05:11.314 --> 04:05:21.158
So we're recommending Option 2 under Title IV Part A, but bottom line is we're looking for guidance as to which option that you would like to pursue going forward.

04:05:22.359 --> 04:05:26.104
So Title IV, I got the, as Chief Deputy, one doesn't get many perks.

04:05:27.225 --> 04:05:29.568
But I did get to select which part of the presentation I would do.

04:05:29.649 --> 04:05:32.012
So I got the short one.

04:05:33.791 --> 04:05:38.973
And I think that concludes our presentation around the ESSA State Plan.

04:05:40.173 --> 04:05:43.474
It's obviously a very pivotal moment for us as we move forward.

04:05:43.954 --> 04:05:52.156
And we are, as Barb mentioned earlier, asking for your approval of the revisions contained in Attachment 1 and the minor ones contained in Attachment 4.

04:05:52.536 --> 04:06:01.438
We'll bring back a draft to you in September 2017, but also be putting out a draft at the beginning of August for public comment and review.

04:06:02.305 --> 04:06:05.712
So with that, turning the mic back over to you, President Kirst.

04:06:05.933 --> 04:06:06.334
Okay.

04:06:07.155 --> 04:06:11.905
And so in our following our typical order, we have, I would like to call on our

04:06:12.674 --> 04:06:19.555
a federal liaison member, Ting Sun first, and she and I are the federal, the liaisons for federal aid.

04:06:20.055 --> 04:06:26.196
We didn't have much business in the first three years or four, could wrap it up in a half an hour, right?

04:06:26.416 --> 04:06:29.797
And so you would, I think, react first.

04:06:29.857 --> 04:06:37.098
And I'd like you to just react, I think the best way to organize this is Carrick's, Carrick Ashley's presentation on accountability.

04:06:37.938 --> 04:06:39.639
And we'll have a go around on that.

04:06:39.779 --> 04:06:41.819
So, and then we'll go to title.

04:06:43.058 --> 04:06:51.500
to Tom Adams' presentation, and then we'll go to the Title IV presentation because mixing them all together doesn't make much sense.

04:06:51.540 --> 04:07:08.505
So could you make some comments from your position as federal liaison first, and then I'd like to go to Board Member Sandoval, who is liaison to special education next, given the amount of comments and letters about the data simulations

04:07:09.253 --> 04:07:16.201
and how the special ed students figure into the identification of LEAs for support under LCFF.

04:07:16.241 --> 04:07:19.324
So those two first, and then we'll go around the table.

04:07:19.424 --> 04:07:19.804
Go ahead.

04:07:20.305 --> 04:07:21.526
Thank you, President Kirst.

04:07:22.968 --> 04:07:27.453
First, of course, I have to commend the CDE's work on pulling this data together.

04:07:28.093 --> 04:07:31.655
and the analysis of various options under that Title One accountability.

04:07:31.795 --> 04:07:34.777
I know it's a lot of work in a very short time.

04:07:35.277 --> 04:07:41.940
And I recognize that the huge challenge of trying to jigsaw this LCFF with ESSA.

04:07:42.400 --> 04:07:45.642
And so there was a lot of work in here.

04:07:46.983 --> 04:07:50.244
I am comfortable with the proposed all indicators approach.

04:07:50.965 --> 04:07:54.547
It's the most consistent with our approach to the LCFF.

04:07:55.727 --> 04:07:58.850
by not giving weights on particular indicators.

04:07:59.331 --> 04:08:04.736
And it seems to have the best, the most public support during that comment period.

04:08:05.877 --> 04:08:12.303
I also appreciate the proposed baseline methodology.

04:08:12.323 --> 04:08:19.569
I think it again lines with what we are developing under LCFF.

04:08:20.730 --> 04:08:30.082
And under state law, we provide that assistance to LEAs and we look at all eight LCFF priorities as areas in that process.

04:08:30.743 --> 04:08:38.713
So I think that's a good starting point for identifying schools and also focusing on how those schools get support.

04:08:40.558 --> 04:08:50.571
I share, however, a lot of the concerns from stakeholders that focusing only on LEAs might leave out some very high need schools.

04:08:50.711 --> 04:08:57.320
And I understand that this was a key point in some of the SBE discussions at our last meeting.

04:08:58.624 --> 04:09:07.928
Identifying a group of very high need schools that are essentially struggling on all relevant indicators seems to be an important LEA criteria under LCFF.

04:09:08.008 --> 04:09:21.194
So a district that is doing reasonably well overall, but has one of these schools clearly could use some support to figure out how to do better in meeting the needs of its students.

04:09:21.554 --> 04:09:22.615
I think that makes sense.

04:09:25.396 --> 04:09:31.447
The baseline, but we all know that the baseline methodology is not going to get us that 5%.

04:09:31.928 --> 04:09:34.833
And I think that's where we've become very uneasy.

04:09:38.303 --> 04:09:46.186
I know that while CDE thoroughly laid out the range of options for us, and I do see pros and cons of options one and two.

04:09:47.167 --> 04:09:48.747
It doesn't seem to be a perfect solution.

04:09:50.328 --> 04:09:58.751
And I think we're going to, we have a very, very challenging policy discussion and decision ahead of us on that.

04:10:01.505 --> 04:10:10.287
I appreciate how important it is to many stakeholders that while we're identifying schools, then we're concerned that these are going to be labeling and shaming schools.

04:10:10.747 --> 04:10:13.367
I think we do need to change our mindset.

04:10:13.408 --> 04:10:17.768
And I think this has been repeated over again, that this is not the program improvement.

04:10:18.449 --> 04:10:21.409
Oh, you're just a terrible school type of attitude.

04:10:21.429 --> 04:10:27.831
This is about which schools do we need to provide attention and support to.

04:10:28.891 --> 04:10:29.191
So,

04:10:32.122 --> 04:10:37.047
But again, I go back to the limitations on the data that we currently have.

04:10:37.948 --> 04:10:41.391
And this is where we go beyond.

04:10:41.411 --> 04:10:45.616
I think most people are comfortable with the baseline methodology, but when we go beyond that.

04:10:47.277 --> 04:10:51.301
And so I have to say that, you know, in

04:10:53.373 --> 04:10:58.375
thinking about this over the last week and how we identify schools and what that next level is.

04:10:58.395 --> 04:11:05.338
I am very uncomfortable with the fact that we don't have enough data at this point in time.

04:11:06.018 --> 04:11:07.739
Indicators are not fully online.

04:11:11.187 --> 04:11:17.428
There was, in reviewing the materials and the letters from the public, there was a lot of focus on specific numbers.

04:11:17.488 --> 04:11:24.770
And I certainly was there making my charts, trying to figure out how to identify schools and what does that mean to different schools, to different LEAs.

04:11:26.330 --> 04:11:35.372
And at the same time, we also know all these numbers are going to change as we continue to develop the R in that word of maturing, this maturing system.

04:11:36.932 --> 04:11:51.977
So and interestingly enough, as we are looking to submit our ESSA plan, we know that in three months after the plan submission deadline, we're going to have updated data in the fall.

04:11:52.057 --> 04:11:55.538
And that might provide us with additional and different information.

04:11:56.618 --> 04:12:03.241
So rather than deciding on the detail of the methodology today,

04:12:06.568 --> 04:12:20.854
I would prefer, I would propose that we decide on a general framework now and then flesh out the specifics of what we're, once we get more information in the updated dashboard.

04:12:21.714 --> 04:12:38.541
And I one of the questions I have for staff is how how can we do that in the ESSA plan and then also provide us with a little bit more time as we gather more data so that we have some room to do some tweaking and some modifications as we get additional information.

04:12:39.421 --> 04:12:50.211
So I don't see the benefit of committing to a September plan in a specific approach to the 5% based on the limited data that we currently have.

04:12:51.132 --> 04:12:57.318
And I believe that the school identification for doesn't even start until the fall 2018.

04:12:57.358 --> 04:12:57.398
So

04:13:01.528 --> 04:13:14.260
I'm proposing that rather than come up with very specifics, that we come up with a framework within this ESSA plan and then give us some room to be able to look at more data moving forward.

04:13:15.021 --> 04:13:17.503
So I'll stop there for now.

04:13:18.464 --> 04:13:22.107
But I thought it would be important to put that out there at this time.

04:13:22.648 --> 04:13:26.011
And then I want to hear from my fellow board members.

04:13:26.622 --> 04:13:34.828
Just let me, as other federal liaison, clarify that the ESSA plan does not require us to identify the specific schools in the plan.

04:13:35.468 --> 04:13:38.971
The ESSA operates in 2018-2019 cycle.

04:13:39.631 --> 04:13:44.354
The LCFF, however, is in the 2017-2018 school year cycle.

04:13:45.055 --> 04:13:54.542
So we have the option of passing now on identifying the remaining 3% and putting then in the plan the process we would use

04:13:55.439 --> 04:14:05.076
Lots of districts have spoken to us in schools saying, you're using old data, that we would like much more current data.

04:14:05.680 --> 04:14:11.746
And to identify schools using old data specifically has been an issue.

04:14:11.826 --> 04:14:21.036
So that's, I think, part of the rationale that board member Sun is using.

04:14:22.477 --> 04:14:23.278
Carrick Asher.

04:14:23.318 --> 04:14:27.382
Let me just comment quickly and then I know you want to get other board comments.

04:14:29.284 --> 04:14:32.626
So that's understandable and it certainly makes sense.

04:14:33.087 --> 04:14:55.621
So I think if we have direction from you and approval on using baseline methodology and the all indicators, not waiting any, then I think we can bring back for you after we have data from the fall dashboard, updated information about where these schools and districts lay and we can have a more informed conversation then.

04:14:56.201 --> 04:14:59.766
So I think we can work with that in terms of the SSA plan.

04:15:01.826 --> 04:15:09.668
Okay, so that's your comment and then I made one and now Board Member Sandoval, why don't you go and then I'll start around the table.

04:15:10.628 --> 04:15:11.028
Thank you.

04:15:11.088 --> 04:15:17.930
I just want to acknowledge the thoughtful comments and responses to this particular item from our stakeholders.

04:15:18.150 --> 04:15:27.252
And I read the feedback with great interest, especially as it relates to students with disabilities and discussions about this particular group.

04:15:28.012 --> 04:15:35.638
because it's very clear, it's an alarming clarity that students with disabilities are consistently the lowest performing.

04:15:36.979 --> 04:15:39.922
They are now and have been for many, many years.

04:15:40.242 --> 04:15:55.695
And I think the promise of LCFF and us moving towards one system that is maturing as we speak is that we have an opportunity, I think, through multi-tiered systems of support to serve all of our students, to meet them where they need to be met,

04:15:56.776 --> 04:16:05.844
And I was reading just the assertion that somehow the support system would be driven by students with disabilities and their performance.

04:16:06.584 --> 04:16:10.428
And I think that the system that we are transitioning into

04:16:13.221 --> 04:16:14.602
I don't see that happening.

04:16:15.202 --> 04:16:26.066
I don't feel that somehow the resources will be diverted to other students because of including our students with disabilities into this one system.

04:16:26.626 --> 04:16:32.949
And I think that what we've learned is that this bifurcated system does not serve our students well.

04:16:33.129 --> 04:16:36.170
And that's not just students with disabilities, but any of our students.

04:16:36.971 --> 04:16:43.679
So, I also want to remind us because this statistic has stayed with me for the last couple of years and it hasn't shifted very much.

04:16:45.221 --> 04:16:51.449
70% of students with disabilities are a member of at least one of the LCFF groups.

04:16:52.370 --> 04:16:55.031
So we're talking about the same students.

04:16:55.371 --> 04:16:59.453
And I don't want to minimize the concerns at all.

04:17:00.674 --> 04:17:07.597
But I also just learned that for foster youth, for every four foster youth, one of them is a student with a disability.

04:17:08.817 --> 04:17:14.640
So we have to remember that we have to set up systems of support for all of our students.

04:17:15.658 --> 04:17:23.320
And the intention is not to ignore the needs of students in the different LCFF groups at all.

04:17:24.140 --> 04:17:32.242
And I think that our state systemic improvement plan prioritizing improved supports for all students is a shift in that direction.

04:17:32.262 --> 04:17:41.785
I also see that what's happening in higher education, our partners in higher education colleges and universities with teacher preparation programs and credentialing.

04:17:42.385 --> 04:17:50.254
Preparing our teachers to meet student needs in a general education environment is going to serve our students, not only with disabilities, but all of our students.

04:17:50.915 --> 04:17:59.304
So I think that we have to move beyond the isolation of a previous system and focus again on one system that serves

04:18:00.405 --> 04:18:01.306
all of our students.

04:18:01.806 --> 04:18:08.951
And of course, this increased emphasis on differentiated instruction to meet the needs of all our students where they're at.

04:18:09.931 --> 04:18:24.141
So I just want to make sure that we remain focused on a single system that's student-centered and that gives all of our teachers the support that they need to meet students' needs in a general education environment to the degree that we can do that.

04:18:25.475 --> 04:18:26.035
Okay, thank you.

04:18:26.055 --> 04:18:28.317
So I'm going to ask each board member if they want to comment.

04:18:28.337 --> 04:18:31.279
I'll start with Board Member Holliday since I'm looking this way.

04:18:36.542 --> 04:18:42.085
Carrick, were you the ineffective teacher that was... No, we're just now on... Oh, I'm sorry.

04:18:42.105 --> 04:18:43.266
Wasn't this part of the...

04:18:44.677 --> 04:18:49.760
It's part of it, but I'd like to do it topic by topic, sticking just with accountability.

04:18:50.420 --> 04:18:52.442
Try and settle that, then go to the teacher.

04:18:52.462 --> 04:18:55.964
I apologize, is the ineffective teacher part of the accountability section?

04:18:56.264 --> 04:18:56.504
No.

04:18:56.724 --> 04:18:57.144
I'm sorry.

04:19:03.648 --> 04:19:05.229
No, go to Olivia next.

04:19:05.949 --> 04:19:07.310
Okay.

04:19:08.511 --> 04:19:11.433
I would make one other comment on the updating the data.

04:19:13.132 --> 04:19:21.961
Talking about our Smarter Balanced Achievement results, educational researchers stress the longer trend line you have, the better your data.

04:19:22.341 --> 04:19:26.806
This is a new test where we have two years of data.

04:19:27.006 --> 04:19:28.608
If we could get a third year,

04:19:29.443 --> 04:19:34.848
we would much better able to see the change factor there in that.

04:19:35.048 --> 04:19:44.436
And so that's another argument for, to me, for updating the data, which is more of a technical longitudinal argument, but that I want to throw into the mix.

04:19:45.196 --> 04:19:46.057
Board Member Strauss.

04:19:48.164 --> 04:19:59.499
So first, I just want to thank First President Kurz for framing the issues that we are faced with in developing our ESSA plan and linking it to our LCFF plan.

04:19:59.579 --> 04:20:02.543
So I thought those really helped to set the context.

04:20:03.084 --> 04:20:04.686
And so I just want to thank you on that.

04:20:05.467 --> 04:20:18.880
Also, I think it's just important to reinforce that our goal to go for a single coherent plan as best we can is, I believe, is the clear message in all of the work trying to connect it.

04:20:19.220 --> 04:20:21.603
We know when we had NCLB and we had our

04:20:22.003 --> 04:20:23.784
API, and we had AYP.

04:20:24.084 --> 04:20:26.605
We're trying to do a better job this time.

04:20:26.685 --> 04:20:36.749
And so, I do think it's a challenge because LCFF focuses on LEAs, which is important, and we're being challenged to also identify low-performing schools.

04:20:37.149 --> 04:20:47.873
So, I actually really appreciate the challenging data runs that CDE has been doing and working with our staff as well to try to figure out what's the right way to go about this.

04:20:48.533 --> 04:20:57.920
And actually really support the blended approach, if that's the right way to say it, where we identify the LEAs, but we don't leave out the most struggling schools.

04:20:58.200 --> 04:21:07.868
Because I think under the LEAs in some districts, particularly based on housing patterns and things, you'll find a pocket of, say, low performing or more impoverished area.

04:21:08.408 --> 04:21:11.549
in a higher performing district so they get masked and they get hidden.

04:21:11.889 --> 04:21:14.070
And I don't think that any of us want that to happen.

04:21:14.150 --> 04:21:23.493
So I really like the idea of identifying first LCFF, the districts that qualify for additional support, and then making sure we don't miss our most struggling schools.

04:21:23.513 --> 04:21:26.434
So I support that methodology and that support.

04:21:26.994 --> 04:21:40.969
The other thing is that, and thank you Member Sandoval for making the comment about our students with disabilities and how many of them are also English learners and low-income students as well, and that they often represent many groups.

04:21:41.289 --> 04:21:44.492
And I think that while it may trigger the support

04:21:45.433 --> 04:21:59.930
As service providers start to help LEAs, I feel like that may trigger the support, but LEAs may have all kinds of issues as they unpack their data and their root causes of what's going on, and it shouldn't limit the support.

04:22:00.410 --> 04:22:11.239
once they're identified to say, well, your students with disabilities we're identifying, but your English learners are an issue as well, or your African American males, they're a problem and you need to give them support.

04:22:11.279 --> 04:22:16.242
And so I don't think we mean to limit our support

04:22:17.063 --> 04:22:19.745
certainly school districts and schools are identified.

04:22:19.785 --> 04:22:41.961
But I think as I just want to make sure it's clear, at least an intent by this board, that the SERP support supports the LEA and the schools as they identify the variety of issues at their sites levels and their district levels and that the support providers should be able to specialize and differentiate the kinds of needs that are identified based on the data

04:22:42.581 --> 04:22:46.623
and all their LCAP surveys and all their climate surveys and those things as well.

04:22:46.703 --> 04:22:54.726
So, I don't believe it's the intent, at least I would say as a board member, it's not the intent to limit the support once you're identified for additional support.

04:22:55.106 --> 04:22:58.428
That you're, you ought to be able to do your own data analysis.

04:22:58.688 --> 04:23:05.951
And I think CCE is learning that as they help pilot districts and counties unpack the data that there are lots of complications

04:23:06.371 --> 04:23:10.653
That they need to look at, particularly in the context of the that they're serving.

04:23:10.693 --> 04:23:18.217
And so I just want to make that clear too, because I think there's a concern that while students and disabilities may trigger the identification.

04:23:19.085 --> 04:23:25.192
there's other causes there as well and other needs that obviously need to be addressed in order to support the work.

04:23:25.212 --> 04:23:27.575
So I thought, I think that's really important as well.

04:23:27.615 --> 04:23:38.848
So I guess in summarizing the idea of a coherent system as best we can, not missing the lowest performing schools as we try to blend the methodology to me is a really important approach to consider.

04:23:43.745 --> 04:23:48.448
So first, I just want to say thank you again to Cindy and Jenny, especially for all the work.

04:23:48.608 --> 04:23:55.692
If you read the information memo, as Kerry described it as dense, it was a very complicated process to put it together.

04:23:55.852 --> 04:24:03.096
And I really appreciate looking at it through the lens of LEAs, because that's the way we organize our schools in this state.

04:24:03.176 --> 04:24:08.339
And that's the level at which change has to occur to get to the student-centeredness.

04:24:09.199 --> 04:24:10.601
I really appreciate the approach.

04:24:11.361 --> 04:24:28.698
I just want to support Member Sun's suggestion, and I think that we can talk conceptually about which structure we want to use, the baseline, you know, option three or option two or whatever, for purposes of public comment, so people understand what the concept is.

04:24:29.418 --> 04:24:34.400
But in the absence of up-to-date data, we would be, it's a fool's errand in my view.

04:24:34.880 --> 04:24:41.702
And I think we've been trying at the state level to model this continuous improvement and learning from what we have.

04:24:42.142 --> 04:24:43.542
I'm not so sure the feds do.

04:24:44.863 --> 04:24:55.266
Just as your point earlier, I want to underscore President Kirst, that we had NCLB for 17 years with no changes or very modest changes.

04:24:56.626 --> 04:25:01.130
And we've made a commitment to be looking at our system all the time to be making changes.

04:25:01.190 --> 04:25:13.620
So I think to the extent we can build in any level of flexibility or any foreshadowing that we will be doing addendums, we will be doing amendments as we learn more, we should do that.

04:25:13.700 --> 04:25:18.965
We should not lock ourselves in to something that we can't change over time.

04:25:20.126 --> 04:25:25.572
The other thing, and this is building off Member Strauss, and certainly I really appreciate Member Sandoval's comments.

04:25:26.172 --> 04:25:30.898
In reading the letters, I was actually shocked by some of the letters that we got.

04:25:31.078 --> 04:25:37.305
That there seemed to have been a fundamental misunderstanding that because the funding formula

04:25:37.945 --> 04:25:42.228
is based on three groups for supplemental and concentration grants.

04:25:42.868 --> 04:25:47.531
Those same three groups are going to come out the other end for purposes of support and assistance.

04:25:47.931 --> 04:25:50.213
And if they didn't, then something's wrong with the system.

04:25:50.833 --> 04:26:00.059
But that ignores the fact that we're looking at all kinds of subgroups, up to 13 subgroups, any of which can either trigger the support and assistance.

04:26:00.679 --> 04:26:06.342
And as Member Sandoval eloquently said, many of which are represented in our students with disability group.

04:26:06.442 --> 04:26:06.582
So,

04:26:07.643 --> 04:26:13.506
Anyway, it just sort of made my head spin a little bit that there was, we just hadn't communicated that very well.

04:26:14.586 --> 04:26:23.790
And I think just to reinforce what Member Strauss said that eligibility for assistance does not limit the kind of assistance that you're going to be providing to the LEAs.

04:26:24.330 --> 04:26:34.016
as we talked a lot about in the last item, we hope to provide this assistance based on a very careful analysis of what the needs are at the LEA level.

04:26:34.356 --> 04:26:39.679
Again, to use Member Rucker's student-centeredness comment, that's what it will be based on.

04:26:39.719 --> 04:26:47.724
So this notion that somehow all the resources would be directed to one group, I just think sort of misses the mark.

04:26:47.764 --> 04:26:52.747
And I want to make sure that we all, at least me, understand that that's the intent behind this.

04:26:54.397 --> 04:26:55.518
Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

04:26:57.661 --> 04:26:58.021
Thank you.

04:26:58.041 --> 04:27:05.170
I understand how difficult it is to sometimes convey all information and your everyday conversations into a memo.

04:27:05.630 --> 04:27:09.174
And I have to say that I had to read the memo three times to get a better understanding.

04:27:09.294 --> 04:27:11.858
And I have like notes upon notes trying to connect.

04:27:12.378 --> 04:27:17.503
and identify the criteria for the first filter, then the second, and what the options were.

04:27:17.983 --> 04:27:29.954
So, you know, if we could just be a little bit more mindful, I'm in Sacramento, I'm here, and I still had to really read it over and over, and I think that people would have a hard time understanding what is actually being proposed.

04:27:30.635 --> 04:27:44.899
But once I got a better understanding of the material, I think that even if we try to delay the conversation because there's going to be additional indicators and more data, we're still going to wrestle with the same things that we had for the last two years.

04:27:45.320 --> 04:27:56.523
And so we could delay the conversation because there's going to be additional information, or we could really try to target and have a very intentional conversation about the areas where there's still misalignment, there's still confusion,

04:27:56.963 --> 04:28:03.907
and there's still a sense of vagueness about what is our capacity, what do we have to offer, how are we going to offer this.

04:28:05.108 --> 04:28:18.015
The proposal that we have now identifies, so there was the 181 plus a 25, and I do appreciate that we're looking at lowest performing schools that didn't fall within the targeted or the phase one LEA cohort.

04:28:18.675 --> 04:28:24.857
But if we identify LEAs based on LCFF, that's a one-year determination, so every year we'll be identifying them.

04:28:25.418 --> 04:28:32.760
If we identify them because a school triggered that identification, does that put them in a three-year timeline for identification?

04:28:32.840 --> 04:28:36.482
Because it was a school that triggered the identification under ESSA.

04:28:36.882 --> 04:28:39.503
So there's those differences in the timeline.

04:28:40.143 --> 04:28:47.966
There's also, and I do believe that we need an additional filter that does take into account the three student groups that are identified under LCFF.

04:28:48.346 --> 04:28:49.947
And I think option two allowed for that.

04:28:50.247 --> 04:28:55.009
So we still need to identify an additional 208 schools as of now that could change once we

04:28:55.849 --> 04:28:56.710
run the data again.

04:28:57.731 --> 04:29:02.457
But maybe a second filter would be looking through the three targeted LCFF subgroups.

04:29:03.578 --> 04:29:11.566
One more thing, I felt that we made a mistake by not pulling out ELA and math from the high school as a state indicator.

04:29:12.427 --> 04:29:24.510
having that embedded into the College Career Readiness Indicator, then sort of phased out the information or the identification of schools based on suspension and graduation and LPI, which doesn't apply to all students.

04:29:24.950 --> 04:29:29.571
So we started with two indicators, none of which are ELA or math.

04:29:30.452 --> 04:29:31.832
So I think that teasing those

04:29:32.492 --> 04:29:40.416
Those data points from the Career College Indicator would give us a better understanding and a better sense of how we could identify schools that are lowest performing.

04:29:40.876 --> 04:29:44.138
They're currently embedded into an index.

04:29:44.158 --> 04:29:46.239
And I know that there was some pushback a little bit.

04:29:46.259 --> 04:29:55.004
I felt that some of us wanted to make those state indicators, but then we went with putting them, embedding them into the College Career Readiness Index.

04:29:55.344 --> 04:29:59.066
And when I read this memo, it made me understand that that was a mistake that we made, in my opinion.

04:29:59.406 --> 04:29:59.666
Thank you.

04:30:01.269 --> 04:30:08.095
Kara, could you address the first thing on these different cycles of time for LCFF?

04:30:08.235 --> 04:30:19.567
And, you know, that's an, they would have to be, LCFF is identified, you know, on one cycle and the ESSA school's not.

04:30:20.468 --> 04:30:22.550
Can you, okay, legal question.

04:30:24.304 --> 04:30:25.485
It's not necessarily a legal question.

04:30:25.525 --> 04:30:28.347
David Sapp, Deputy Policy Director for the State Board of Education.

04:30:28.588 --> 04:30:39.777
So under the proposed approach, and this turns on what's also included as part of the recommendation and attachment to is the frequency for identifying schools under ESSA, the

04:30:40.397 --> 04:30:52.004
The recommendation and attachment to says to make it every three years to clarify that because the current draft was not specific as to it would be every three years necessarily.

04:30:52.524 --> 04:31:00.709
So if that is approved and basically it's saying you're only identifying the lowest performing schools every three years.

04:31:01.509 --> 04:31:16.173
So this additional criterion for pulling, you know, identifying an LEA that has one of those schools but isn't identified under LCFF, that would occur only every three years if we're identifying schools only every three years.

04:31:16.633 --> 04:31:25.515
We would still have under state law, the local control funding formula, the application of the criteria based on student group performance at the LEA level is annual.

04:31:26.315 --> 04:31:39.603
So you would basically have the annual application of the criteria that the board approved last September and then starting in 18 and then every three years after this additional look at districts that may have one of these low performing schools.

04:31:40.263 --> 04:31:41.164
I think that's one of the

04:31:41.864 --> 04:31:51.212
one of the challenges of this idea of identifying schools over time of, you know, do you do it once every three years and really focus the improvement resources?

04:31:51.652 --> 04:32:07.806
Do you do it more often, but then you have really diffuse in terms of what support is available, but then the overlay of, okay, what is, if we're focusing on districts as the, or LEAs as the way we support schools, it's gonna have to interact with our LEA-based accountability structure under state law.

04:32:08.246 --> 04:32:17.895
So, there are sort of two different cycles that we're talking about under this blended approach, the baseline methodology that's described in attachment to.

04:32:17.915 --> 04:32:20.197
The LCFF cycle is every year?

04:32:20.658 --> 04:32:20.958
Correct.

04:32:20.998 --> 04:32:21.919
Starting this fall.

04:32:29.207 --> 04:32:35.916
So when we have, so we will have one cohort every year and then we'll have another one every three years.

04:32:36.356 --> 04:32:41.563
And they will have, according to the recommendation, seven years to reach those state goals.

04:32:42.529 --> 04:32:47.074
Now, we'll identify every three years, they'll have seven years.

04:32:48.536 --> 04:32:50.638
We don't have a criteria to exit.

04:32:52.240 --> 04:32:53.822
Do we know what happens if they don't exit?

04:32:54.262 --> 04:32:55.544
Because I'm thinking capacity.

04:32:55.884 --> 04:32:59.188
So now we have one, three, so our capacity model will have to go.

04:32:59.588 --> 04:33:07.637
you know, at times it'll be that we'll have more capacity, other times we'll be stretched thin, and I have a hard time not putting all the system pieces together.

04:33:07.957 --> 04:33:19.009
And I think that when we do, and again, we could wait till we have other data, but these questions will still be the questions we're struggling with a year from now, six months from now, because we've been struggling them for two years.

04:33:19.069 --> 04:33:21.251
So, I want to make sure that we have

04:33:21.912 --> 04:33:30.520
that we're very aware of all of the details that this requires because we need to align this and we need to make sure that our schools are actually receiving support.

04:33:30.880 --> 04:33:47.115
In particular, if we're going to designate whether they're targeted or comprehensive, and I would like to see a designation in the dashboard, but if we're going to designate that they're receiving targeted or comprehensive, and we didn't speak much about targeted in the memo, then I think we owe it to them to actually give them support.

04:33:47.355 --> 04:33:48.276
And what does that look like?

04:33:49.873 --> 04:33:59.678
So to the question of the exit criteria, the May version of the plan that was what went out for public comment did include a section on the exit criteria.

04:33:59.959 --> 04:34:16.928
So there are specified exit criteria in the current draft that went out for public comment, which is the criteria that are ultimately used to identify the lowest 5% of schools or the school identification would be applied at the end of that period of time to see

04:34:17.688 --> 04:34:20.190
did they improve and get out of that sort of level of performance.

04:34:20.370 --> 04:34:23.492
So those are the current proposed criteria in the plan.

04:34:23.592 --> 04:34:27.856
I don't believe there's a recommendation to change that at this point.

04:34:28.376 --> 04:34:29.737
So those criteria would be applied.

04:34:29.757 --> 04:34:32.079
I think one challenge is we don't know

04:34:32.699 --> 04:34:37.901
what those criteria are because you need to determine what the initial identification criteria are in some way.

04:34:38.861 --> 04:34:43.762
So, but the sort of the basic structure, it was laid out in the draft plan.

04:34:43.802 --> 04:34:47.763
It's just we didn't have the specific identification criteria.

04:34:48.123 --> 04:34:54.645
And I think that's what the board is talking, you know, is grappling with right now about, okay, we have a baseline methodology, but what about the remaining 5%?

04:34:54.705 --> 04:35:00.027
Board Member Rocker.

04:35:01.576 --> 04:35:11.487
Okay, before I begin, I just wanted to ask, is the issue on the 95 percent participation rate part of the... Yes, that was part of, anything part of Carrick's presentation is what we're discussing now.

04:35:11.507 --> 04:35:16.112
Okay, so I want to start with that since we didn't have a lot of comment on that.

04:35:16.192 --> 04:35:20.677
I agree with the recommendation that the staff has made concerning the 95 percent.

04:35:21.678 --> 04:35:22.599
participation rate.

04:35:22.639 --> 04:35:34.875
In my time on the board, we have actually had LEAs come to the board with a waiver, begging forgiveness because they did not meet the 95% participation rate.

04:35:35.275 --> 04:35:40.702
And the reasons for not meeting the 95% participation rate is, as Carrick pointed out,

04:35:42.276 --> 04:35:47.781
an error on the part of the people responsible for administering the assessment plan.

04:35:48.401 --> 04:35:59.250
I'm only aware of, at the school level, only a few school sites that came into problems or encountered problems on the participation rate because of parent opt-out.

04:35:59.690 --> 04:36:10.539
And so the fact that we now have the flexibility to ensure that schools are not automatically sanctioned for the participation rate primarily because of parent opt-out, that's a wonderful thing.

04:36:11.119 --> 04:36:30.304
But the fact is we do have LEAs that abuse their authority and their flexibility about how they identify and assign students and move students around to avoid having to test them based on their subgroup or based on who they are or what their likelihood is to hold the school back in some way.

04:36:30.364 --> 04:36:38.326
So I think the flexibility to explore what exactly the 95% participation rate does or does not do

04:36:38.966 --> 04:36:42.048
in providing or identifying a sanction to the school is a good thing.

04:36:42.068 --> 04:36:45.530
So I do believe that the recommendation from the staff is important.

04:36:46.371 --> 04:37:01.921
Turning to the other areas, it's very hard not to talk about, to talk about just this item in a vacuum without reflecting back on the conversation we had with two other items we looked at on this board agenda already.

04:37:02.361 --> 04:37:16.310
today, particularly as relates to the system of support of prescribing that or even understanding how we're going to define some of the other elements in the criteria for our indicators in the LCFF.

04:37:16.711 --> 04:37:30.360
So I think I also agree with and understand Board Member Sun's recommendation about how to do the identification, but I also have the concern that remains that I expressed in May.

04:37:30.860 --> 04:37:32.121
It is not enough

04:37:32.741 --> 04:37:57.058
to make sure that we are identifying the lowest-performing LEAs because the reality is we will miss districts who have high-flying, high-performing schools, but there will be pockets inside that same district where the school site itself is among the lowest-performing schools in the state.

04:37:57.598 --> 04:38:07.881
So if this recommendation is going to hold a district like that accountable for their failure, because that is not a successful district.

04:38:08.201 --> 04:38:10.342
That is a failing district.

04:38:10.562 --> 04:38:13.782
They're not failing because they don't have high achievement scores.

04:38:14.223 --> 04:38:26.606
They're failing because I'll be honest with you, they're engaging in very racist, very separatist policies that allows them to ignore the needs of the students at that very low performing school.

04:38:27.106 --> 04:38:38.662
So, if this accountability recommendation is going to capture that very bad and very racist practice to make sure that that does not continue, I wholeheartedly support that.

04:38:39.623 --> 04:38:40.445
That said,

04:38:42.324 --> 04:38:58.432
Let's be very clear, while we have had the single objective of creating a coherent, integrated accountability system, because of the different timelines, this is not going to be a single system.

04:38:59.841 --> 04:39:12.470
It is not going to create a great deal of coherence because if you're on one list because of the three-year identification and another list because of the year-to-year identification, that's not going to be very coherent.

04:39:13.411 --> 04:39:22.778
And the only reason it will be integrated is because there will be common data elements that contributed to the identification of schools.

04:39:22.818 --> 04:39:25.120
And I think, as Dr. Kearse has already pointed out,

04:39:25.740 --> 04:39:38.547
Over time, with the arc of information that we will continue to receive about schools and as our accountability system matures, there will clearly be trends of performance that emerge.

04:39:38.987 --> 04:39:46.832
And I actually believe over time that coherence is something that will happen more because of confluence.

04:39:46.872 --> 04:39:52.795
Those two data elements and those two trend lines will somehow down the road coalesce

04:39:53.195 --> 04:40:02.381
And we'll start seeing a subset of schools that appear regularly on both that three-year identification and the one-year identification.

04:40:02.722 --> 04:40:16.911
But let's be clear, what we are recommending with what we're hearing for the accountability system is not going to create the coherent integration that we say is our goal today.

04:40:17.031 --> 04:40:20.294
I think that that is something that will actually develop

04:40:20.754 --> 04:40:28.953
fully as the system itself matures over time, but that is actually not what will be implemented and be felt in the field.

04:40:31.431 --> 04:40:32.792
Yeah, Board Member Byrd.

04:40:33.052 --> 04:40:34.493
So what's the solution?

04:40:35.354 --> 04:40:43.499
Because if we want to maintain our principle, which I do desperately, I would ask for a waiver from this if I thought we could get away with it.

04:40:44.700 --> 04:40:48.222
But I think, so there's a couple of ways we could go about it, right?

04:40:48.282 --> 04:40:50.364
We could change state law.

04:40:50.724 --> 04:40:55.047
We could say state law, we're going to do it every three years, then we can make it coherent.

04:40:55.507 --> 04:41:02.573
We could ask for a waiver on the timeline if we thought it made more sense for us to go with our every year.

04:41:03.033 --> 04:41:04.794
So it's not insoluble.

04:41:04.874 --> 04:41:12.820
So I don't want, I think it'd be helpful not to, you know, perpetuate that we're going to have two systems just because we have separate timelines.

04:41:12.880 --> 04:41:18.305
So I'd like to know what your solution is, Kerrick and or Dave.

04:41:24.762 --> 04:41:34.808
While they're coming up and thinking about their solution, the point was made that for support, three years is a lot better than one year.

04:41:36.149 --> 04:41:44.154
So the idea that this is a federal problem, they seem to have it, in my early judgment, more right than we do.

04:41:45.655 --> 04:41:48.677
And so, you may want to propose a waiver, but I, you know.

04:41:50.078 --> 04:41:53.780
Well, David Sapp, State Board Deputy Policy Director.

04:41:53.860 --> 04:42:05.268
Again, I think, I would just caution, there's, we did get feedback actually from stakeholders in some of the letters that identifying only every three years, it's a point in time.

04:42:06.108 --> 04:42:14.114
And so, if you have volatility, you know, if you have a movement from year to year in terms of, you know, you drop just a little bit and then, you know, just because

04:42:14.854 --> 04:42:26.341
that year of identification influences who's identified for support within the cohort, and it might just be a function of which year the cycle is up and not necessarily where the support is most needed.

04:42:26.781 --> 04:42:32.084
I think that that's a tension even within the three-year cycle that, you know, and I think that

04:42:34.405 --> 04:42:46.230
We would have to talk about how one might propose or revise the plan to get at this proposal that Member Sun put forward about this is the basic approach.

04:42:46.891 --> 04:42:50.732
We're going to get more data in three months, flesh it out, submit a supplement.

04:42:50.752 --> 04:42:54.254
So the board would be able to consider the updated data in the January meeting.

04:42:55.274 --> 04:42:55.754
basically.

04:42:55.795 --> 04:43:02.639
And the policy decision isn't going to get any easier necessarily, but I do think it would provide more complete information.

04:43:03.139 --> 04:43:08.122
What it would also potentially allow us to do is get a better sense of the year-to-year.

04:43:08.142 --> 04:43:15.607
You know, what does it look like over time at the school level and to the point of is it, Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe, is it every three years?

04:43:16.487 --> 04:43:20.250
That's sort of the current recommendation with the additional

04:43:21.170 --> 04:43:33.253
more current data, multiple years of data, we may actually see that you could look every year at school sites and over a three-year window maybe get much closer to 5% just using the baseline methodology, for example.

04:43:34.033 --> 04:43:45.795
So I do think that the additional time and more complete data would give staff time to really work through those options and come back to the board, I think, with a more

04:43:48.997 --> 04:43:56.987
a more likely, accurate, and predictive picture of what is going to occur in fall of 18, it's still not going to look exactly like what will happen in fall of 18.

04:43:58.223 --> 04:44:01.587
Well, let me say on that based on what you said, David, if you don't mind.

04:44:02.027 --> 04:44:18.304
I think that the likelihood that there will be some common LEA names on both lists under the identification, under the state plan for ESSA and on the identification we will be doing this fall for the LCAP, it is very likely.

04:44:18.604 --> 04:44:21.246
that there will be some names that are common to both lists.

04:44:21.606 --> 04:44:31.512
And I think over time the differences between those two lists as the systems mature will probably create more likelihood that the two lists will look more similar.

04:44:32.032 --> 04:44:39.697
But I also think that the annual identification will also create volatility in the list itself from year to year.

04:44:40.137 --> 04:44:47.981
that there will be some districts that fall off the list just because I had a good year or some districts that will change.

04:44:48.241 --> 04:44:54.404
Because remember, one of those times when we do have that annual identification, we are going to be moving the ends.

04:44:54.444 --> 04:45:01.007
We are going to be making adjustments on the scale and on the cut points, particularly for the academic indicator.

04:45:01.307 --> 04:45:06.390
So that's going to create some change in that annual indicator, in that annual identification.

04:45:06.970 --> 04:45:25.363
Anyway, so I'm very comfortable with doing that, but I do think if we are going to try to create some coherence, particularly in the field, the identification timeline would go a long way to creating that coherence if they were closer together and how often or the period of identification.

04:45:26.365 --> 04:45:28.526
So, Carrick Ashley, Deputy Superintendent.

04:45:28.546 --> 04:45:30.987
So, thank you for those comments.

04:45:31.067 --> 04:45:34.328
And those comments, as you were speaking, I had a woke moment.

04:45:39.549 --> 04:45:49.533
That consistent with what President Kirst was saying at the very beginning of this item, in the state plan, I would suggest that we keep it with three years.

04:45:50.273 --> 04:45:55.200
We can always decide internally we want to look at it every year and we look at it every year.

04:45:55.540 --> 04:45:59.966
But if we put it in the state plan that it's every year, then that's what we're held accountable to.

04:45:59.986 --> 04:46:05.434
Okay, then Board Member Ortiz-Lacon and then Board Member Sun.

04:46:06.184 --> 04:46:27.523
Yeah, I also had, I don't know if I understood this correctly, I'm under the influence of Benadryl, but I understood that we are going to leave it to the LEAs to, because they have access to the 5x5 and they'll know what the long term, the timeline is, the state determined timeline and that goal that we determined, that they will set their own interim goals.

04:46:28.183 --> 04:46:31.585
And my question would be, where is this documented?

04:46:32.265 --> 04:46:37.988
How do stakeholders, educators, parents, students know what those goals are?

04:46:38.008 --> 04:46:43.311
I think that I want to trust that everybody obviously wants to narrow achievement gaps.

04:46:43.411 --> 04:46:45.212
I haven't seen evidence of that historically.

04:46:45.732 --> 04:46:50.715
But I would like to know if this is going to be a transparent process of accountability.

04:46:51.175 --> 04:46:54.177
If we're not setting those targets, then where are those targets?

04:46:55.097 --> 04:46:55.657
Where do we go?

04:46:55.737 --> 04:46:58.619
Where are those targets documented and those goals documented?

04:46:58.939 --> 04:47:00.040
And who's monitoring that?

04:47:00.200 --> 04:47:00.360
Right.

04:47:00.700 --> 04:47:05.683
So, we would expect that to be documented in their local control accountability plan.

04:47:06.084 --> 04:47:17.431
If we set a long-term goal, which is proposed today, and the timeline, local school districts can certainly do the math in terms of identifying what their goals is.

04:47:17.451 --> 04:47:19.292
The downside of us, we could certainly

04:47:20.609 --> 04:47:21.530
do that, math.

04:47:22.872 --> 04:47:30.781
But I think it was member Holiday that mentioned the last time we had this discussion that these are kids and not machines.

04:47:31.101 --> 04:47:35.126
They don't necessarily make the same progress every year, right?

04:47:37.228 --> 04:47:52.604
So leaving that, what that annual progress is toward the eventual goal, we would leave that to school districts and we assume that that would be documented in their, either their local accountability plan at the district level, perhaps a school plan at the local level.

04:47:53.712 --> 04:48:00.315
I don't have the templates in front of me to see exactly where and how that's also documented in the annual update.

04:48:00.715 --> 04:48:10.019
I assume that within those three years, that three year cycle, if the county offices see that year one, no progress, year two, minimal progress.

04:48:10.319 --> 04:48:11.620
Now we're halfway there.

04:48:12.780 --> 04:48:19.243
I'm just trying to understand who raises that flag and says, hey, you're actually halfway there and not there at all.

04:48:20.383 --> 04:48:20.964
Who does that?

04:48:24.091 --> 04:48:26.938
That's an expectation that happens at the local level.

04:48:27.379 --> 04:48:29.345
That's an expectation that happens at the school level.

04:48:29.693 --> 04:48:34.776
It happens at the district level and it happens with their local governing board as they approve that plan.

04:48:34.916 --> 04:48:40.459
And then in discussions, obviously, with the county office who eventually has to approve that plan.

04:48:40.539 --> 04:48:46.022
I think maybe we could come back to this because I don't think this relates directly to the plan, does it?

04:48:46.102 --> 04:48:49.184
I mean... It's the interim goals.

04:48:49.284 --> 04:48:51.065
Okay, you're right.

04:48:51.445 --> 04:48:55.907
The state could calculate it though, you say, and just distribute it to the local districts or not?

04:48:57.228 --> 04:48:59.110
I'm, you know, is that an option?

04:48:59.150 --> 04:49:00.491
I'm just trying to get the options down.

04:49:00.692 --> 04:49:00.892
Right.

04:49:00.932 --> 04:49:12.823
I think what we need to do is to provide some guidance to local school districts on how to do this, on how to put it in their plan, how to make the determination, how to measure it and respond to it.

04:49:13.044 --> 04:49:15.346
Not necessarily calculate the math for them.

04:49:15.566 --> 04:49:15.806
Yes.

04:49:16.046 --> 04:49:16.347
Okay.

04:49:16.427 --> 04:49:18.429
I was just trying to clarify.

04:49:20.189 --> 04:49:21.570
I kind of want more than guidance.

04:49:21.610 --> 04:49:29.776
I want an expectation because it's very clear that that's what it's intended under LCFF and under ESSA is to narrow achievement gaps.

04:49:29.816 --> 04:49:38.363
So just putting guidance out there doesn't tell people this is an expectation and part of the accountability and what we're looking for is exactly this.

04:49:38.743 --> 04:49:41.125
So I think that we need to strengthen the language around that.

04:49:41.526 --> 04:49:44.228
Okay, Board Member Sun.

04:49:45.074 --> 04:50:08.539
I just wanted to just add this in support of the timeline aspect of things too, is also the, for us not to make a hard decision yet on that additional step of identifying schools and getting more data is, we have the one year and we have the three year difference, but we also have small schools.

04:50:08.999 --> 04:50:10.560
And so when you're identifying schools,

04:50:11.872 --> 04:50:15.933
that is very, very volatile from year to year versus districts.

04:50:15.993 --> 04:50:19.254
That's a very different dynamic that's happening there.

04:50:19.354 --> 04:50:22.755
So we only have one year of data, some of which is very old.

04:50:23.155 --> 04:50:31.478
So giving us at least an additional cycle gives us a little better picture of that dynamic and how that plays into things.

04:50:31.518 --> 04:50:37.980
And then perhaps that would be a stronger recommendation from CDE at that point, once we know more.

04:50:38.891 --> 04:50:45.696
And the CDE has said that they're going to look particularly at small, at small districts as well in the LCFF.

04:50:45.756 --> 04:50:53.102
So, and how this bounces around and what that might mean for how we, you know, rethink at some point the color coding.

04:50:55.043 --> 04:50:56.084
Okay, any more on this?

04:50:56.144 --> 04:50:59.607
If not, we can go to the presentation by Tom Adams.

04:51:00.728 --> 04:51:01.588
So, let's see.

04:51:01.649 --> 04:51:03.730
I'm going to start here and go around that way.

04:51:03.950 --> 04:51:04.651
Start with Ting.

04:51:05.291 --> 04:51:05.992
Yeah, and then I'm,

04:51:07.983 --> 04:51:10.285
So, I'll call on everybody.

04:51:10.485 --> 04:51:16.230
Yeah, so consistent with that, LCFF should be the foundation of our approach to ESSA.

04:51:17.050 --> 04:51:24.015
It makes sense to me that we build the element of LCFF priority one relevant to teachers for our definition of ineffective teachers.

04:51:24.616 --> 04:51:36.705
I agree with the CE recommendation to look at additional information that it not be just one metric in that definition.

04:51:37.325 --> 04:51:51.636
We clarified in November, at our November 2016 meeting, the local indicator LCFF priority one does not apply to charter schools because the Williams requirement included the LCFF priority do not apply to charter.

04:51:51.676 --> 04:51:52.817
So what I would...

04:51:54.358 --> 04:52:04.325
I think it's important to approach ESSA and it's invalidating the charter law at each state.

04:52:04.825 --> 04:52:17.394
So I would like to include, in aligning with our state rules then, I would like to include those that apply to charter schools, including some of that credentialing flexibility.

04:52:17.434 --> 04:52:22.357
So I would like to plan revision in this section to clarify the definition of

04:52:22.797 --> 04:52:28.599
reporting approach that will account for statutory flexibility afforded charter schools under the state law.

04:52:30.240 --> 04:52:31.480
Under existing state law.

04:52:31.660 --> 04:52:32.821
Under existing state law.

04:52:33.181 --> 04:52:33.401
Right.

04:52:33.581 --> 04:52:34.481
To make sure it's aligned.

04:52:35.662 --> 04:52:38.163
Board Member Williams, do you want to comment on this?

04:52:40.184 --> 04:52:44.705
I'm counting on team to know exactly what needs to be done here and I support it.

04:52:44.725 --> 04:52:45.466
Okay.

04:52:45.606 --> 04:52:46.406
Board Member Sisson?

04:52:48.207 --> 04:52:48.687
No comment?

04:52:48.927 --> 04:52:49.247
Okay.

04:52:49.907 --> 04:52:51.888
Board Member Sandoval, do you want to comment on this?

04:52:53.749 --> 04:53:08.485
Board member holiday I would that's what I was Confused about before I was in the wrong section But that's exactly what I was going to talk about the issue with the charter school situation and providing that flexibility in here and the other thing is that

04:53:10.473 --> 04:53:20.656
Down the road, I do think that we need to be able to define more effectively and identify more effectively teachers who are not serving students well.

04:53:21.557 --> 04:53:27.999
And obviously, the word ineffective is meant to talk about teachers who are not serving students well.

04:53:28.259 --> 04:53:29.739
It's not just about credentialing.

04:53:29.899 --> 04:53:31.540
It's not just about teaching out of

04:53:32.140 --> 04:53:33.382
out of subject area.

04:53:33.462 --> 04:53:40.431
It's about not teaching well and identifying those teachers and providing them the support they need to be successful in the classroom.

04:53:40.751 --> 04:53:45.477
And I would hope that eventually down the road we would be able to address that more directly.

04:53:47.720 --> 04:53:48.041
Okay.

04:53:48.641 --> 04:53:49.823
Board member Rucker.

04:53:51.604 --> 04:53:59.587
Well, the assistant, the associate superintendent spoke a little bit about the transferability issue as he talked about Title IV.

04:53:59.627 --> 04:54:09.391
But as it relates to the part that Tom talked about, in Title II Part A, funds can be transferred out of Title II Part A as well and go someplace else.

04:54:09.991 --> 04:54:20.356
I'm not, and so even though it wasn't really addressed in the public comment, I wasn't clear what that decision or what is the recommendation about the use of those funds.

04:54:20.417 --> 04:54:25.819
Is there going to be any flexibility for LEAs to be allowed to transfer those funds?

04:54:26.199 --> 04:54:28.861
Is that some intent that's going to be looked at in there?

04:54:29.301 --> 04:54:32.704
And you're talking about Title II transferring out of Title II.

04:54:32.764 --> 04:54:41.711
Yes, transfer because the statute allows funds to be transferred out of Title II Part A and Title IV Part A. So I'm just talking about Title II right now.

04:54:42.151 --> 04:54:53.861
And so I want to be clear because there is flexibility to transfer those funds into Title I that has an impact on how much money we're actually sending out to schools either from the state if the state decides to do that

04:54:54.281 --> 04:54:57.582
or how much money LEAs then have to transfer around and move.

04:54:58.102 --> 04:55:13.886
The reason I'm also asking about that is as it relates to this section and dealing with access to teachers and writing up this part of the plan, there are some elements in Title I Part A concerning the required and allowed reservations for services for students experiencing homelessness,

04:55:14.246 --> 04:55:27.132
for children in local institutions, parent and family engagement, and equitable services for private schools that also has an impact on some of the doc statements that were made in the plan concerning access to teachers.

04:55:27.472 --> 04:55:39.857
Because for particularly for where it relates to the contracting with private schools, private schools can participate in training opportunities provided under Title II that the LEA is looking at.

04:55:39.877 --> 04:55:40.778
So I'm not clear

04:55:41.338 --> 04:55:46.401
how the movement or transfer of those funds and how the contracting with the schools would be laid out.

04:55:46.541 --> 04:56:04.571
Again, not something addressed in particular in the public comment, a highly technical element in our plan, but it has to be considered in order for me to understand whether or not the recommendations that were being made by staff are important and the right way to go.

04:56:05.131 --> 04:56:10.478
those particular things for me are germane to that decision and would inform that decision.

04:56:10.939 --> 04:56:21.012
The other piece that I wanted to talk about, again, not addressed in the public comment, but Title II Part B contains a lot of grants for a lot of different programs, and I'm not

04:56:21.172 --> 04:56:33.344
clear if the state has laid out in particularly well what the state's role will be in either administering those grants or helping LEAs to compete successfully for those grants.

04:56:33.744 --> 04:56:38.188
And so I think it's important for us to pay attention to that information as well.

04:56:38.248 --> 04:56:42.132
Again, not addressing the public comment, but it is a part of the state plan

04:56:42.512 --> 04:56:46.114
that I think does, I think that we should pay some attention to.

04:56:46.614 --> 04:56:57.580
And then finally, in Title 2, Part C, it says any programs implemented under this title becomes a mandatory subject of bargaining in California.

04:56:57.940 --> 04:57:06.845
So as it relates to Board Member Holliday's conversation about teacher effectiveness and teacher evaluation, that may be a conversation we want to have here,

04:57:07.225 --> 04:57:28.466
But any conversation we want to have about teacher evaluation becomes a mandatory subject of bargaining based on the requirements in Title 2, Part C. So we, so I'm actually glad that the plan chose not to drop, to walk into that particular topic or conversation because that's a different can of beans for us to look at particular, given the timeline we have right now.

04:57:30.488 --> 04:57:31.649
Board Member Martíza Khan.

04:57:32.898 --> 04:57:34.499
This is only effective educator?

04:57:34.539 --> 04:57:39.280
Yeah, this is Tom Adams' suggestion on... Sorry, Tom, you were like five hours ago.

04:57:39.300 --> 04:57:43.021
Okay.

04:57:43.041 --> 04:57:45.402
I'm like working in five minute increments.

04:57:46.783 --> 04:57:50.624
So no, I'm actually very interested in hearing the conversation and public comment on this topic.

04:57:50.824 --> 04:57:52.124
I don't have much to say now.

04:57:55.085 --> 04:57:56.086
I just had one question.

04:57:56.146 --> 04:58:02.468
We had some letters, Dr. Adams, on the issue of intern credentials and whether they should be

04:58:05.109 --> 04:58:13.514
And there were some letters on public, in our public, not in our public comment, but in our letters about whether that should be considered ineffective.

04:58:13.554 --> 04:58:17.036
Did you weigh any of that in the consideration when you developed this part?

04:58:17.622 --> 04:58:20.923
Yeah, well, okay, let that be and then I'll make my comment and then I'll answer them all.

04:58:21.163 --> 04:58:21.423
Okay?

04:58:21.643 --> 04:58:21.823
Okay.

04:58:22.083 --> 04:58:24.244
Yeah, so I hope you're cataloging these, right?

04:58:25.124 --> 04:58:28.345
And so that you answer them all at once.

04:58:29.465 --> 04:58:35.647
So we did get letters suggesting other criteria for ineffective teachers such as

04:58:36.287 --> 04:58:38.608
teacher turnover, teacher absence.

04:58:39.689 --> 04:58:45.392
And we really don't have any statewide data on those things.

04:58:46.513 --> 04:58:48.754
And so we're facing a September deadline.

04:58:49.434 --> 04:58:55.278
And even though those are interesting, there's no ability for us to propose those in the plan.

04:58:56.338 --> 04:59:02.260
Moreover, some of them raised some questions about privacy issues.

04:59:02.340 --> 04:59:05.101
We'd have to get into how many times you're absent and so on.

04:59:05.181 --> 04:59:07.882
And it's a complex area.

04:59:08.302 --> 04:59:09.163
It's interesting.

04:59:09.923 --> 04:59:13.504
I think we would learn more from turnover and absence and so on.

04:59:13.544 --> 04:59:15.545
But it's coming very late in the process.

04:59:16.105 --> 04:59:19.146
So I don't see how we can do that in this plan.

04:59:20.087 --> 04:59:22.128
But I just wanted to register that.

04:59:23.408 --> 04:59:24.269
we're interested in.

04:59:24.289 --> 04:59:32.096
And it seems to me that California Teacher Commission might also have a role in collecting this data, since they collect a lot of this other data.

04:59:32.616 --> 04:59:35.739
So it might be more in their ballpark.

04:59:35.819 --> 04:59:38.862
So that's my only comment.

04:59:40.763 --> 04:59:52.466
on this particular, on the ineffective teacher issue, other than I'm not sure I want to turn over a robust definition of ineffective teacher into the federal government in a contract at this point.

04:59:52.566 --> 04:59:58.027
Some states went down that road with waivers and some of them weren't happy with where they ended up at the end.

04:59:58.107 --> 05:00:01.488
So, with the federal monitoring on that issue.

05:00:01.568 --> 05:00:03.248
So, Tom, can you comment on that?

05:00:04.069 --> 05:00:05.909
We raised several different questions here.

05:00:11.397 --> 05:00:12.938
So, is this on?

05:00:13.598 --> 05:00:17.640
So, Tom Adams, Deputy Superintendent and also Mr. Ineffective.

05:00:20.842 --> 05:00:33.789
No, to get back to this question of the intern credential, the distinction between the intern credential and the emergency credential as we lay out there is that there is actually an intent and you're actually in a program.

05:00:34.489 --> 05:00:40.612
And so it's usually district or university program that you're in.

05:00:40.652 --> 05:00:41.933
That's why we pull that out.

05:00:43.093 --> 05:00:50.717
And that was, you know, so there's, it's not just someone there, warm body who's taken the CBES and has an emergency permit.

05:00:50.737 --> 05:00:52.058
So that's why we pull that out.

05:00:53.819 --> 05:01:09.192
So, and we don't necessarily consider that ineffective just because there is a program in place and there is progress to be made, but we will still count it as a separate category.

05:01:10.333 --> 05:01:11.974
So, and then

05:01:16.104 --> 05:01:21.766
Patricia Rucker, board member Rucker, to all of your questions, yes.

05:01:30.167 --> 05:01:41.450
No, I mean, you just raised... I can't follow your answer until you, you got to help me with part A, part B, part C. Yeah, so, I mean...

05:01:43.467 --> 05:01:50.095
So first of all, thank you for pointing out the Title 2C in terms of other states.

05:01:50.255 --> 05:01:54.019
And Part 2, Part C, go over A, B, C. What are those?

05:01:54.460 --> 05:01:55.180
What are those three?

05:01:55.561 --> 05:01:56.842
I don't, I can't remember.

05:01:57.263 --> 05:01:58.864
And they're obviously, go ahead.

05:01:58.884 --> 05:02:01.427
So Title 2 Part A is what we talked about today.

05:02:02.628 --> 05:02:06.950
And that's really about getting into the system of support and what we want to do.

05:02:07.031 --> 05:02:20.437
Remember, the ineffective teacher definition is actually under Title I. Okay, so then it's this issue about that came out about the charter schools.

05:02:21.558 --> 05:02:31.223
What I'm hearing from you, and I just want to make sure this is clear, is that the federal law does not put any more requirements on charters than state law does.

05:02:32.043 --> 05:02:32.403
Correct?

05:02:33.304 --> 05:02:33.624
Okay.

05:02:33.704 --> 05:02:41.149
And then on Title 2B, in terms of those various... What does that do?

05:02:41.949 --> 05:02:53.897
Okay, so as board member Rucker pointed out, Title 2B does list a number of certain programs and what she wanted to know was what is going to be the state's role.

05:02:55.518 --> 05:03:00.664
That is, to be honest, I don't have a ready answer today.

05:03:01.405 --> 05:03:10.616
I mean, we will clarify that before the September meeting and we will talk with the board staff about this, but I don't have a ready answer today on that.

05:03:10.836 --> 05:03:20.023
Well, and the main reason I'm asking that is because we're about to do an adoption on history, social science, and one of the grants that are available concerns civic education.

05:03:20.403 --> 05:03:27.829
It's an opportunity to fund and support the rollout and implementation of this new adoption, possibly as this process goes forward.

05:03:27.869 --> 05:03:34.214
And it's important to think that through and not ignore that opportunity or to make sure we facilitate that opportunity.

05:03:34.614 --> 05:03:35.974
for our LEAs as well.

05:03:36.014 --> 05:03:37.635
So that's the reason why I asked about it.

05:03:37.875 --> 05:03:46.837
Because there are a lot of different grants that are, but they are competitive grants and our locals might need help to apply for some of those things if the state is not going to apply for them.

05:03:47.237 --> 05:03:47.457
Right.

05:03:47.557 --> 05:03:47.817
Okay.

05:03:47.877 --> 05:03:50.438
I see your point there and definitely well taken.

05:03:52.378 --> 05:04:02.741
Part C. Part C. Whether the issue of being subject, if we go further on it and the idea of it being subject to collective bargaining.

05:04:03.854 --> 05:04:15.723
Part C. Title II Part C specifically says that any program implemented under this title, meaning under Title II, would be subject to the collective bargaining requirement in that state.

05:04:15.743 --> 05:04:18.945
If the state has a collective bargaining law and in California we do.

05:04:19.166 --> 05:04:20.627
Okay, that's in the federal law.

05:04:20.687 --> 05:04:21.788
That's in the federal law.

05:04:23.169 --> 05:04:23.329
So.

05:04:25.285 --> 05:04:25.905
I'm not sure.

05:04:26.166 --> 05:04:27.546
I mean, you're making a point.

05:04:27.827 --> 05:04:28.607
That's what's there.

05:04:29.267 --> 05:04:39.534
Well, the reason I was making the point is because before me, board member Holliday spoke to the fact that the definition of ineffective teaching is ultimately about teacher evaluation.

05:04:39.914 --> 05:04:46.038
And at some point down the road, we, meaning this dais, should be walking into that conversation.

05:04:46.898 --> 05:04:57.101
I'm glad, and I was saying that to make the point, I'm glad we chose not to do that in this plan because in our state, teacher evaluation is a mandatory subject of bargaining.

05:04:57.441 --> 05:05:07.524
And given the timeline we have for submitting and approving the plan, that's not an opportunity that, that's not a conversation we can have in this forum with that requirement.

05:05:07.564 --> 05:05:08.864
That was the point I was trying to make.

05:05:09.524 --> 05:05:16.348
And my point earlier and pointing to greatness by design is we already have guidance for locals on that.

05:05:16.488 --> 05:05:22.572
We've produced a very good document that's well supported both in terms of research and educators.

05:05:22.592 --> 05:05:27.715
So why would we need to go further than that if we see it as primarily a local issue?

05:05:27.735 --> 05:05:32.898
Okay, I guess that, okay, now we're on to

05:05:34.011 --> 05:05:35.412
Title IV.

05:05:35.572 --> 05:05:38.414
And let's have people raise their hands.

05:05:38.475 --> 05:05:40.056
I'm not sure everybody wants to comment.

05:05:40.096 --> 05:05:40.976
Glenn, could you come up?

05:05:41.157 --> 05:05:41.497
Okay.

05:05:42.998 --> 05:05:50.504
So Board Member Holiday first and Board Member Williams and then I want to speak.

05:05:50.564 --> 05:05:50.904
Go ahead.

05:05:53.286 --> 05:05:54.087
Board Member Burr.

05:05:56.769 --> 05:05:57.109
I'm sorry.

05:05:57.149 --> 05:05:57.910
Did you call on me, sir?

05:05:58.090 --> 05:05:58.650
Yes, I did.

05:05:58.950 --> 05:06:01.332
So the recommendation

05:06:03.837 --> 05:06:14.625
Chief Deputy is to have a competitive process for the award of the funds.

05:06:14.746 --> 05:06:15.266
Is that correct?

05:06:15.546 --> 05:06:15.967
That's correct.

05:06:16.467 --> 05:06:29.117
And so do you have an idea about what percentage of LEAs would receive funding and what percentage would not based upon a competitive bid process?

05:06:30.151 --> 05:06:35.654
We haven't set the prioritization or the grant amount levels yet.

05:06:35.974 --> 05:06:39.836
And we haven't even played out really any scenarios yet on what that might be.

05:06:39.916 --> 05:06:41.697
So I couldn't answer that at this time.

05:06:44.478 --> 05:06:56.004
I do understand how a competitive bid process would potentially be a very effective use of the money for those schools who win in this process.

05:06:57.848 --> 05:07:07.354
no doubt had a bit more time or wherewithal to create a plan that would make the best use of those funds.

05:07:07.434 --> 05:07:21.262
But I do feel sorry for the school that has a group of students that they really need to help and that they won't get anything and they won't be a part of this.

05:07:23.503 --> 05:07:31.565
So I'm not really supporting the competitive process, but I'd be happy to hear more about it.

05:07:31.805 --> 05:07:35.185
Well, just to comment, Board Member Holliday, and I totally hear that.

05:07:35.205 --> 05:07:39.006
I think we probably all share that, those two different polls.

05:07:39.747 --> 05:07:44.888
One thing to keep in mind and was persuasive for me in thinking about the option two is that

05:07:45.368 --> 05:07:53.013
If we went with the formula allocation, the vast majority of LEAs in the state of California would receive a $10,000 formula allocation.

05:07:55.535 --> 05:07:57.856
Because there has to be a minimum grant size of $10,000.

05:07:58.356 --> 05:08:02.079
So, and not to sneeze at $10,000 at all.

05:08:02.159 --> 05:08:04.080
A lot of great things can be accomplished with $10,000.

05:08:04.880 --> 05:08:07.762
But some LEAs may consider it to be more hassle than it's worth.

05:08:09.023 --> 05:08:11.965
And it wouldn't spread very far in a lot of those districts.

05:08:13.752 --> 05:08:18.376
So that's, I think that's another factor to keep in mind as you're weighing that.

05:08:18.396 --> 05:08:20.177
Okay, who is next then?

05:08:21.558 --> 05:08:22.298
Board Member Williams.

05:08:23.659 --> 05:08:29.464
Could you put up the slide, please, that shows what it might go toward?

05:08:29.604 --> 05:08:30.484
Yeah, what it supports?

05:08:31.065 --> 05:08:32.686
Well, the one behind.

05:08:33.346 --> 05:08:34.447
No, you've already skipped over it.

05:08:34.587 --> 05:08:39.411
Oh, they're well-rounded education, safe and healthy students, effective use of technology.

05:08:39.818 --> 05:08:48.502
Right, and the further detail on that that I read was from the legislation under well-rounded educational opportunities.

05:08:48.542 --> 05:08:54.785
And these are also, the legislation also indicates, including but not limited to these items.

05:08:56.066 --> 05:09:11.265
guidance and counseling programs, music and arts program, STEM, including computer science subjects, accelerated learning programs, history, foreign language, environmental education, promoting volunteerism, and other activities that support a well-rounded education.

05:09:11.726 --> 05:09:12.928
That's well-rounded education.

05:09:13.788 --> 05:09:32.001
Safe and healthy students may include drug and violence prevention, school-based mental health services, supporting a healthy active lifestyle, preventing bullying and harassment, mentoring and school counseling, school dropout and reentry programs, and school-wide positive behavioral interventions and supports.

05:09:33.101 --> 05:09:45.268
And just again, at either an LEA level, if we do the formula allocation or the state level, if we do the competitive grant, we have to do at least 20% of the funds in each of those categories.

05:09:46.209 --> 05:09:50.931
And when you say LEA, does that include charters and districts?

05:09:51.391 --> 05:09:56.574
Would, if it was, if it was a formula, they would get $10,000?

05:09:56.614 --> 05:09:58.255
That's my understanding.

05:10:02.069 --> 05:10:18.040
So, I'm going to differ on from Member Holliday on this in the sense that I hear what you're saying and I hear, you know, $10,000 to everybody is, you know, is, you know, feels fair.

05:10:18.961 --> 05:10:29.788
On the other hand, it's especially for, in particular for a district, it could be, it could just be absorbed, you know, very quickly without it really having much of an impact.

05:10:30.708 --> 05:10:44.892
And while every single focus for this I think is important, which includes civic engagement kind of things, but also given that, you know, that I have worked on NGSS,

05:10:46.953 --> 05:10:48.093
now for a long time.

05:10:49.074 --> 05:10:55.135
That's a discipline that is still struggling because it was so very complicated.

05:10:55.175 --> 05:11:05.298
The conceptual shifts in NGSS were so very different and so very complicated that they're still, districts are still struggling to get all the professional development they need in that and to

05:11:06.719 --> 05:11:13.504
you know, to build it up so that they're ready when the state summative assessment becomes operational, which is just two years from now.

05:11:14.285 --> 05:11:20.950
And not to mention now we're going to start on computer science and so, you know, it would be terrific for any district that's interested in that.

05:11:21.110 --> 05:11:24.413
I'm just speaking from, you know, from the areas that I've been working in.

05:11:24.533 --> 05:11:31.619
Any district that would be interested in starting off on that, this could be very, or charter, this could be very helpful to them.

05:11:32.099 --> 05:11:33.681
I like the idea of competitive,

05:11:34.361 --> 05:11:52.214
competitive grants, this is such a small pot that there's something that when you have a chance to focus on something and get an application together and you say we've been wanting to do this for a long time, you know, now it's time for us to take care of this or this is an area we love and now we can spend this money on it.

05:11:52.394 --> 05:11:56.197
It has a way of focusing the effort.

05:11:56.837 --> 05:12:06.263
of an organization because they develop a plan, they go for it, they want it, they know what they're using it for, and it doesn't just sort of melt in with everything else.

05:12:06.303 --> 05:12:09.245
So I would support the competitive approach to it.

05:12:09.705 --> 05:12:16.789
There could be one option, and you tell me if this is an option, it could be that you could wait

05:12:18.830 --> 05:12:27.653
potentially weight, add a weight to the competitiveness of like how would you evaluate grants if you have more grant applications and money?

05:12:28.874 --> 05:12:43.719
One way would be to give extra weight to those serving the largest numbers of low-income kids or the three subgroups if that's a possible, a legal possibility to make sure that you're giving an extra boost for those districts or those charters.

05:12:44.414 --> 05:12:52.196
That, in fact, is a requirement is that some prioritization occur for service to low-income students and also geographic diversity.

05:12:52.756 --> 05:12:56.756
The State Education Agency and the board could also add another criteria that it would like to further.

05:12:56.796 --> 05:13:04.298
And one additional point, Board Member Williams, to your point is that LEAs can also come together as consortia under the competitive grant.

05:13:04.338 --> 05:13:10.079
If there were a number of LEAs that wanted to pursue a particular area of activity and support each other around that.

05:13:11.581 --> 05:13:12.566
Okay, who's next?

05:13:12.687 --> 05:13:14.697
Board... Oh, Patricia Rucker.

05:13:17.323 --> 05:13:30.375
Okay, so I agree with Board Member Holliday about not having the competitive grant, even though the minimum grant, even though it would mean that a minimum grant to a small LEA is only about $10,000.

05:13:31.336 --> 05:13:42.086
Competitive grants tend to favor urban districts and very large school districts and disproportionately cut out districts in geographically remote regions, even if you try

05:13:42.506 --> 05:13:47.468
to do the geographical spread, urban districts are favored in a competitive grant.

05:13:47.889 --> 05:13:49.349
But that's the first reason.

05:13:49.409 --> 05:14:00.775
But the second reason that I would prefer to make sure all LEAs get a piece because Title IV Part A funds, districts have the flexibility to transfer those funds

05:14:01.175 --> 05:14:02.756
into five other titles.

05:14:02.776 --> 05:14:26.216
They can transfer into Title 1A, Improving Basic Programs, Title 1D, Prevention and Intervention Programs for Serving Students Who Are at Risk, Title 2A, Supporting Effective Instruction, Title 3A, English Language Acquisition, Title 4, if they want to for Student Support and Academic Enrichment, or Title 5B, the Rural Education Initiative.

05:14:26.536 --> 05:14:42.543
So what it does in giving all of the districts a part of this money is it allows them to prioritize the use of those funds to any of the titles under ESSA and allows them to identify their local priorities.

05:14:42.903 --> 05:14:48.866
If we truly are going to create coherence in what we're doing to implement a school intervention program,

05:14:49.306 --> 05:15:12.608
then let's create and maximize the flexibility for the funding that passes through the state education agency and to the locals and allow them to use the funds to address their local priorities rather than have them chasing after money and creating a situation where truly most competitive grants will find us facing a situation where the money follows the student.

05:15:14.076 --> 05:15:15.757
Those points are really well taken.

05:15:15.797 --> 05:15:23.239
Just a quick comment to your first point on the urban districts being favored in a competitive grant situation.

05:15:23.799 --> 05:15:28.541
The way that under a formula that the funds would be distributed would be based on Title I allocations.

05:15:29.081 --> 05:15:32.162
So while the vast majority of districts would receive a $10,000 grant,

05:15:33.542 --> 05:15:38.445
those districts with large numbers of low-income students would receive larger amounts.

05:15:38.505 --> 05:15:40.226
So, the... Oh, I understand that.

05:15:40.266 --> 05:15:49.050
But at least if you give some to all districts, all districts are participating instead of having some districts who don't stand a snowball's chance.

05:15:51.284 --> 05:16:09.623
The, you know, I would, the snowballs transport, I think, could be mitigated by the SEA and the department by first adhering to the federal mandate that there be geographic diversity, but also building in requirements that certain amounts of the competitive grant be allocated to small and rural districts as a possibility.

05:16:10.504 --> 05:16:11.025
Board Member Burr.

05:16:11.719 --> 05:16:14.341
First, ditto to everything board member Rucker said.

05:16:14.901 --> 05:16:23.147
I don't support a grant program because I think of the competitive disadvantage to the majority of districts that would be looking at the money.

05:16:23.648 --> 05:16:27.050
And I just feel like this, it's a small amount of money overall.

05:16:27.170 --> 05:16:28.271
It's for one year.

05:16:28.531 --> 05:16:33.995
It's a lot of effort at the state level and at the local level to get a piddly amount of money.

05:16:34.715 --> 05:16:41.439
And it perpetuates categorical mentality instead of reinforcing LEA's priorities.

05:16:41.539 --> 05:16:43.800
So I don't support the competitive grant.

05:16:49.882 --> 05:16:58.812
I'm a little conflicted because I do think that when you have a competitive process, it allows you to really be methodical and think about what you're pitching.

05:16:59.793 --> 05:17:04.599
And it could serve as seed money since it's only one year to set something up and infrastructure for something.

05:17:05.860 --> 05:17:10.503
for additional funding that you could go on your own as a consortium or a school district.

05:17:11.004 --> 05:17:22.751
Maybe a hybrid, and I think you were alluding to that, where there is a set-aside that is guaranteed for smaller districts, where we know that there's going to be this amount given to small districts versus this amount that's given to larger districts.

05:17:23.712 --> 05:17:29.776
My question would be, that wasn't even my point, but I think that a competitive could be good.

05:17:29.936 --> 05:17:34.379
I think that we need to do some sort of a hybrid model where there is a set-aside for smaller districts or rural districts.

05:17:36.301 --> 05:17:54.721
But in looking at your priority areas here, the well-rounded, safe and healthy students and effective use of technology, and then I was looking at the areas of priority for the department and for the State Board, and one of the student groups that we mentioned, or we talked about early education and it's

05:17:55.342 --> 05:17:58.743
probably one of the first times that we've actually really given attention to early education.

05:17:59.863 --> 05:18:08.384
And so it says that we would prioritize underrepresented student groups, English learners, homeless youth, and that transition from early to primary grades.

05:18:08.825 --> 05:18:17.866
But I don't know exactly how that would fit under there because what you mentioned didn't seem to make a connection to this student population that we're hoping to engage.

05:18:18.146 --> 05:18:21.307
And I do think that we need to be more intentional

05:18:21.827 --> 05:18:27.209
about solidifying the pipeline because so much can be done if we just address the issue from the beginning.

05:18:27.749 --> 05:18:30.490
And, you know, meeting the needs of students from the beginning.

05:18:30.550 --> 05:18:35.592
And I want to make sure that I don't say issue because poverty is a challenge, but it's not a determining factor.

05:18:35.953 --> 05:18:42.335
And earlier the conversation almost hinted at that, that if we have poor districts, then automatically they're going to be failing districts.

05:18:42.715 --> 05:18:49.398
I think that if we have poor districts in terms of expectations, then we're going to, you know, have low performing districts, but

05:18:49.898 --> 05:18:53.340
Poverty is a challenge, it's not a determining factor.

05:18:53.880 --> 05:18:56.861
So I just want to point that out because that kind of came up in a previous conversation.

05:18:57.702 --> 05:19:07.106
But yes, how are we going to prioritize early education under those three buckets when what you outlined didn't really hint to early education?

05:19:09.749 --> 05:19:16.132
And those categories, if you will, or those priorities could be included as part of the RFA process.

05:19:17.732 --> 05:19:24.415
We'd be mandated as part of the RFA process to ensure geographic diversity and prioritization for low-income populations.

05:19:24.455 --> 05:19:25.936
That's a stipulation of the federal law.

05:19:26.376 --> 05:19:31.558
But we could also add in other state priorities such as the ones you mentioned as part of the RFA.

05:19:33.843 --> 05:19:35.705
OK, I guess I'm, pardon?

05:19:37.406 --> 05:19:43.311
OK, well, I'm going to inject mine then, because we're coming around, so I got to turn.

05:19:45.493 --> 05:19:49.376
Yeah, I really am not impressed by any of those.

05:19:51.357 --> 05:19:59.064
What happened here is the federal government had 20 or 30 categories, and they decided to consolidate the categories.

05:19:59.684 --> 05:20:02.266
And they chose these after some bargaining.

05:20:03.147 --> 05:20:12.074
So I would throw in an option three, which if you go back a slide, I think we could do, which is transfer this money.

05:20:14.195 --> 05:20:16.177
Well, yeah, no.

05:20:18.359 --> 05:20:28.406
both LEAs and state may transfer these funds to other titles, that we transfer these funds to Title III for English learners and Title II for teachers.

05:20:29.347 --> 05:20:32.309
And then you can do, and then we could discuss a grant.

05:20:32.489 --> 05:20:38.093
I think both of those are higher priority than these three, which we're not going to make any inroads on anyway.

05:20:38.433 --> 05:20:43.097
We don't really have any programs that we're reinforcing these with.

05:20:43.657 --> 05:20:44.538
You know, we don't have a

05:20:44.978 --> 05:20:48.719
well-rounded education, you know, thing that's in the general fund.

05:20:49.540 --> 05:20:58.102
So, you know, let me throw that out that we don't, why, why do we just go with their list that we had of consolidated things?

05:20:58.923 --> 05:21:04.264
And I think those, I don't know why they chose those at the federal level, but we don't have to choose them.

05:21:04.544 --> 05:21:06.105
So why not option three?

05:21:06.653 --> 05:21:08.355
Well, it's certainly an option to consider.

05:21:08.375 --> 05:21:19.385
Just one wrinkle to think about as you consider that, that may impact your thinking, President Kurtz, is that what the state can transfer into the other titles are the state level.

05:21:19.746 --> 05:21:20.827
Only the state level.

05:21:20.847 --> 05:21:22.408
We can't transfer the grant funds.

05:21:22.609 --> 05:21:22.749
No.

05:21:22.969 --> 05:21:29.075
So the LEAs, as Board Member Rucker mentioned, can transfer their funds to the titles that she enumerated.

05:21:30.097 --> 05:21:33.901
Well, we can only transfer the state level activities, the 1.8.

05:21:33.961 --> 05:21:41.869
Which is the reason why I'm recommending give the money to all the LEAs and let them transfer the money to where they want and choose the programs they want.

05:21:42.130 --> 05:21:44.332
That's the reason why I'm recommending give it to all the LEAs.

05:21:44.352 --> 05:21:45.033
Can we do that?

05:21:45.593 --> 05:21:45.853
Yes.

05:21:46.153 --> 05:21:46.334
Yeah.

05:21:46.394 --> 05:21:57.639
So the formula, if they transfer it to another title, let's say, for example, they transfer it to Title II, they'd have to use it in accordance with the Title II.

05:21:57.659 --> 05:22:03.843
If they didn't have the competitive grant, then they could transfer the funds.

05:22:03.883 --> 05:22:10.806
And if they choose to transfer their Title IV Part A funds into Title II and use it for professional development, they're allowed to do that.

05:22:10.846 --> 05:22:11.927
That's their choice then.

05:22:12.347 --> 05:22:14.231
So that's, in effect, an option three.

05:22:14.431 --> 05:22:19.741
Well, that's option one, make it a local, give it to everybody and let them choose what to do with it.

05:22:20.061 --> 05:22:21.865
Or option two, make the competitive grants.

05:22:23.789 --> 05:22:24.089
Okay.

05:22:24.109 --> 05:22:26.270
Now, Board Member Holland.

05:22:26.290 --> 05:22:39.877
And I think an individual standalone charter school is certainly at a disadvantage in this competitive process compared to, you know, a large CMO that has a number of charter schools.

05:22:39.957 --> 05:22:40.998
And that's a problem.

05:22:41.278 --> 05:22:44.880
And besides, I think we should continue to

05:22:47.761 --> 05:23:12.424
emphasize the importance of taking action against bullying and against these other and by sending money to each of the federal money to each of each school and saying here are the categories yes you may transfer into another title and that sort of thing but at the same time it does place emphasis on those key things and those are important and they may not be as important as

05:23:13.264 --> 05:23:19.689
some of the other priorities and there may not be a statewide process and program associated with them.

05:23:20.050 --> 05:23:31.138
But, you know, if I'm running a small school and I've got this funding and, you know, I've got some creative ideas about how to attack the bullying problem.

05:23:32.199 --> 05:23:33.680
I think I want the money.

05:23:33.700 --> 05:23:36.222
Board Member Sun.

05:23:36.844 --> 05:23:38.845
I just want to do a quick weigh in as well.

05:23:39.025 --> 05:23:47.050
I had struggled a little bit about these two different options, and I really lean towards giving it to the LEAs and to the schools.

05:23:47.410 --> 05:23:49.091
I think it gives them flexibility.

05:23:49.131 --> 05:23:57.897
It follows along the local control concept that we've been pushing and pushing, and it gives them more flexibility on how they want to utilize it.

05:23:58.017 --> 05:24:05.301
And it is a disadvantage to small districts and small schools with these types of competitive grants.

05:24:06.604 --> 05:24:07.445
Okay.

05:24:08.285 --> 05:24:10.447
Okay.

05:24:11.768 --> 05:24:19.114
And while I like a good competition by nature, I'm fine with that approach.

05:24:19.554 --> 05:24:23.317
Keeping in mind that they can keep it in Title IV.

05:24:24.398 --> 05:24:27.940
Some may choose to transfer it to other titles for some reason.

05:24:29.041 --> 05:24:34.946
But anyone that, any LEA that gets the funding can keep it in Title IV and choose to use it.

05:24:35.626 --> 05:24:53.831
even though the titles that you showed up there, the three categories are very broad, the kinds of things that you described as more detail examples of what could be included in there are all worth LEAs choosing something that correlates with those and putting that funding toward that.

05:24:53.851 --> 05:24:58.592
Board Member Sisson.

05:25:00.578 --> 05:25:05.822
I just had a question about the two options for the grants.

05:25:06.122 --> 05:25:12.846
So for option one, for example, it says that we can spend no more than 15% on technology infrastructure.

05:25:12.967 --> 05:25:25.095
And I was just wondering, I think that the issue of technology infrastructure in different LEAs is such a crucial problem because there's just so many differences between certain schools and certain school districts.

05:25:25.295 --> 05:25:26.996
And I think that 15% on option one and even the 25% on option two

05:25:31.019 --> 05:25:42.147
I think that if LEA needs to spend that money to up that infrastructure, especially if they're at a deficit right now, I'm not sure why it's limited at that percentage.

05:25:42.187 --> 05:25:48.692
Is there a reason why they can't spend more than that, especially if, I mean, with the $10,000 minimum grant money, that's not even

05:25:49.332 --> 05:25:52.974
It's only $1,500 for technology infrastructure at that point.

05:25:53.134 --> 05:25:57.317
So I don't know exactly how much you can even do with that.

05:25:58.038 --> 05:26:00.059
So is there a reason why it's so low for that one?

05:26:02.736 --> 05:26:07.600
It basically comes from, those percentages do not come from us, they come from the feds.

05:26:07.840 --> 05:26:16.488
So, you know, I'm assuming that it's the intent that the funding be spent on services to students as opposed to hardware and infrastructure.

05:26:16.988 --> 05:26:19.811
But we'd have to ask the Department of Education and Congress.

05:26:20.296 --> 05:26:21.257
Okay, we need a break.

05:26:21.437 --> 05:26:32.886
And what I want you to think out over the break, because we're going to take public comment, is if we go the route of sending the money down, what do we do with the state administrative money?

05:26:32.906 --> 05:26:37.849
Because you don't need all that money to crank the numbers through your checking operation.

05:26:38.390 --> 05:26:40.651
So let's talk about that when you come back.

05:26:40.952 --> 05:26:47.577
We might transfer that somewhere and put it in, say, the Title II pot for leadership, or I don't know.

05:26:48.317 --> 05:26:53.780
We will give you a chart that shows where that those funds can be transferred over the break.

05:26:54.220 --> 05:26:55.080
Okay, thank you.

05:26:56.301 --> 05:27:02.143
Now we're breaking and we will come back at 20 of three and take public comment.

05:27:05.705 --> 05:27:14.069
Okay, the State Board will reconvene and we'll call the roll if you're... We're calling the roll for public comment.

05:27:17.492 --> 05:27:21.336
Go ahead, call the roll immediately.

05:27:41.363 --> 05:27:43.284
Would the following people please line up?

05:27:44.084 --> 05:28:08.853
Fidelio Morales, Esther Corrubias, Semais Morales, Janice Ray, Anthony Caro, Ifeany Onobags, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz, Marsha Turner, Carling Aguilera-Fort, Lynn Ayohe, Vicky Ramos-Harris, Shelly Spiegel-Coleman,

05:28:10.006 --> 05:28:25.034
Lane Olson and Judy O'Halloran, Martha Hernandez, Michelle Sotopena, Maria, Tony and Liz, Doug McRae and Roberto Baramontes.

05:28:25.194 --> 05:28:26.614
And I'll call more in a moment.

05:28:27.035 --> 05:28:27.335
Okay.

05:28:27.535 --> 05:28:28.235
Come up, please.

05:28:28.756 --> 05:28:29.416
First person.

05:28:36.903 --> 05:28:37.264
Go ahead.

05:28:37.384 --> 05:28:37.905
Microphone.

05:28:59.827 --> 05:29:00.868
Does this one work?

05:29:01.068 --> 05:29:01.568
OK, great.

05:29:01.989 --> 05:29:02.789
Hi.

05:29:02.829 --> 05:29:05.711
My name is Jafet Diego, and I'm here from Parent Revolution.

05:29:05.812 --> 05:29:08.313
And I'm actually going to be translating for our parents today.

05:29:08.373 --> 05:29:09.694
So I'm just here to translate.

05:29:11.035 --> 05:29:11.756
Buenas tardes.

05:29:11.776 --> 05:29:13.157
Mi nombre es Fidelia Moraes.

05:29:13.337 --> 05:29:15.219
Vengo del subcentro de Los Angeles.

05:29:17.560 --> 05:29:18.301
Good afternoon.

05:29:18.361 --> 05:29:23.485
My name is Fidelia Moraes, and I'm coming from South Central LA.

05:29:25.202 --> 05:29:29.944
Y estoy representando a los padres de la ley de empoderamiento de padres.

05:29:30.764 --> 05:29:34.005
And I am here representing the families from the Parent Power Network.

05:29:35.485 --> 05:29:37.786
Decidí venir hasta Sacramento por un motivo.

05:29:38.186 --> 05:29:41.848
Me interesa el tema de la educación de los niños.

05:29:41.868 --> 05:29:44.448
I decided to come to Sacramento for a reason.

05:29:45.389 --> 05:29:48.890
That is because I believe that the education of our children is important.

05:29:50.754 --> 05:30:03.577
Soy una de las madres que tiene una historia triste a la vez porque tengo dos hijos, los cuales... I am a mother that has a sad story.

05:30:03.597 --> 05:30:19.061
I have two sons that... El más grande llegó hasta sexto grado sin reclasificar, pasó hasta el grado ocho sin reclasificar y como era mi primer hijo yo no sabía lo importante que era reclasificar.

05:30:20.576 --> 05:30:26.623
The eldest one went to sixth grade and was not reclassified from being an English language learner.

05:30:27.144 --> 05:30:29.927
And he continued as that until eighth grade.

05:30:30.028 --> 05:30:31.569
And she didn't know what was going on.

05:30:32.677 --> 05:30:41.700
When he was in ninth grade, that's when I made the decision to switch him to another school because they had told me that if he continued that way, he wasn't going to be able to go to college.

05:30:58.424 --> 05:31:04.247
So instead, they taught him a craft as a gardener so that he would know how to defend himself.

05:31:04.787 --> 05:31:09.789
After 23 years, I had my second child attending the same school, and this time I was more attentive.

05:31:23.755 --> 05:31:28.768
She involved herself in the parent engagement at her school.

05:31:28.848 --> 05:31:32.176
Yeah, parent engagement in the school.

05:31:33.234 --> 05:31:44.183
Yeah, advisory council.

05:31:45.945 --> 05:31:50.348
In the second grade, he reclassified from being an English language learner.

05:31:50.789 --> 05:31:56.713
But then to her surprise, as he was in fifth grade, he had gotten an award in math.

05:31:56.874 --> 05:31:59.536
And so she took him to get a pizza party.

05:31:59.556 --> 05:32:01.617
And it was to her surprise that

05:32:02.654 --> 05:32:07.238
And so he showed her what this test was, and it was multiplication, two times two, three times three.

05:32:07.358 --> 05:32:11.521
And it was to her surprise that that was what the award had been, even though he was in fifth grade.

05:32:11.581 --> 05:32:12.562
And so she felt disappointed.

05:32:34.977 --> 05:32:43.340
Because those were skills that he learned in second grade, and so it was to his surprise that he was still getting that same test in fifth grade.

05:32:43.360 --> 05:32:47.462
I went and talked to the principal, and I told him that it was a joke for my son.

05:32:47.502 --> 05:32:51.144
He told me that he didn't know that the teachers had given him that exam.

05:32:52.384 --> 05:32:57.269
So she went to go speak to the school principal and told her how disappointed she was.

05:32:57.869 --> 05:33:04.296
And he said that he wasn't aware that the teacher had given that test to her son.

05:33:05.257 --> 05:33:07.779
But for her, she felt just really disappointed.

05:33:09.120 --> 05:33:15.902
So then she was advised to... So then he was changed to have another teacher, and so he started getting fours and threes.

05:33:36.991 --> 05:33:41.674
But then when she changed him over to a charter school, she realized that he wasn't doing as well as she thought he was doing.

05:33:41.694 --> 05:33:43.235
And so again, the disappointment of finding that out.

05:33:43.275 --> 05:33:46.136
So they accepted him into the charter school because he had high grades.

05:34:06.656 --> 05:34:09.457
Yo no quiero que siga pasando esto con los niños de mi comunidad.

05:34:09.657 --> 05:34:15.300
Que haya una acción y una solución de que las escuelas van a estar bien.

05:34:16.241 --> 05:34:19.802
So she doesn't want this to continue to happen to other kids in her community.

05:34:19.882 --> 05:34:27.906
She wants to make sure that there is a plan where there is an improvement so that kids aren't, that more kids aren't going through this.

05:34:28.446 --> 05:34:35.230
Que no solo se mire que la escuela está baja, sino que les den un procedimiento y que vean que si la escuela está avanzando.

05:34:36.110 --> 05:34:47.858
So she wants to make sure that there is some sort of measurement so that we know which schools are low performing and that there is some sort of plan of action to see that they are actually improving.

05:34:55.643 --> 05:35:02.848
She no longer has any of her children in district schools, but she is very concerned for the other kids in the community and that's why she's involved.

05:35:03.368 --> 05:35:03.729
Time, thank you.

05:35:39.079 --> 05:35:40.440
Good afternoon, board members.

05:35:40.700 --> 05:35:46.484
My name is Esther Covarrubias and I have one son, Armani, who goes to a Head Start program in the area of Compton.

05:36:02.523 --> 05:36:06.185
Today I am here representing the families of Compton and the Parent Power Network.

05:36:19.781 --> 05:36:28.287
I decided to come to Sacramento because we need the state to design a strong ESSA plan that will improve the lowest 5% of schools in California.

05:36:28.748 --> 05:36:33.211
These schools have been low performing under the old system and now under the new dashboard.

05:36:34.252 --> 05:36:42.198
Yo emigré a este país a los 12 años y entré como estudiante de aprendiz de inglés a Washington Middle School y después a Long Beach Polytechnic High School.

05:36:43.502 --> 05:36:52.268
I immigrated to this country when I was 12 years old and was classified as an ESL student at Washington Middle School and then at Polytechnic High School in Long Beach.

05:36:53.329 --> 05:36:55.811
I graduated from Washington Middle School without being reclassified.

05:36:55.831 --> 05:37:00.114
Neither my parents nor I were informed that I had not been reclassified.

05:37:11.972 --> 05:37:19.064
Yo viví lo que es estar estudiando en una escuela de bajo rendimiento y donde los adultos tienen bajas expectativas para algunos estudiantes.

05:37:20.109 --> 05:37:28.655
I experienced firsthand what it felt like to be a student in a low-performing school and to have adults that had low expectations of some students.

05:37:44.446 --> 05:37:51.328
Year after year, I was passed from one grade to the next instead of receiving an intervention and being asked what kind of support I needed.

05:37:51.868 --> 05:37:53.589
The expectations in school were low.

05:37:53.949 --> 05:38:00.791
And even though I came from another country with the dream of being a criminologist, I never received the support I needed to be proficient in English.

05:38:02.552 --> 05:38:10.935
Mi hermano pequeño fue a la misma escuela y tuvo la suerte de tener un maestro que le recomendó a mis padres que optaran por una mejor escuela aunque estuviera fuera del área.

05:38:12.788 --> 05:38:22.095
My younger brother attended the same school but was lucky to have a teacher that recommended that my parents move him to a better school even if it was not in the area.

05:38:27.179 --> 05:38:33.001
With the hope that my brother would have better opportunities outside of our area, my parents decided to send him on the bus to a public school in Palos Verdes, California.

05:38:50.848 --> 05:38:59.832
It is because of my brother that I am here today to let you know that there are large differences in the quality of public education depending on the area that you live in.

05:39:11.934 --> 05:39:15.638
Right now I live in Compton and there are a few high performing schools.

05:39:16.238 --> 05:39:21.863
I want my son Armani to have better opportunities than what the public school system gave me when I was a student.

05:39:41.205 --> 05:39:45.854
I ask myself, how is it possible that our state lets students graduate?

05:39:46.735 --> 05:39:47.477
Thank you for your time.

05:40:02.498 --> 05:40:05.601
Good afternoon board members of the board.

05:40:05.881 --> 05:40:11.006
My name is Tamayez Moraes and I am a 6th grader at No Design Starter School in South Los Angeles.

05:40:11.446 --> 05:40:15.289
I'm the youngest of four kids and we all attended 20th Street Elementary.

05:40:15.690 --> 05:40:21.595
This is a local elementary school and it needs a lot of help because too many kids are behind in English and math.

05:40:24.941 --> 05:40:31.645
I am here today to share with you my experience as a student attending a school that needs an emergency plan of action to improve.

05:40:32.385 --> 05:40:34.327
I knew that something was wrong at 20th Street.

05:40:35.027 --> 05:40:42.231
Some teachers went the extra mile to ensure that we had more activities like PE and library time.

05:40:42.511 --> 05:40:44.152
Not all of my teachers were like that.

05:40:44.673 --> 05:40:46.634
Some of my teachers didn't really believe in us.

05:40:50.717 --> 05:40:54.099
But I knew that I could do the work if I got a chance.

05:40:54.560 --> 05:40:56.421
I don't know why our principal changed so much.

05:40:56.901 --> 05:41:00.484
I don't know why I was giving tests on things we had never learned.

05:41:00.924 --> 05:41:05.147
I don't know why I kept getting the same math homework in fifth grade that I got in second grade.

05:41:05.707 --> 05:41:12.752
I do know that I am lucky that my mom is stubborn and persistent and not afraid to speak for me.

05:41:13.232 --> 05:41:20.497
But when my mom and other parents started to speak up I heard teachers say that I was placed in a different class because my mom will complain.

05:41:21.338 --> 05:41:22.419
I always get my chin up.

05:41:22.759 --> 05:41:24.141
I knew there was a finish line.

05:41:24.702 --> 05:41:27.085
But my experience at 20th is not uncommon.

05:41:28.366 --> 05:41:29.988
Today I wake up at 6 a.m.

05:41:30.328 --> 05:41:32.991
take the city bus to go to a public charter middle school.

05:41:33.392 --> 05:41:38.558
It's hard to realize that I was advanced at 20th and now I am not at grade level.

05:41:39.039 --> 05:41:40.861
It isn't fair that students like me

05:41:41.581 --> 05:41:44.683
need a lot of help because we're not taught the basics.

05:41:45.183 --> 05:41:50.505
I know I have to work extra hard to learn the things I was supposed to learn at 20th.

05:41:51.045 --> 05:42:02.311
My dream is to one day be governor of California and I will work hard to get to a university but it is frustrating and hard when you're missing the basics.

05:42:02.791 --> 05:42:09.594
My mom makes a lot of sacrifices to make sure I get extra tutoring but I'm lucky many parents can't pay more money to do this.

05:42:10.254 --> 05:42:13.096
I'm here today to ask you to put yourself in our shoes.

05:42:14.297 --> 05:42:19.300
There needs to be a plan A plan B and a plan C to make sure schools get better.

05:42:19.960 --> 05:42:22.602
Too many students like me are doing our part.

05:42:22.922 --> 05:42:24.483
Now we need your help.

05:42:24.864 --> 05:42:25.184
Thank you.

05:42:36.769 --> 05:42:38.450
Hello my name is Janice Ray.

05:42:39.070 --> 05:42:40.871
I was born and raised in Richmond California.

05:42:40.891 --> 05:42:46.934
I am a student, a mother, a member of Students for Education Reform and here to support Parent Revolution.

05:42:46.954 --> 05:42:55.238
I would like to urge the members of the board to provide a transparent and easy to understand structure on how we will proceed with change.

05:42:55.779 --> 05:42:59.801
I am here not as a victim but a product of our school system failing our children.

05:43:00.561 --> 05:43:04.463
I have a learning disability and I didn't learn how to read until I was in the sixth grade.

05:43:04.964 --> 05:43:06.124
My teachers had failed me.

05:43:06.645 --> 05:43:11.507
A woman by the name of Sue Luterman instructed me to play games on her personal laptop.

05:43:12.008 --> 05:43:14.769
Unaware at the time I was learning intrinsically.

05:43:15.410 --> 05:43:23.855
Growing up my maternal grandmother who had a second grade education I bared the responsibility of filling out applications and money orders to pay rent.

05:43:24.355 --> 05:43:26.136
By age 13 I was misplaced.

05:43:26.716 --> 05:43:29.618
Although I was homeless I still graduated.

05:43:35.057 --> 05:43:43.063
I asked, if you could have met me at age 11 knowing that I couldn't read, would you have encouraged me to stay in school with the hopes that I would become something in life?

05:43:43.543 --> 05:43:47.006
After all, how else can we break the cycle of poverty stricken children?

05:43:47.506 --> 05:43:51.550
I currently volunteer for 10 Books a Home that helps kids learn through play.

05:43:51.970 --> 05:43:54.051
These matters don't just affect my community.

05:43:54.432 --> 05:43:58.995
They affect the many people who can personally relate to their education system failing them.

05:43:59.616 --> 05:44:03.879
What part of my future is supposed to be determined by my family's income?

05:44:04.594 --> 05:44:10.940
I am here to hold everyone accountable who has the power to implement change for their procrastination.

05:44:11.421 --> 05:44:17.267
You are now forced to deal with your lack of action that intentionally tries to set our children up for failure.

05:44:17.787 --> 05:44:24.834
What can you say to that little girl who was not able to read in the sixth grade because she was not made up but present today?

05:44:25.905 --> 05:44:37.496
I ask for you all to have a clear menu of action for each district to be required to address low-performing schools that does not meet their improvement target within two to three years.

05:44:37.996 --> 05:44:45.683
I look forward to meeting with you all again with the hopes that next time the children at Ravenswood School District will be set up for success and not failure.

05:44:46.044 --> 05:44:46.384
Thank you.

05:44:59.807 --> 05:45:01.589
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen of the board.

05:45:01.709 --> 05:45:03.171
My name is Ifeanyi Onobogo.

05:45:03.611 --> 05:45:11.620
I'm currently a student at San Jose State University, a representative of ESFER, Students for Educational Reform, and a supporter of Parent Revolution.

05:45:15.038 --> 05:45:29.731
Standing here in front of you, I know from my life experiences and the fact that I'm here in front of you addressing this board, I know that a child does not choose where they're born, but has the opportunity to identify or plot their destiny.

05:45:30.352 --> 05:45:37.559
And it's not fair that these children, that the educational system that's supposed to serve as a solid foundation for them, fails them.

05:45:38.965 --> 05:45:49.240
So for the opportunity to create a perfect, or to give these children the opportunity to create, to have, I'm sorry.

05:45:51.738 --> 05:45:56.842
But how could you choose your own destiny when the education that's meant to be their solid foundation fills them?

05:45:57.002 --> 05:46:10.473
For the sake of the younger generation, we need you to present a solid plan for the ESSA that will directly address the shortfalls of the bottom 5% of our schools and a plan that will provide the children that we love with the support that they need.

05:46:11.935 --> 05:46:12.175
Thank you.

05:46:21.338 --> 05:46:23.078
Good afternoon, my name is Anthony Gatto.

05:46:23.199 --> 05:46:25.999
I'm a member of the Richmond community and a student at UC Berkeley.

05:46:26.699 --> 05:46:33.100
West Contra Costa Unified Students for Education Reform and I have been working really hard to provide a quality education for our students.

05:46:33.681 --> 05:46:34.481
But we can't do it alone.

05:46:34.921 --> 05:46:36.821
We need you, the State Board of Education.

05:46:37.461 --> 05:46:40.702
We want to have high expectations and high supports for our students and teachers.

05:46:41.442 --> 05:46:45.683
But how can we do that when our low income schools are not receiving the necessary resources?

05:46:46.598 --> 05:46:52.941
We want to have excellent teachers, more excellent teachers, but how can we do that when we aren't giving them a living wage or the proper training?

05:46:53.741 --> 05:47:01.305
We want to serve every child, but how can we do that when our undocumented, minority, low-income, at-risk youth are being left behind?

05:47:02.205 --> 05:47:09.489
We want justice in our schools, but how can we do that when instead of hiring a guidance counselor, we're now hiring school police?

05:47:10.592 --> 05:47:16.314
We want more quality choices for our parents, but we can't do that without your help on improving our schools.

05:47:17.595 --> 05:47:24.097
So I ask, do not settle for a satisfactory but an exemplary plan on how to improve our schools.

05:47:24.318 --> 05:47:24.598
Time.

05:47:25.118 --> 05:47:25.398
Thank you.

05:47:31.018 --> 05:47:31.619
Good afternoon.

05:47:31.679 --> 05:47:36.627
I'm standing in for Martha Zaragoza-Diaz, who had to be across the street at the Assembly Education Committee meeting.

05:47:37.247 --> 05:47:40.733
My name is Xiloni Cruz-Gonzalez, and I'm representing CABE and Californians Together.

05:47:41.360 --> 05:47:49.624
We would like to thank the board, CDE, and staff for agreeing to meet with us on the issue of the California Spanish assessment and its inclusion in the California accountability system.

05:47:50.425 --> 05:47:56.888
The meetings that were held were productive and the pros and cons and practicalities regarding this issue were clearly defined.

05:47:57.488 --> 05:48:02.511
Additionally, we were given an opportunity to provide a perspective and discuss how we can make this happen.

05:48:03.371 --> 05:48:11.718
We appreciate the agreement to meet with CDE to continue talking about the design and components of the CSA necessary for its inclusion in the state's accountability system.

05:48:12.118 --> 05:48:25.388
We support the proposed CSA language found on page 14 of attachment 1 memo and in its inclusion in the ESSA state plan and as well we respectfully request your support of this proposed revision to the ESSA state plan.

05:48:25.768 --> 05:48:26.429
Thank you very much.

05:48:32.608 --> 05:48:34.148
Hello, my name is Anya Hurwitz.

05:48:34.208 --> 05:48:36.369
I'm with the Sobrato Early Academic Language Model.

05:48:37.029 --> 05:48:41.870
I urge you to support the inclusion of the California Spanish assessment in the state accountability system.

05:48:42.450 --> 05:48:45.651
This is an essential element to a system committed to biliteracy.

05:48:46.631 --> 05:48:51.752
I would also like to underscore the comments of member Ortiz-Lacon.

05:48:52.592 --> 05:49:00.414
In addition, as we define interim progress and growth goals for each student indicator, it is essential that there be a differentiated

05:49:02.105 --> 05:49:04.967
growth target for subgroups historically underperforming.

05:49:05.448 --> 05:49:07.829
So we focus on closing the achievement gap.

05:49:08.270 --> 05:49:15.195
The language of ESSA plan should mirror and be comparable to the language related to closing gaps in the current LCAP directions.

05:49:15.635 --> 05:49:17.456
Let's be sure this is a plan for equity.

05:49:18.417 --> 05:49:29.051
And finally, this plan should focus on P-12 notions and systems of professional development that align and invest in early childhood education along with the K-12 system.

05:49:29.471 --> 05:49:35.258
And given our demographics and our track record, we need a strong focus on dual language learners.

05:49:35.338 --> 05:49:35.639
Thank you.

05:49:42.699 --> 05:49:45.201
Lynn Aoki, representing Californians Together.

05:49:45.942 --> 05:49:52.669
We argue that the progress of long-term English learners should be reported separately in the English Language Proficiency Test results.

05:49:53.329 --> 05:50:00.696
LTELs are an important and distinct subgroup with 59% of all secondary California English learners so designated.

05:50:01.417 --> 05:50:10.581
Currently, no LTEL subgroups are available, subgroup results are available, which both skews overall EL results and mutes LTEL needs.

05:50:11.121 --> 05:50:15.603
For more than a decade, we've reviewed achievement data as a whole and by significant subgroups.

05:50:16.123 --> 05:50:21.665
The reports help us to focus on and better meet the needs of specific subgroups that might require more assistance.

05:50:22.225 --> 05:50:28.868
A similar outcome could be achieved for LTELs with the disaggregation of an LTEL subgroup in English language proficiency results.

05:50:29.688 --> 05:50:45.191
With a state accountability system that provides specific reporting for LTELs, districts would find accessible focused data on that group that would encourage them to make informed instructional and programmatic improvements centered on the unique and specific needs of LTELs.

05:50:45.611 --> 05:50:45.872
Thank you.

05:50:51.670 --> 05:50:54.291
Hello, I'm Judy O'Loughlin from CATISO.

05:50:55.111 --> 05:51:04.834
I'd like to encourage you to support the inclusion of language proposed in this item to continue working to consider the inclusion of the CSA in the state accountability system.

05:51:05.454 --> 05:51:09.716
What I would like to address right now is Title II, supporting effective instruction.

05:51:10.476 --> 05:51:17.302
Every teacher in our California public schools is more than a teacher of math, science, social studies, or special education.

05:51:17.442 --> 05:51:19.303
Every teacher is a language teacher.

05:51:20.004 --> 05:51:28.610
And to have all these teachers trained to teach not only their content, but also the language of their content, this doesn't simply mean teaching vocabulary.

05:51:29.151 --> 05:51:32.253
That's almost really the easiest part of teaching language.

05:51:32.754 --> 05:51:36.697
It means teaching the language of content in terms of speaking,

05:51:37.277 --> 05:51:40.819
reading and writing about the content beyond just the vocabulary.

05:51:41.340 --> 05:51:52.806
Specialized professional development through Title II funds can help all the teachers in a school learn how to help English language write about, speak about, and read about the content.

05:51:53.246 --> 05:51:58.670
English language learners spend a lot of their time outside of bilingual or ESL classrooms.

05:51:59.450 --> 05:52:02.732
The remainder of their school day is spent with content specialists.

05:52:03.792 --> 05:52:04.633
Okay, thank you.

05:52:07.884 --> 05:52:11.408
Hi, Marsha Turner, Assistant Superintendent, retired 12 days today.

05:52:15.393 --> 05:52:24.103
And please support the including the language regarding the Spanish, California Spanish assessment in the accountability system.

05:52:25.064 --> 05:52:41.193
And also regarding the state ESSA plan, it would be helpful for districts, for CDE to include in that plan a description of the process and tools districts should follow for monitoring interim language proficiency growth during the school year in addition to monitoring growth in the LPAC.

05:52:41.853 --> 05:52:50.318
This will greatly enhance our ability to make sure English learners are making the desired growth throughout the year without waiting until the end of the year for the LPAC results.

05:52:50.578 --> 05:52:50.878
Thank you.

05:52:55.359 --> 05:52:56.139
Good afternoon.

05:52:56.159 --> 05:53:01.703
I'm Marta Hernandez, Assistant Superintendent for the Fillmore Unified School District in Ventura County.

05:53:02.143 --> 05:53:06.806
I was also a member of the EL Progress Indicator Workgroup.

05:53:07.666 --> 05:53:14.290
And again, I want to echo the words of appreciation regarding the new language regarding the California Spanish assessment.

05:53:14.750 --> 05:53:22.375
But my remarks are focused on Title III support for English learner students regarding the English learner exit criteria.

05:53:23.135 --> 05:53:28.460
I urge the state to continue its multiple measures approach.

05:53:29.061 --> 05:53:40.591
An annual ELP, English Language Proficiency Assessment, which of course is the ELPAC, which is designed specifically to measure English learners' proficiency in the English language

05:53:41.031 --> 05:53:56.363
and aligned to the ELD standards, as well as a reading language arts assessment that measures students' knowledge and skills in the specific academic content area of reading language arts, as well as teacher and parental input.

05:53:57.283 --> 05:54:07.667
We know that this is an era of rigorous and challenging standards, curriculum, and instruction, and it is not a time to water down the EL exit criteria.

05:54:08.187 --> 05:54:18.170
It is not yet certain that the LPAC can carry the heavy load of serving as both the language proficiency and academic assessment measures.

05:54:19.471 --> 05:54:19.751
Time.

05:54:20.331 --> 05:54:20.691
Thank you.

05:54:25.646 --> 05:54:38.610
Hello, my name is Michelle Soto-Pena, and I'm a fellow for the English Language Learner Leadership Initiative where I work alongside educational practitioners as an educational researcher in the field, and I'm also a graduate student at Claremont Graduate University.

05:54:39.290 --> 05:54:48.033
I would also like to thank for the inclusion of language to consider for the California Spanish Assessment Language as a qualifier for statewide academic accountability.

05:54:48.653 --> 05:55:02.961
And I would also like to add to my colleague, Martha, to please consider including into the ESSA state plan a validity and reliability study after two years of data to measure if there's a correlation between the LPAC and the SBAC.

05:55:03.362 --> 05:55:11.426
This will provide enough data to measure any patterns to verify if the LPAC is sufficiently aligned as an academic measure for English language learners.

05:55:12.107 --> 05:55:12.427
Thank you.

05:55:16.872 --> 05:55:20.854
Good afternoon, Honorable Superintendent Torlakson and members of the board.

05:55:21.395 --> 05:55:27.578
My name is Maria Villa, Director of Family Engagement for CABE Project to Inspire Parent Leadership Development Program.

05:55:28.259 --> 05:55:36.884
We know through our work in building leadership capacity with our families that the more informed our parents are on policies and understanding of the U.S.

05:55:36.904 --> 05:55:44.348
system of education, they have a better role in taking, having a voice for their children.

05:55:47.136 --> 05:55:50.761
which meant which for their children and English learners.

05:55:51.322 --> 05:56:00.514
This then leads to helping close our current achievement gap as well as supporting their education in their schools.

05:56:02.885 --> 05:56:12.273
Next, my colleagues Antoine Hernandez and Laura Diaz will share lived experiences shared by our parents going through our program.

05:56:13.254 --> 05:56:25.564
And we ask you to please consider that the development of templates and tools are thought with parent voice and teacher input.

05:56:25.825 --> 05:56:26.145
Thank you.

05:56:30.100 --> 05:56:33.303
Good afternoon, members of the board and superintendent.

05:56:33.343 --> 05:56:34.764
My name is Antoinette Hernandez.

05:56:34.824 --> 05:56:39.107
I'm a parent program specialist throughout the state of California for CABE.

05:56:39.788 --> 05:56:45.793
And as we know, there is a positive correlation between parent involvement and a child's success.

05:56:46.293 --> 05:56:50.057
Parents want to be informed about how they can support their child's learning.

05:56:50.757 --> 05:57:00.400
Providing access to more resources and providing more ways that parents can help to support their children at home will help us reach the heights that we seek.

05:57:01.200 --> 05:57:19.626
As a parent program specialist, one of my many repeated experience throughout the state that I can share is when one of my participants was able to help her child reclassify from EL to FEP once she became more informed about the language reclassification requirements through attending the workshops.

05:57:20.527 --> 05:57:31.418
As a result, she took it upon herself to make an appointment with her child's teacher and ask questions on how she could better support her child at home to obtain this reclassification.

05:57:31.758 --> 05:57:35.842
The parent read with her child every night she was able to achieve this.

05:57:36.163 --> 05:57:39.186
We urge the support to increase resources for ELs.

05:57:43.243 --> 05:57:45.204
Good evening, board members.

05:57:45.664 --> 05:58:02.312
My name is Laura Diaz, and as a current parent specialist for CABE, but more important, I am a parent who immigrated to this country, so I share the frustration that I encountered when I had no understanding about the system of education for the U.S.

05:58:03.032 --> 05:58:16.221
But also, I didn't know the policies or even though more extreme, I didn't know the programs that I can get for my child to learn English so he can be doing better performance in school.

05:58:16.701 --> 05:58:21.424
So I have to dive in the school system in order to know about programs that will support me.

05:58:22.624 --> 05:58:31.988
It was until I was part of the DILAC as a president that I had the knowledge and requirements of the different programs for the reclassification process.

05:58:32.588 --> 05:58:35.489
That allowed me, in collaboration with the Department of EL,

05:58:36.539 --> 05:58:47.042
at my district that we empower the parents to, they will have a better understanding of these programs, their role, their responsibilities, so they can achieve diversification in the children.

05:58:47.682 --> 05:58:49.003
So, just let me close with this.

05:58:49.483 --> 05:58:59.846
On this, we include the voices of the families and decision-making in the process of providing necessary toolkits or resources to help them to have a clear understanding of their role

05:59:00.246 --> 05:59:06.192
in supporting EL students, we will not be able to reach the high expectation that we have for reclassification.

05:59:06.392 --> 05:59:06.913
Thank you so much.

05:59:07.954 --> 05:59:10.356
With the following people, please join the line.

05:59:10.977 --> 05:59:20.426
Mabel Dagbarti, Jordan Ward, Mahogany Allen, Keisha McGee, Edward Brantley, Brandon Watts, Aaron Walker, Patty Herrera,

05:59:21.502 --> 05:59:30.770
Liz Guillen, Colleen Pachter, Mary Lee, Colin Miller, Marth Alvarez, Ralph Porras, Liza Malms, and Christy Sinclair.

05:59:32.652 --> 05:59:35.574
Good afternoon, Shelley, Spiegel, Coleman, Californians Together.

05:59:36.075 --> 05:59:45.543
We're encouraging you to adopt the language that the department has submitted in terms of the California Spanish assessment, but I'm here to talk to you about the identification of the 5% lowest schools.

05:59:47.865 --> 05:59:52.209
This is one of the areas that we believe needs serious revisiting in the ESSA plan.

05:59:52.649 --> 06:00:10.706
In a state with significant academic achievement gaps for many student subgroups and an LCFF law that calls for three subgroups as unduplicated students, it is very disconcerting that very few school districts are designated as the lowest performing inclusive of these subgroups.

06:00:11.186 --> 06:00:17.195
We understand that students with disabilities are a diverse group, that they represent the whole spectrum of students.

06:00:17.676 --> 06:00:26.269
But addressing students with disabilities who are African-Americans does not compute as addressing all the needs of a whole African-American subgroup.

06:00:26.850 --> 06:00:44.620
And so for us, we believe that the proposal that board member Lincoln Ortiz presented about having an additional filter for the 206 additional schools really needs to be through the lens of these student subgroups to make sure that all of our subgroups are being addressed who have needs.

06:00:45.120 --> 06:00:54.987
And I think what's really important is if you look at table five on page eight of your June agenda, you'll see that 139 schools are identified for solely one subgroup.

06:00:55.027 --> 06:00:57.169
So it's not multiple identifications.

06:00:57.469 --> 06:00:58.290
Thank you very much.

06:01:00.612 --> 06:01:01.793
Hi, I'm Lori Olson.

06:01:01.833 --> 06:01:03.574
I'm on the board of Californians Together.

06:01:03.975 --> 06:01:11.901
And again, we strongly support the language on this item about including the California Spanish assessment in the state accountability system.

06:01:12.361 --> 06:01:20.548
But I'm here to talk about the recommended revision to Title II in reference to the bilingual teacher shortage among other critical shortages.

06:01:20.988 --> 06:01:34.578
We want to share with you this new report released just yesterday based on surveys we conducted with ACSA from 111 school districts in the state that together educate 39% of California's English learners.

06:01:34.958 --> 06:01:40.482
And that data indicates that half of those districts currently are experiencing a shortage of bilingual teachers.

06:01:40.962 --> 06:01:51.450
And with plans to expand and initiate new bilingual programs under Prop 58, it's expected to grow to 86% of those districts facing a real shortage of bilingual teachers.

06:01:51.990 --> 06:02:00.457
We also did a survey, a teacher survey with CTA and CFT, where we identified as kind of the low-hanging fruit in response to this problem,

06:02:00.897 --> 06:02:11.047
about 6,000 bilingual teachers who are teaching in English-only settings right now, but with support of professional development, would be willing to and able to fill our bilingual classrooms.

06:02:11.328 --> 06:02:16.053
We have specific recommendations in this report we would like to see included in the ESSA plan.

06:02:16.093 --> 06:02:16.393
Thank you.

06:02:20.714 --> 06:02:21.355
Good afternoon.

06:02:21.775 --> 06:02:33.008
I'm Vicky Ramos-Harris with Advancement Project California, representing Early Childhood Voices, who signed on to this letter, as well as who informed this policy brief that you're getting handout right now.

06:02:34.318 --> 06:02:50.957
We appreciate that the plan calls for integration of early learning into an articulated preschool through 12th grade system and support CDE's recommendation to change the language of the plan to a P-12 plan, as well as other recommendations CDE has for including early learning in the plan.

06:02:52.057 --> 06:02:57.919
This will build on the child development principles to strengthen instructional practices for students beyond preschool.

06:02:58.299 --> 06:03:09.483
We urge the board to include additional P-12 language including use of Title II funds and offering state guidance for including early childhood educators in professional development,

06:03:09.943 --> 06:03:27.773
providing professional development on supporting dual language learners, offering state guidance for coordination and alignment between preschools, Head Start programs, and LEAs, and we request your support for the proposed language to include the California Spanish Assessment in the State Accountability Plan.

06:03:27.853 --> 06:03:28.153
Thank you.

06:03:32.762 --> 06:03:33.483
Good afternoon.

06:03:33.503 --> 06:03:39.127
I'm Carta Herrera, retired bilingual educator from preschool to IHE levels.

06:03:39.848 --> 06:03:43.431
I'm here, I'm a former IQC member, thank you.

06:03:43.971 --> 06:03:51.578
I'm here to request your support for item three, the ESSA state plan to include the California Spanish assessment in the state accountability system.

06:03:52.078 --> 06:03:56.162
Additionally, please include the following language in the ESSA state plan regarding

06:03:56.562 --> 06:03:57.843
school support and improvement.

06:03:58.483 --> 06:04:10.849
Under targeted and comprehensive support include the offering of preschool for underserved underachieving subgroups at the identified schools and districts to prepare for and accelerate learning for our youngest dual language learners.

06:04:11.289 --> 06:04:23.015
These early learning opportunities need to align the program services and professional development between preschool and TK3 and offer state guidance for coordination with state preschools and Head Start.

06:04:23.615 --> 06:04:30.214
Further, I appreciate that the plan calls for the integration of early learning into an articulated P-12 system.

06:04:30.515 --> 06:04:31.658
Thank you for this opportunity.

06:04:36.202 --> 06:04:36.803
Good afternoon.

06:04:36.843 --> 06:04:39.344
I'm Doug McRae, retired psychometrician from Monterey.

06:04:40.205 --> 06:04:47.610
On the lowest 5% of schools topic, there's a one-page handout on green with five points on it that's come around.

06:04:48.471 --> 06:05:01.600
Your discussion earlier indicated that parts 2, 3, 4, and 5 of my memo are no longer good for today, likely to be delayed until January.

06:05:02.460 --> 06:05:07.904
But I would like to say a word or two on point number one on the quality of the different indicators.

06:05:08.604 --> 06:05:13.507
Some of the indicators, the seven indicators on the table, are very robust.

06:05:13.707 --> 06:05:17.109
Some are very shaky and untested as accountability indicators.

06:05:18.630 --> 06:05:22.773
This begs for weights for the higher quality data.

06:05:24.283 --> 06:05:34.110
For equal weights for all seven indicators, it risks havoc when untested indicators take over any kind of an identification process.

06:05:34.990 --> 06:05:42.695
Finally, a different note, I recently learned in Arizona, ESSA permits a menu approach for high school state assessments.

06:05:43.476 --> 06:05:46.698
Has California considered this at all?

06:05:47.278 --> 06:05:47.559
Thank you.

06:05:53.365 --> 06:05:56.167
Good afternoon, Roberto Vida-Montes with the Learning Policy Institute.

06:05:56.587 --> 06:06:01.930
We'd like to thank CDE staff for engaging stakeholders on equitable access to excellent educators.

06:06:02.430 --> 06:06:09.694
With reporting data on teacher credentialing, LPI supports the proposed direction laid out in item three on reporting data on teacher credentialing status.

06:06:10.194 --> 06:06:19.299
Research shows that the share of teachers who have not met subject matter and teaching qualifications is strongly associated with teaching ineffectiveness as measured by student achievement gains.

06:06:19.779 --> 06:06:29.164
In addition, research on the teacher performance assessment shows that teacher candidate scores on the assessments predict student gains on state standardized tests for this reason as well.

06:06:29.604 --> 06:06:34.667
The percentage of fully credentialed teachers is an appropriate data point to help measure access to effective teaching.

06:06:35.327 --> 06:06:41.010
Also, we also strongly support the plan laid out in item three to report these data at the school level as well as the district level.

06:06:41.550 --> 06:06:44.852
And we think the best place to do this would be under priority one on the dashboard.

06:06:45.672 --> 06:06:58.522
Lastly, on credentialing, we recommend that over time, California collect and report additional data, including teacher survey data, which can assess school leadership, teacher collaboration and professional learning, teacher turnover and teacher absences.

06:06:58.683 --> 06:07:05.708
One last comment on early learning settings and teachers that work in those settings, because early learning educators often left out of PD opportunities.

06:07:06.048 --> 06:07:12.413
We strongly encourage the state plan to include a vision for supporting the EC workforce by encouraging both specialized and joint professional development.

06:07:12.654 --> 06:07:12.954
Thank you.

06:07:18.257 --> 06:07:18.957
Hello, good afternoon.

06:07:19.117 --> 06:07:20.158
My name is Jordan Ward.

06:07:20.198 --> 06:07:30.743
I'm an academic advisor with the Blue Educational Foundation, and today I'm here with COPE advocating for redefining and articulating teacher effectiveness in the ESSA plan.

06:07:31.324 --> 06:07:42.369
According to the ESSA, the state is to ensure that students will not be disproportionately served by ineffective teachers.

06:07:42.769 --> 06:07:47.172
We're just wanting a methodology and a criteria in which to determine the effectiveness of teachers in this regard.

06:07:47.532 --> 06:07:47.772
Thank you.

06:07:52.799 --> 06:07:56.342
My name is Erin Walker, and I'm with Blue Educational Foundation and COPE.

06:07:57.042 --> 06:08:05.669
For ESSA to work, for students to truly succeed on all accounts, A through G courses need to be a requirement for high school students to graduate.

06:08:06.470 --> 06:08:15.578
High school is supposed to prepare you for college, yet the Public Policy Institute says that over 50% of students graduate without having A through G courses completed.

06:08:16.078 --> 06:08:21.783
Now, this is a problem because A through G courses are the minimum requirement for Cal State and UCs.

06:08:22.463 --> 06:08:29.007
So I ask you, what kind of education system do we have if our own students can't attend our universities?

06:08:34.171 --> 06:08:34.511
Hello.

06:08:34.571 --> 06:08:35.652
Hi, I'm Mahogany Allen.

06:08:35.692 --> 06:08:38.134
I'm here with Blue Educational Foundation and COPE.

06:08:38.894 --> 06:08:41.116
I currently attend Cal State University East Bay.

06:08:41.556 --> 06:08:45.158
And ESSA states that we want to have effective teachers, as they had just said.

06:08:45.439 --> 06:08:47.500
But it's really hard for me as a student.

06:08:47.560 --> 06:08:49.261
This law is affecting me directly.

06:08:49.281 --> 06:08:51.603
It's really hard for me as a student when you have teachers who

06:08:52.063 --> 06:08:55.845
come in and they don't seem like they want to do their job or who aren't positive.

06:08:55.885 --> 06:08:58.426
It's hard for me as a student to want to even learn.

06:08:58.486 --> 06:09:12.534
So I know we all have things that we are going through, students and teachers, but I think in order to have effective teachers, we need to have teachers who want to be there and who are loving their job and who want to inspire students to do better.

06:09:12.814 --> 06:09:13.074
Thank you.

06:09:21.664 --> 06:09:22.364
Good afternoon.

06:09:22.404 --> 06:09:30.587
My name is Keisha McGee and I'm a parent and community member from Highland in the San Bernardino County.

06:09:30.827 --> 06:09:34.249
I am here with COBE and Inland Valley Advocate Group.

06:09:34.849 --> 06:09:45.193
We urge you to consider how the state plan should consult with a variety of stakeholders when developing the state plan.

06:09:45.711 --> 06:09:57.440
We appreciate the additional stakeholder input session offered by the CDE, which allowed for more stakeholders to engage in the development of the state accountability plan.

06:09:58.000 --> 06:10:12.350
While the dashboard is still in the pilot phase, we strongly urge the CDS to make additional enhancements to the dashboard so that it is more user friendly for parents and for the community.

06:10:12.771 --> 06:10:13.111
Thank you.

06:10:19.383 --> 06:10:20.444
Good afternoon, board members.

06:10:20.484 --> 06:10:21.605
My name is Brandon Watts.

06:10:21.725 --> 06:10:28.693
I am a junior at Howard University in Washington, D.C., and I was born and raised in the city of San Bernardino, California in San Bernardino County.

06:10:29.153 --> 06:10:32.717
Today, I'm here to talk to you about the purpose of an effective teacher.

06:10:32.737 --> 06:10:37.342
I grew up in a single parent household and having a teacher who having teachers

06:10:37.822 --> 06:10:45.128
that really cared about my education, having teachers who took that extra time to teach me problems after school when they didn't have to do that.

06:10:45.448 --> 06:10:46.870
That's what an effective teacher is.

06:10:47.230 --> 06:10:53.675
An ineffective teacher is a teacher who comes there, does their job, and if you have a problem, well, they pass you on to the next person in the next class.

06:10:54.076 --> 06:10:57.198
So there's a big difference between an ineffective teacher and an effective teacher.

06:10:57.558 --> 06:10:59.120
An effective teacher can save your life.

06:10:59.480 --> 06:11:01.662
An effective teacher can send you to Howard University.

06:11:02.062 --> 06:11:02.763
Thank you so much.

06:11:07.219 --> 06:11:08.080
Hello board members.

06:11:08.140 --> 06:11:12.825
My name is Mabel Morris-DiGuardi and I am a senior at Summit High School in the city of Fontana.

06:11:13.185 --> 06:11:14.807
I'm here with the Blue Foundation and COPE.

06:11:15.628 --> 06:11:27.880
I just wanted to say that I hope that ESSA could really build could help to build an effective teachers because with effective teachers could result in better better test scores and it could result in better learning.

06:11:28.761 --> 06:11:33.484
I was a junior last year, and our AP scores just came out for our APUSH class.

06:11:33.825 --> 06:11:35.226
Our teacher was not very effective.

06:11:35.286 --> 06:11:37.808
Every day he would come in saying he wasn't really teaching.

06:11:37.868 --> 06:11:39.229
All the students would feel the same way.

06:11:39.709 --> 06:11:42.431
And the scores came out, and I'm telling you, they were not great at all.

06:11:42.812 --> 06:11:48.576
I'm not proud at all, but with ESSA's help, hopefully we could build effective teachers that would improve these test scores.

06:11:48.797 --> 06:11:49.097
Thank you.

06:11:54.295 --> 06:11:55.476
Good afternoon, everybody.

06:11:56.477 --> 06:11:57.578
It's a pleasure being here.

06:11:58.059 --> 06:12:00.181
We've come a long way for one minute.

06:12:01.102 --> 06:12:03.384
So, my name is Edward Brantley.

06:12:03.524 --> 06:12:08.549
I'm with Youth Action Project as well as COPE.

06:12:09.210 --> 06:12:13.153
I also serve as Juvenile Justice Commissioner for San Bernardino County.

06:12:15.055 --> 06:12:22.077
Our organization, yeah, we provide direct support to the local school district there in San Bernardino.

06:12:22.097 --> 06:12:23.118
We're in all the high schools.

06:12:23.158 --> 06:12:25.219
We employ over 50 college students.

06:12:27.379 --> 06:12:31.401
This talk about school climate and accountability plan is excellent.

06:12:31.421 --> 06:12:34.902
There are some suggestions that we have.

06:12:35.562 --> 06:12:37.483
Transparency, greater transparency.

06:12:38.783 --> 06:12:42.385
in relation to where those funds are going, the LCAP funds.

06:12:43.685 --> 06:12:51.649
Do more to address targeted underperforming subgroups, please, as well as restorative justice.

06:12:52.569 --> 06:13:06.615
And please provide, you know, agency or capacity building funding for those agencies that are providing support for our local school.

06:13:06.815 --> 06:13:07.115
Thank you.

06:13:08.772 --> 06:13:11.554
I'd like to call the next group of speakers to please line up.

06:13:12.334 --> 06:13:36.171
Jason Henderson, Giselle Viveros, Catherina Gregana, Richard Jaffe-Cohen, Julie White, Angela Deramos, Eric Premack, Allison Osono, Leila Fahimuddin, Carrie Hanel, Brian Rivas, Brian Lee, Jordan Thiry, Sarah Lillis, Samantha Tran,

06:13:36.747 --> 06:13:44.911
Brian Gabrud, Rodney Van, Art Cruz, Mari Sol, Ray Rucha, and Leangela Reed.

06:13:49.696 --> 06:13:53.397
Good afternoon, Mr. President, Superintendent Torlakson, members of the board.

06:13:53.717 --> 06:13:58.238
LeAngela Reed on behalf of the Small School Districts Association, SDA.

06:13:58.718 --> 06:14:09.960
I just want to, one, thank you for how frequent I heard the recognition and acknowledgement of the situation relative to smalls mentioned in the conversation.

06:14:11.901 --> 06:14:15.622
It's really important and I so appreciate that the board recognizes that.

06:14:16.182 --> 06:14:16.922
And to that point,

06:14:17.182 --> 06:14:25.346
I want to echo the comments relative to waiting for another year of data and also to looking at the volatility of information for the smalls.

06:14:25.587 --> 06:14:28.608
One student can send a small into REDD.

06:14:29.108 --> 06:14:30.749
And I think it's important to recognize that.

06:14:31.130 --> 06:14:38.974
Also relative to the competitive grants, although I really appreciate the geographically diverse language that was offered in the recommendation by CDE,

06:14:39.934 --> 06:14:43.118
It grants are notoriously very difficult for smalls.

06:14:43.158 --> 06:14:47.422
We don't have grant writers because they're driving the bus and serving a superintendent.

06:14:48.183 --> 06:14:51.387
And so it's important that to recognize that capacity issue.

06:14:51.427 --> 06:14:58.634
And I think the recommendation by member Rucker is something that would be more effective for smalls.

06:14:58.775 --> 06:14:59.035
Thank you.

06:15:04.099 --> 06:15:07.021
Hi, Colleen Pachter on behalf of Los Angeles Unified School District.

06:15:07.522 --> 06:15:25.876
In response to the proposed approaches for aligning the identification of the lowest performing schools with LCFF, LAUSD recommends identifying schools regardless of their LEA affiliation and ensuring that LEAs with a concentration of identified schools are eligible for state support in addition to those that currently qualify under the adopted LCFF criteria.

06:15:26.896 --> 06:15:36.280
LASD believes that the state's lowest performing schools need supplemental supports and any approach whereby schools are not eligible for such support simply because of LEA affiliation would be inequitable.

06:15:37.160 --> 06:15:44.502
LASD believes that it is more important for the appropriate schools to be identified first and then align the supports for those schools with LCFF and their related priorities.

06:15:45.283 --> 06:15:53.966
In addition, the intern credential teacher pipeline encourages the hiring of highly capable and diverse teachers at a time when attracting and retaining new teachers into the profession is of

06:15:54.967 --> 06:15:55.829
critical importance.

06:15:56.591 --> 06:16:02.823
Because of this LAUSD asked that the reference to intern credential teachers be removed from the proposed definition of ineffective teachers.

06:16:03.344 --> 06:16:03.665
Thank you.

06:16:08.035 --> 06:16:08.555
Good afternoon.

06:16:08.615 --> 06:16:12.218
Martha Albers on behalf of AXA, the Association of California School Administrators.

06:16:12.799 --> 06:16:15.181
I'll just start off with the last comment by LAUSD.

06:16:15.761 --> 06:16:19.784
We had expressed concerns in our letter regarding the ineffective teacher definition.

06:16:20.385 --> 06:16:23.527
We would point you to those comments so you can have them in more detail.

06:16:23.868 --> 06:16:31.914
But we have concerns about using the definition as any interim credential teacher because that does not mean that the quality of the instruction is there.

06:16:32.695 --> 06:16:36.298
Regarding the 5% of schools that have to be identified for ESSA purposes,

06:16:36.978 --> 06:16:39.199
We have a lot of questions about the data simulations.

06:16:39.539 --> 06:16:40.699
Good questions, if anything.

06:16:41.060 --> 06:16:42.760
It's triggering conversation within AXA.

06:16:43.320 --> 06:16:54.424
We would like to encourage CDE for the August memo that will be coming out to provide greater clarity about where those 298 schools fall within the 181 LEAs.

06:16:54.785 --> 06:17:04.148
We want to see that concentration or the distribution of those schools just because we want to ensure that it's aligned to the regional support structure that was discussed in item number two.

06:17:04.648 --> 06:17:16.774
So we want to see this alignment of these conversations, not in isolation, because our concern would be that we're concentrating the support in only 20 LEAs or 181 LEAs when schools may be all over the state.

06:17:17.074 --> 06:17:17.394
Thank you.

06:17:22.398 --> 06:17:24.740
Hello, Liz Guillen with Public Advocates.

06:17:25.881 --> 06:17:36.408
We also support the comments around delaying the identification of the methodology for identifying the second set of the lowest 5% of Title I schools.

06:17:40.031 --> 06:17:56.740
In terms of the ineffective teacher definition, we support and recommend that you begin developing a plan so that we have additional data, additional measures like teacher turnover,

06:17:57.626 --> 06:18:10.192
teacher attendance and teacher survey data that measures teachers opportunities to collaborate and engage in learning and also the level of support that principals provide.

06:18:11.553 --> 06:18:11.993
Thank you.

06:18:16.072 --> 06:18:18.993
Good afternoon, Colin Miller with the California Charter Schools Association.

06:18:19.833 --> 06:18:27.876
I do want to join a small minority, including Mr. McRae, on concerns about using the all-ethical indicators methodology.

06:18:27.976 --> 06:18:31.077
We do think that academics need to have a higher weight.

06:18:31.777 --> 06:18:39.700
Some of these other metrics, while they're very important, also are very troubling for small admission-driven schools because they're so volatile.

06:18:40.280 --> 06:18:49.233
and could trip schools into intervention at the risk of over-identifying schools and not getting at the right schools that really truly need the intervention.

06:18:50.175 --> 06:18:56.324
Overall, we are concerned about the ESSA plan and the lack of any real acknowledgement about the specific

06:18:57.505 --> 06:19:06.011
the specific requirements of ESSA to include accountability for charter schools to be overseen in accordance with state charter school law.

06:19:07.252 --> 06:19:09.234
That seems to be completely absent from the plan.

06:19:09.274 --> 06:19:14.618
We've talked about the credentialing issue a little bit today and we have a letter that addresses some of that.

06:19:14.998 --> 06:19:18.680
but also in terms of the selection of the 5% and how charter schools are included in that.

06:19:19.001 --> 06:19:20.641
We think that's very important to address that.

06:19:21.382 --> 06:19:27.426
We would encourage you to use your ACCS, your Charter School Advisory Commission, to vet some of these charter-specific issues.

06:19:28.126 --> 06:19:39.293
In your attachment 3, there's no recognition of any charter school organizations that have participated specifically in that input, and your ACCS is at your disposal for that.

06:19:39.393 --> 06:19:39.633
Thank you.

06:19:42.793 --> 06:19:43.394
Good afternoon.

06:19:43.715 --> 06:19:47.002
My name is Julie White and I am here on behalf of the core districts.

06:19:48.100 --> 06:20:00.406
The core districts are urging you to create an innovation zone as part of the ESSA state plan so that interested districts can work with the state to explore indicators that are helping improve student outcomes.

06:20:00.927 --> 06:20:06.129
I brought language here today on the innovation zone so you can consider it as part of your discussion.

06:20:06.830 --> 06:20:12.873
Several board members have raised concerns about lacking data and research to make informed decisions.

06:20:13.613 --> 06:20:26.695
As you dive into the Innovation Zone language, you'll see that the Innovation Zone purposely creates space for innovative districts to share data and research with the state to improve the evolving accountability system.

06:20:27.516 --> 06:20:40.458
The Innovation Zone should be part of the ESSA plan because it sends a clear signal to the feds that California, and to the state, and to local districts, that California prioritizes local control, innovation, and continuous improvement.

06:20:44.844 --> 06:20:46.465
Hi, Angela de Ramos with CTA.

06:20:47.025 --> 06:20:51.886
We recognize and appreciate that federal requirements may prove irreconcilable with the California way.

06:20:52.466 --> 06:21:00.209
In this light, CTA wishes to express appreciation for the board and their adherence to guiding principles in creating a single coherent system.

06:21:01.009 --> 06:21:07.311
In our last state council, nearly 800 CTA educators poured over the draft ESSA plan.

06:21:07.611 --> 06:21:10.432
Our feedback and recommendations are detailed at length in our letter.

06:21:11.172 --> 06:21:13.674
I know you're excited to read this letter, but I'll give you some highlights.

06:21:14.435 --> 06:21:15.596
First of all, some kudos.

06:21:16.016 --> 06:21:22.661
Specifically, we commend staff on progress towards defining ineffective teacher for the limited purposes under ESSA.

06:21:23.141 --> 06:21:27.645
Furthermore, we appreciate new options for identifying the lowest 5% of Title I schools.

06:21:28.045 --> 06:21:33.570
CTA is studying these options carefully and looks forward to engaging with staff on these options in the next few weeks.

06:21:34.230 --> 06:21:40.914
In general, we support the direction of the board in adopting baseline methodologies, but do ask for clarification in what is being approved in Attachment 1.

06:21:41.755 --> 06:21:48.919
The proposal revisions are vague and we want to avoid a blanket approval for yet to be defined times driven by federal peer review criteria.

06:21:49.480 --> 06:21:55.324
In addition, we request further details on how staff will provide a transparent process in developing this plan from now until September.

06:21:55.584 --> 06:21:55.824
Thank you.

06:22:01.178 --> 06:22:08.660
Hello, my name is Allison Osorio and I am here representing UnidosUS, formerly known as National Council of La Raza and CLR.

06:22:09.401 --> 06:22:15.422
UnidosUS has been working to close opportunity and achievement gaps for Latino students and English learners.

06:22:16.063 --> 06:22:23.365
We believe California, which is home to more than a quarter of the nation's Latino student population, can and must be a leader in this effort.

06:22:24.165 --> 06:22:35.768
The plan must explicitly set goals and describe the state's long-term goals and measures of interim progress by considering the improvement necessary to make significant progress on closing achievement and graduation gaps.

06:22:36.688 --> 06:22:39.209
The goals should be clear, achievable, and ambitious.

06:22:39.909 --> 06:22:44.130
These goals should be clearly communicated to parents and the community.

06:22:44.750 --> 06:22:51.276
California needs to be clearer about the outcomes for which all schools and districts should aim and how the goals will matter.

06:22:51.637 --> 06:22:53.779
We truly believe that this is the next step.

06:22:54.279 --> 06:22:57.382
This is the step that needs to be taken to close the achievement gap in California.

06:22:57.563 --> 06:22:57.823
Thank you.

06:23:03.578 --> 06:23:08.144
Hello, Leila Fahimuddin with the National Center for Youth Law's Foster Ed California Initiative.

06:23:08.885 --> 06:23:21.140
As you work to finalize the ESSA state plan and ensure that it flows with our commitment to centering high-need student groups under LCFF, we urge the board and CDE to keep in mind the foster youth education stability provisions under ESSA.

06:23:21.941 --> 06:23:27.285
ESSA requires the state to ensure that foster youth are able to remain in their school of origin when in their best interest.

06:23:27.705 --> 06:23:37.733
And to make that a reality, LEAs receiving Title I funds together with county welfare agencies must establish how exactly they will get students transported to their school.

06:23:38.533 --> 06:23:43.855
To date, many LEAs have not yet established these procedures despite a December 2016 deadline.

06:23:44.495 --> 06:24:05.883
While we're in ongoing conversations with CDE staff, in keeping with the board and CDE's commitment to ensure that California implements ESSA with student equity front and center, we urge the board to support CDE in issuing state-level guidance in partnership with the state's Department of Social Services to LEAs in meeting these requirements under ESSA, including conducting

06:24:07.384 --> 06:24:12.053
a transportation procedures checklist for use when conducting Title I Part A monitoring.

06:24:12.474 --> 06:24:17.162
We have further recommendations in our letter to CDE and appreciate your attention to this matter.

06:24:22.793 --> 06:24:29.575
Good afternoon, Monique Ramos standing in for Katharina Gargana, representing First 5 LA, First 5 California, and the First 5 Association.

06:24:30.275 --> 06:24:37.657
First off, we'd like to appreciate the changes to the current version of the state plan with the integration of early learning into the plan.

06:24:38.177 --> 06:24:46.400
We request that you adopt the recommendations in the addendum to further integrate early learning and the P-12 concept throughout the plan.

06:24:47.495 --> 06:24:54.441
In addition, we request that you add early learning and a dual language learner representative on the California Practitioners Group.

06:24:55.202 --> 06:25:13.537
And finally, encourage that you encourage school districts to use Title II funds for professional development for elementary principals and preschool administrators so that they can have training on the effectiveness of teachers teaching our earliest learners.

06:25:13.738 --> 06:25:14.018
Thank you.

06:25:18.470 --> 06:25:18.851
Afternoon.

06:25:18.911 --> 06:25:21.114
Jordan Theory on behalf of the Alliance for Boys and Men of Color.

06:25:21.935 --> 06:25:35.534
We think that the draft ESSA state plan should include steps that the department will take to consider and include new data and indicators to look at school climate

06:25:37.035 --> 06:25:54.022
including teachers and staff that are trained on restorative and positive discipline practices, the percentage of those teachers that are, teacher and staff attendance, teacher and staff retention rates, as well as pupil arrests and referrals on school sites.

06:25:55.042 --> 06:26:15.088
Additionally, related to the assessment section, we recommend that to better support English language learners for the statewide exam, there are only 10 languages translated in the glossaries, while for the instructions on the exam, it's translated into 17 different languages.

06:26:15.388 --> 06:26:20.129
We recommend expanding the glossary translations to all 17 of those same languages.

06:26:21.991 --> 06:26:37.147
For accountability, we think the ESSA plan should be more clear in strengthening the reporting requirements on school site expenditures for each school in the state and have those expenditures disaggregated by funding source.

06:26:37.348 --> 06:26:37.588
Thank you.

06:26:41.377 --> 06:26:44.300
Hello, Brian Glossary with the Juvenile Court and Community Schools.

06:26:44.921 --> 06:27:02.980
To open, it is recommended that much of the language contained in Title I, Part A be considered for Title I, Part D. Additionally, Title I, Part A does not acknowledge the delicate topic of students transitioning from confinement to community, which includes the transition from alternative-based education and justice facilities to potentially the student's home districts.

06:27:03.681 --> 06:27:12.024
Assessments identifying familial needs for the students are necessary to address factors that typically lead to further delinquency, truancy, or re-engagement in the justice system.

06:27:12.444 --> 06:27:19.526
Current assessments tied to education-related needs and obstacles are inadequate as many familial-related issues can be overlooked.

06:27:19.886 --> 06:27:25.808
Proposition 47 was a strong step forward in mitigating the consequences stemming from the trauma experienced by formerly incarcerated youth.

06:27:26.248 --> 06:27:26.588
However,

06:27:27.168 --> 06:27:36.974
The necessary funds to both effectively assess youth exiting confinement and to provide them with opportunities to transition into circumstances that encourage self-sufficiency are severely lacking.

06:27:37.354 --> 06:27:47.261
In closing, the alternative accountability tool associated with Title I, Part D needs to acknowledge the unique variables experienced by families of at-risk youth transitioning from confinement to community schools.

06:27:47.581 --> 06:27:47.821
Thank you.

06:27:54.167 --> 06:27:57.348
Greetings, Superintendent Torlakson and board members.

06:27:58.068 --> 06:28:05.790
My name is Rodney Vann, former at-risk student, retired probation officer, and currently with the San Diego County Office of Education within the juvenile court and community schools.

06:28:06.350 --> 06:28:10.031
I'm also the parent of three children, two of which are graduates of UCLA.

06:28:11.192 --> 06:28:19.974
With respect to Title 1A within the ESSA state plan school support and improvements, I found that all students have gifts and a desire to learn.

06:28:20.774 --> 06:28:27.180
The key is assuring we present them with effective educators and leadership to bring them to their full potential.

06:28:27.820 --> 06:28:34.166
Additional funding should be allocated to teacher training and or retraining within the guidelines of Title II.

06:28:34.987 --> 06:28:41.372
We must have districts that are willing to be progressive in regards to culturally responsive curriculum.

06:28:42.273 --> 06:28:52.257
academic credential, excuse me, academic credit for all students for career technical education classes, as well as more opportunities for parental engagement.

06:28:52.797 --> 06:28:55.218
Let's meet the students where they are, not where we are.

06:28:55.498 --> 06:28:55.758
Thank you.

06:29:02.638 --> 06:29:05.779
Art Cruz with the Juvenile Court and Community Schools in San Diego.

06:29:07.059 --> 06:29:15.742
The continued recruitment and retention of teachers of color and professional development in the areas of socioeconomic differences for all teachers is of utmost importance.

06:29:16.442 --> 06:29:20.503
Our students are challenged to see their faces and hear their voices in the teachers and staffs around them.

06:29:21.323 --> 06:29:34.270
Many if not most of our students live in a very different economic and social situation from the staff they encounter in school, whether it's gang involvement, lack of housing, economic challenges, or simply not knowing where their next meal is coming from.

06:29:34.930 --> 06:29:42.394
The disconnect between socioeconomic pressures on our students and their families and the academic expectations, excuse me, is vast.

06:29:43.356 --> 06:29:56.437
Continued and consistent access to professional development, addressing cultural diversity and socioeconomic differences for teachers and administration would help to bridge the divide and help students feel safe to be heard and understood.

06:29:56.777 --> 06:29:57.058
Thank you.

06:30:02.603 --> 06:30:04.945
Superintendent Herlixson, hello, and board.

06:30:05.505 --> 06:30:09.508
I am Marisol Quevedo-Ruche, Parent Educator Advocate.

06:30:10.048 --> 06:30:16.252
I represent practitioners through the lens of teacher, traditional, charter, and now county office of education administrators.

06:30:16.813 --> 06:30:26.099
My passion is ensuring the best education for at-risk youth in our international border region of San Diego, and that includes those in the juvenile community school.

06:30:26.559 --> 06:30:30.022
It is time that we value the voice and language of our youth.

06:30:30.442 --> 06:30:37.227
We must have CSA included as a required option to SBAC in Title 1 Part A accountability.

06:30:37.768 --> 06:30:48.315
We must use the ESSA State Plan to provide truly comprehensive supports in the mainstream system to truly prevent our precious youth from entering this alternative at-risk status.

06:30:48.856 --> 06:30:57.062
You need to include common definitions and expectations of cultural responsiveness, trauma-informed care, and equity and diversity training.

06:30:58.400 --> 06:31:07.042
in all of the plans for school support and improvement, access to educators, school conditions, prevention and intervention for at-risk youth, and supporting effective instruction.

06:31:08.002 --> 06:31:10.443
It is time for us to save our youth.

06:31:10.483 --> 06:31:15.624
If you want to save lives and keep our kids out of prison, then we also need to start addressing the needs of their families.

06:31:15.664 --> 06:31:19.945
So when you're talking about mental health supports and training, you need to include families in that.

06:31:19.985 --> 06:31:20.665
Thank you very much.

06:31:27.613 --> 06:31:31.674
President Kirst, Brian Revis speaking on behalf of the Education Trust West.

06:31:32.855 --> 06:31:35.336
Two issues I want to share with or comment on.

06:31:35.616 --> 06:31:40.077
One regarding school identification and differentiation of schools.

06:31:40.657 --> 06:31:54.162
We would urge the board to avoid a methodology that does not identify schools as low performing if they're outside of a district that's identified as in need of assistance under the LCFF rules.

06:31:54.762 --> 06:31:56.744
We think that's very problematic.

06:31:56.905 --> 06:32:02.931
We need you to be honest with the community and parents when there's a low level of performance in a school.

06:32:03.792 --> 06:32:09.819
We would run the risk of treating students similarly situated differently if we did that.

06:32:10.840 --> 06:32:16.504
With regard to educator effectiveness, we agree with some of the sentiments expressed by member Holiday.

06:32:17.565 --> 06:32:24.911
Ultimately, we would like to see the plan address which teachers are likely to help students and who has access.

06:32:25.432 --> 06:32:35.460
But at this stage, we would like you to consider a multiple measures approach that is sort of like a dashboard showing the teacher workforce by school site.

06:32:46.089 --> 06:32:47.711
Good afternoon, Sarah Lillis with EdVoice.

06:32:48.411 --> 06:33:01.124
We just wanted to make sure first that you'd seen the letter from Senator Ben Hueso and Dr. Shirley Weber and several other legislators expressing their concern that the intent of LCFF was still not totally reflected in the SSA plan and the accountability system.

06:33:01.564 --> 06:33:07.810
And just returning back to what the legislators expressed and what we heard from Governor Brown when he talked about his

06:33:09.031 --> 06:33:25.832
Aristotelian justice is not just about getting resources to low-income school students, English learners, and foster youth, but actually increase and improve services to change the outcomes because we have a history, a shameful history, of achievement gaps that need to be addressed that we can't deny when we look at assessment data.

06:33:26.352 --> 06:33:42.302
And when we looked at the LCFF methodology for identifying LEAs, we were surprised not that students with disabilities were at districts serving students with disabilities were identified, but apparently we don't really have a problem with low-income students, English learners, and students of color and their subgroups.

06:33:42.822 --> 06:33:48.709
And that reflects either we misunderstood the assessment data or there's something with our LCFF methodology.

06:33:48.809 --> 06:33:57.779
And we would encourage you to look at that and we would find more coherence with the ESSA plan of identifying schools if we were to review that methodology in LCFF.

06:33:59.461 --> 06:33:59.721
Thank you.

06:34:03.595 --> 06:34:05.336
Good afternoon, Samantha Tran with Children Now.

06:34:05.777 --> 06:34:24.530
We submitted some background materials with the board item and analysis of the identification of the lowest performing schools and just wanted to raise that we have a concern as we're looking at the data that we're losing a lot of information when we move to the color coding system and in fact it's creating some

06:34:27.032 --> 06:34:29.574
outcomes that when you look at the data, you're like, how can this be?

06:34:29.634 --> 06:34:38.000
It's very counterintuitive and could lead to a dynamic where when the public starts looking at the identification of schools, that it could feel arbitrary.

06:34:38.080 --> 06:34:42.924
And so wanting to be very careful about how we determine this methodology.

06:34:42.964 --> 06:34:51.671
In our materials, we actually included a strategy that could bring back a lot of the data that's underneath the color coding system while still trying to stay within the framework.

06:34:52.071 --> 06:34:53.052
that the board has adopted.

06:34:53.072 --> 06:35:00.317
And we know that the time is short and that we're all trying to figure this out and want to be a resource as that happens.

06:35:00.837 --> 06:35:15.728
In addition, as you've heard from many of the testimony and our letter on this front, there's still a number of issues within the plan around teacher equity, transparency, interim goals and the like that we are hoping will be addressed in the near term.

06:35:15.908 --> 06:35:16.168
Thank you.

06:35:21.098 --> 06:35:22.459
Eric Premack, Charter School Center.

06:35:22.819 --> 06:35:26.340
Still have a number of questions or concerns with the ESSA plan.

06:35:26.880 --> 06:35:28.721
Conflicts with charter law in two areas.

06:35:28.781 --> 06:35:30.682
First, with respect to teacher credentialing.

06:35:31.182 --> 06:35:40.345
We need it to explicitly reflect both subject assignment flexibility and credentialing flexibility for non-core, non-college prep courses.

06:35:40.385 --> 06:35:42.226
That's not reflected in the current draft.

06:35:42.786 --> 06:35:50.830
It also doesn't reflect any of the flexibility accorded to charters under the eight state priorities and the selection criteria.

06:35:51.830 --> 06:36:00.574
Third point, we support the use of formula-driven distribution of all of the federal funds, not just the Title IV, but even getting down to the homeless money, you name it.

06:36:01.655 --> 06:36:07.579
We really find the nickel and diming of the way the federal funds are distributed to be problematic.

06:36:07.999 --> 06:36:16.586
And my last point is, and I may be crazy, but I still think we should just tell the feds we want the mother of all waivers and we want to use the dashboard to drive this process.

06:36:17.186 --> 06:36:19.309
believe me, this is not a unified system.

06:36:19.329 --> 06:36:26.399
I'm going to have a hell of a time explaining even what you think is a unified system to my members because it's still very different.

06:36:26.459 --> 06:36:30.284
It's just like the old system where we had A1P and API, really.

06:36:30.584 --> 06:36:34.109
So let's just give it a whirl, see what DeVos will give us.

06:36:34.349 --> 06:36:34.610
Thank you.

06:36:39.755 --> 06:36:42.556
Good afternoon, Superintendent Torlakson and board.

06:36:43.317 --> 06:36:44.277
I'm Richard Cohen.

06:36:44.377 --> 06:36:48.299
I'm one of the board of directors of Restore the Schools Vision Project.

06:36:48.799 --> 06:36:53.181
And also we are members as a group of the Fixed School Discipline Coalition.

06:36:54.242 --> 06:36:55.542
And you have letters from us.

06:36:55.582 --> 06:37:04.947
You have submissions that we made, which outline in great detail our concerns about how we're going to implement ESSA and on a state level.

06:37:05.287 --> 06:37:05.607
I take

06:37:07.848 --> 06:37:19.576
President Kirste comments from the very beginning at 8.30 this morning when he said that we didn't want to really get into the details here dealing with the federal government.

06:37:19.596 --> 06:37:25.680
We thought we'd just stay more general and not talk about programs or specifics.

06:37:27.621 --> 06:37:29.102
We have some trouble with that.

06:37:30.023 --> 06:37:36.487
And the reason we have trouble with it is to do with the students who came in here today and made wonderful performances.

06:37:37.127 --> 06:37:39.909
They were performances, but presentations and performances.

06:37:40.769 --> 06:37:43.871
One in particular, the group that came in from, I think, San Bernardino.

06:37:44.472 --> 06:37:45.292
Oh, already, huh?

06:37:45.432 --> 06:37:47.133
Well, we'll just say this.

06:37:49.975 --> 06:37:57.079
There is an urgency here, and I do not believe that we can afford to let this opportunity slip.

06:37:57.779 --> 06:37:58.860
We don't have the time.

06:37:59.300 --> 06:38:00.100
Now is the time.

06:38:00.280 --> 06:38:02.762
So I'd urge you to be more specific.

06:38:03.082 --> 06:38:04.543
It's laid out in our submissions.

06:38:04.643 --> 06:38:04.903
Thank you.

06:38:08.010 --> 06:38:11.773
Hi, Brian Lee on behalf of Fight Crime Invest in Kids, Mission Readiness and Ready Nation.

06:38:12.654 --> 06:38:22.882
As to the 5% of lowest performing schools, I'm really excited that you guys are going to wait and take a look at the data because I think you really need to and I think that you can move better than the recommendation that was before you.

06:38:23.302 --> 06:38:30.187
I just recommend that to pick the lowest 5% of performing schools, pick the lowest 5% of performing schools, not the lowest 6.5% and then take 5% of those.

06:38:33.409 --> 06:38:37.411
The department gave three arguments why not to do the option three, which just looked at all schools.

06:38:37.431 --> 06:38:39.971
They said it wasn't aligned very well.

06:38:40.011 --> 06:38:45.953
But as my remarks earlier in the day suggested, we have some gaps from the LCFF accountability system.

06:38:45.973 --> 06:38:47.894
We're missing a lot of subgroup problems.

06:38:48.274 --> 06:38:57.997
And I think that this may sound crazy, but maybe ESSA compliments LCFF because it allows us occasionally to look at schools where there might be concentrated subgroups and say, hey, those people need assistance.

06:38:58.017 --> 06:39:00.698
Because if we aggregate things at the district level, you sometimes miss that.

06:39:01.178 --> 06:39:04.983
Also, they said, oh, it's going to triple the number of districts.

06:39:05.363 --> 06:39:11.290
It's going to go 49 more districts, 80 more schools, on top of hundreds of districts and hundreds of schools.

06:39:11.350 --> 06:39:12.351
It's really not that much more.

06:39:12.472 --> 06:39:12.772
Thank you.

06:39:17.574 --> 06:39:23.516
Martha Zaragoza-Diaz representing California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

06:39:24.017 --> 06:39:39.803
The proposed revision regarding the definition of an ineffective teacher is tied to California's ongoing efforts to implement LCFF priority one, which recognizes that LEAs should be accountable for having teachers who are fully credentialed.

06:39:40.443 --> 06:39:52.172
In light of the passage of Proposition 58, it is recommended that this should also include teachers who are not only fully credentialed, but teachers who also hold a bilingual authorization.

06:39:52.793 --> 06:40:03.160
In addition to the data identified on page 7 of Attachment 1, it is recommended to include data on the percent of teachers with bilingual authorizations.

06:40:03.661 --> 06:40:03.961
Thank you.

06:40:08.683 --> 06:40:10.944
Terry Burns, California School Boards Association.

06:40:10.984 --> 06:40:16.768
We appreciate the dialogue about moving to a richer and more timely data set.

06:40:16.808 --> 06:40:30.696
We think that's really very important, particularly for the small school districts, those schools who will have a red indicator only on suspension that is tied to one event that happened after one crazy football game.

06:40:31.657 --> 06:40:41.546
I just don't think that it builds great credibility if that's otherwise a great school and their scores are strong and if you're going to put them on a list of the worst schools in the state.

06:40:41.726 --> 06:40:47.451
So to build, we think it'll be more helpful to have the richer data set as you build credibility for the system.

06:40:47.571 --> 06:40:47.931
Thank you.

06:40:49.573 --> 06:40:49.913
Okay.

06:40:49.973 --> 06:40:52.535
Well, I think the board needs another break.

06:40:52.555 --> 06:40:53.676
So we'll reconvene at 4.05.

06:41:06.678 --> 06:41:09.820
Okay, the State Board will reconvene.

06:41:11.220 --> 06:41:11.741
Thank you.

06:41:17.304 --> 06:41:28.149
So I'm going to turn to Board Member Sun to begin our discussion by framing, by presenting a motion.

06:41:29.570 --> 06:41:32.072
And her motion would include all of the

06:41:34.734 --> 06:41:50.631
elements of the presentations that we heard today, including the presentations by the Department of Ed, all three on, all three parts of the presentation made by three members of the CDE.

06:41:51.652 --> 06:41:52.453
Board Member Sun.

06:41:54.617 --> 06:41:55.317
Okay, great.

06:41:55.417 --> 06:42:09.484
So we're going to try to move through this as logically and clearly as we can, because we've been presented with a lot of information and there's so much in each of these sections that have been discussed.

06:42:10.044 --> 06:42:13.526
So I'm going to bring forward two separate motions.

06:42:14.306 --> 06:42:20.952
The first that addresses all proposed revisions except for the Title I, Part A accountability.

06:42:20.972 --> 06:42:23.835
We're going to put that aside.

06:42:24.395 --> 06:42:32.382
The second is going to be related to Title I, Part A accountability section, which was addressed separately in Attachment 2.

06:42:34.068 --> 06:42:43.317
So the first part, the first motion is related to the access to educators.

06:42:43.997 --> 06:42:50.584
So I, when I made my comments earlier, I felt like it didn't give enough of a little bit lead.

06:42:50.664 --> 06:42:50.884
So I,

06:42:52.345 --> 06:43:00.587
Just to go on record, the whole ineffective teacher definition gives me heartburn, and I've expressed that several, several times.

06:43:01.488 --> 06:43:09.970
And we certainly know that there is much more to that definition than simply by a credential.

06:43:11.111 --> 06:43:11.751
Nevertheless,

06:43:13.432 --> 06:43:22.671
We need to move forward and we're not going to be able to come to some consensus around what effective teacher is at this point in time and we need to move forward.

06:43:25.749 --> 06:43:51.008
with that and I do want to also say that as it is aligned to while my recommendation is that we align it to LCFF definition under priority one, I do feel that California, we need to do some work around this area and flesh out and some of the CDE PowerPoint

06:43:51.588 --> 06:43:55.791
did indicate about looking at additional information.

06:43:56.371 --> 06:44:15.884
So with that, I'm going to move the staff recommendation to approve the revisions to the State Plan proposed in Attachment 1 and Attachment 4 with the exception of the proposed changes to Title 1 Part A Accountability Section with the following two changes.

06:44:16.884 --> 06:44:21.066
One, for Title I, Part A, access to educators.

06:44:21.626 --> 06:44:35.093
Approve the proposed revision, but include clarification that the definition and approach to reporting data will account for statutory flexibility afforded to charter schools under state law.

06:44:36.857 --> 06:44:46.602
The second part of that first motion is then include option one for the title for part A in the revised plan instead of option two.

06:44:49.583 --> 06:44:53.425
Option one is the flexibility is to entitle.

06:44:54.505 --> 06:44:55.225
Yeah, title four.

06:44:55.306 --> 06:44:55.626
Sorry.

06:44:55.966 --> 06:44:56.186
Yeah.

06:44:57.326 --> 06:45:00.508
OK, so those two pieces, any.

06:45:02.290 --> 06:45:02.430
Yes.

06:45:02.690 --> 06:45:02.810
Okay.

06:45:02.870 --> 06:45:03.230
Question.

06:45:03.290 --> 06:45:03.571
Yeah.

06:45:03.631 --> 06:45:05.031
Do we have a second for the motion?

06:45:05.231 --> 06:45:05.711
I'll second.

06:45:05.731 --> 06:45:06.152
Okay.

06:45:06.172 --> 06:45:06.992
We have a second.

06:45:07.152 --> 06:45:07.572
Question.

06:45:08.192 --> 06:45:09.453
Ortiz-Lacombe.

06:45:09.573 --> 06:45:11.474
I have a question about the motion.

06:45:11.494 --> 06:45:25.099
And I know that we took Title 1A, Part A. But this attachment here, the only thing that I found that had concrete language that we would be adopting is Part 3 around the Spanish assessment, which I obviously agree.

06:45:25.560 --> 06:45:30.802
And I do agree that we need to incorporate feedback from the CPAC and stakeholders.

06:45:31.502 --> 06:45:40.426
But when you look at some of the comments and align it to the peer review criteria, but as I was looking through some of these comments, some of these comments contradict each other.

06:45:41.007 --> 06:45:47.250
And I have no idea what actually will go into that plan that will come back in August as a memo.

06:45:47.890 --> 06:45:51.755
So when something comes back as a memo, it's not a public comment period.

06:45:51.875 --> 06:45:52.576
It's a memo.

06:45:52.757 --> 06:45:53.918
It's a FYI.

06:45:54.158 --> 06:45:55.620
This is what we're proposing.

06:45:56.181 --> 06:46:03.090
So I still don't know what would actually be included in that plan because what I have is a list of

06:46:04.091 --> 06:46:11.799
raw comments that have been synthesized as best as possible, but that still don't tell me which one you're going to incorporate.

06:46:12.139 --> 06:46:15.883
Is it going to be the person that wants to recolor the grid?

06:46:16.263 --> 06:46:21.268
Is it going to be the person that wants to make it a five, a three year versus a seven year?

06:46:22.890 --> 06:46:26.713
So that level of detail, I don't know what I, it's like signing a blank check.

06:46:26.853 --> 06:46:28.974
I don't know what I'm actually approving.

06:46:29.375 --> 06:46:31.096
And it comes back to us as a memo.

06:46:31.176 --> 06:46:32.977
Again, it doesn't go out for public comment.

06:46:33.117 --> 06:46:40.783
It comes back as a memo where people could try to find an avenue to provide feedback, but it's not clear to me how somebody could give feedback on that memo.

06:46:41.463 --> 06:46:42.945
So can you please clarify that?

06:46:42.965 --> 06:46:43.205
Sure.

06:46:43.445 --> 06:46:43.785
Thank you.

06:46:43.825 --> 06:46:44.666
Thank you for that question.

06:46:45.146 --> 06:46:54.992
So our intent is to make the plan available, the revised plan reflecting your direction today, as an information memo early in August so we have plenty of time for everyone.

06:46:55.032 --> 06:47:04.757
As I mentioned, we've had a lot of stakeholders walking alongside us for the last 18 months as we've developed this plan, and we want to make sure that folks have enough chance to review.

06:47:05.398 --> 06:47:10.160
We do not intend to go out and do ESSA stakeholder engagement phase five.

06:47:10.180 --> 06:47:14.243
I don't think we have the time to really do that properly.

06:47:15.063 --> 06:47:29.872
But what we will do and include in as part of the memorandum is encourage folks to share their feedback on this draft with us at ssa.cde.ca.gov.

06:47:30.312 --> 06:47:39.478
And we will take letters and emails and any comments and synthesize those and present them, take them into account when we bring you the final plan in September.

06:47:43.896 --> 06:47:45.197
Is that, do you want to follow?

06:47:45.317 --> 06:47:49.318
I mean, I'm... Well, I followed up with the patient section.

06:47:49.338 --> 06:47:52.280
I know, I saw a lot of... Yeah, well, there's nothing in the plan now.

06:47:52.360 --> 06:47:53.200
I'm sort of lost.

06:47:53.320 --> 06:47:55.561
I mean, it sounds like there's no language.

06:47:55.741 --> 06:47:58.282
There's a whole, there's a whole plan.

06:47:58.342 --> 06:47:59.963
Yeah, well, that's what I mean.

06:48:00.003 --> 06:48:02.084
There's a whole bunch of quotes.

06:48:02.284 --> 06:48:05.285
No, so, yeah, there's no specific language.

06:48:05.705 --> 06:48:07.966
We haven't written specific language yet.

06:48:08.046 --> 06:48:12.528
But what we do have for each section is additional proposed revisions.

06:48:13.334 --> 06:48:18.258
So we're not planning to integrate all of the public comment, which, as you said, is often competing.

06:48:19.098 --> 06:48:28.165
We're planning to move forward as proposed in the section underneath the summary of feedback that goes to additional proposed revision.

06:48:28.245 --> 06:48:35.050
So if there are specific sections you wanted to look at, I'd be happy to look at what those specifically are.

06:48:35.630 --> 06:48:37.150
Well, that's exactly what I went to.

06:48:37.170 --> 06:48:38.511
I went to the recommendation.

06:48:38.611 --> 06:48:47.713
And again, the only language that I thought was concise and I had an understanding of what was actually being proposed was the Spanish assessment.

06:48:48.133 --> 06:48:52.273
Everything else, alignment to the peer criteria or the peer reviewer criteria.

06:48:52.954 --> 06:48:53.514
I've read it.

06:48:53.574 --> 06:48:54.814
I know what they're asking for.

06:48:55.274 --> 06:48:58.515
But, you know, I'm not sure we're going to align it.

06:48:58.575 --> 06:49:00.575
I don't know what parts we're going to align.

06:49:00.935 --> 06:49:04.396
So there's still that absence of language, concrete language.

06:49:04.858 --> 06:49:07.019
we do not have a whole new draft for you today.

06:49:08.559 --> 06:49:15.502
Our intent is to go create that whole new draft so everyone can see the new language and make that available as an information memorandum.

06:49:15.542 --> 06:49:18.123
That's the best we can do at this point.

06:49:22.464 --> 06:49:30.527
It is the motion because the motion is to accept the edits that will come back to us in May for all the parts except.

06:49:31.208 --> 06:49:31.348
No.

06:49:32.611 --> 06:49:33.252
to get input.

06:49:33.312 --> 06:49:37.695
But what's what's coming back to us is a memo in August.

06:49:37.855 --> 06:49:42.098
And then that will essentially will get some feedback if people submit.

06:49:42.159 --> 06:49:46.742
And that essentially becomes the plan that we will be approving in September.

06:49:47.463 --> 06:49:50.325
So, yes, we're going to go out and align it.

06:49:50.405 --> 06:49:57.511
So the motion is to go out and align it with some of the comments, some of the recommendations which don't are not specific there.

06:49:58.331 --> 06:50:04.566
Okay, well then can you please repeat the motion because, you know, when I first said, is this what we're voting on?

06:50:04.586 --> 06:50:05.528
I got a yes.

06:50:06.533 --> 06:50:11.715
So the motions are on some of the more substantive changes from what the draft is.

06:50:11.775 --> 06:50:18.297
There's a several parts of the draft that need additional language and CD staff because they haven't had the time.

06:50:18.337 --> 06:50:25.099
They just got all of the input to to actually draft specific language in some of those sections.

06:50:25.559 --> 06:50:30.861
So what but there are decision points that we are making under this motion.

06:50:31.701 --> 06:50:35.903
so that they can then fill out and fulfill the rest of the draft.

06:50:36.483 --> 06:50:51.149
So, I guess part of what I think member Laconis, Ortiz-Laconis is asking for is how will this be presented so that stakeholders have an opportunity to be able to provide more input.

06:50:51.269 --> 06:50:52.930
Is that what you're asking?

06:50:53.490 --> 06:50:55.313
That's part of it, but you said it yourself.

06:50:55.613 --> 06:50:57.936
They're going to go back and add detailed language.

06:50:59.118 --> 06:51:04.005
So there is no detailed language other than the sentence around the Spanish assessment.

06:51:04.445 --> 06:51:08.310
And the other thing that we are adopting is we're option one of title four.

06:51:10.393 --> 06:51:14.334
So you're right, we don't have a full plan that we're looking at.

06:51:14.554 --> 06:51:22.276
It might be helpful to really look at attachment one for a minute because I think there's actually more there than you are seeing right now.

06:51:22.696 --> 06:51:28.978
So I'm just looking and clearly for the assessment place there's very clear language that's been worked out in the collaborative process.

06:51:29.818 --> 06:51:46.152
We're going to talk a little bit more about accountability in a minute because that one was much more broad where, you know, we say we'll take into account the conversations you all had today around accountability and we'll talk about that a little bit more in a minute to get more clarity on specifically what we will include in the accountability section.

06:51:46.933 --> 06:51:51.557
For school improvement and support, we're looking on page 5 of 19.

06:51:53.218 --> 06:51:58.160
It says that it'll be updated based on board discussion regarding the emerging statewide system of support.

06:51:58.180 --> 06:52:08.105
So some of the things that you discussed earlier, like maybe beefing that up around root cause analyses and the other things that you recommended be included in the state system of support.

06:52:08.605 --> 06:52:14.108
And then to align it to those peer review criteria where again, staff will go through the peer review criteria and try

06:52:14.628 --> 06:52:19.194
to the greatest extent possible to meet but not exceed those criteria.

06:52:19.674 --> 06:52:23.659
For access to educators, there's actually a relatively long section.

06:52:23.719 --> 06:52:26.983
It starts on page 6 of 19 and goes through page 7.

06:52:31.462 --> 06:52:48.657
where that's actually some of the language and then we added a little bit more there that said we're going to get more specific in that table that's right in the plan so it's more clear what each of those terms encompass for school conditions starting on page 8 and going on to page 9.

06:52:49.518 --> 06:52:50.319
That's the language.

06:52:50.819 --> 06:52:58.265
that we want to include to augment that school conditions section to make it more clear about specific things that the state will do.

06:52:58.886 --> 06:53:03.189
And in addition, we'll go in and look at the peer review criteria and beef it up.

06:53:03.469 --> 06:53:09.835
So I could keep going through, but I think if you look at those proposed revision sections, wherever possible, we've tried to be

06:53:10.575 --> 06:53:15.439
as explicit as we can, because we are not starting from scratch.

06:53:15.899 --> 06:53:16.900
We have the plan.

06:53:17.420 --> 06:53:24.546
Our intent is to augment it, refine it, streamline it however appropriate to get closer to finished.

06:53:24.786 --> 06:53:28.169
We're not starting from scratch.

06:53:28.749 --> 06:53:32.252
We're building upon the draft we currently have.

06:53:32.372 --> 06:53:33.153
Is that helpful at all?

06:53:33.712 --> 06:53:34.592
I understand what you're saying.

06:53:34.632 --> 06:53:35.612
I also understand what I'm saying.

06:53:36.033 --> 06:53:40.674
What I'm saying is that I would, at this point, there's still a lot of questions that I would have.

06:53:41.394 --> 06:53:53.257
And so I personally do not feel comfortable voting on something that will come back to us in August where I don't know exactly how this will shape up.

06:53:53.357 --> 06:53:53.517
Right.

06:53:53.537 --> 06:53:56.858
So you're not, we're not asking you to approve a final plan today.

06:53:57.990 --> 06:54:02.614
Okay, I just want to be clear, you will see this plan again in September.

06:54:02.894 --> 06:54:09.459
You'll see it in August, but you'll have another chance to approve it before we submit it five days later.

06:54:09.499 --> 06:54:19.908
But as I said at the beginning of my remarks, just a few minutes ago, it serves us all well to get as close to final as we can around some of these big decisions today because

06:54:21.514 --> 06:54:29.039
If it's feeling like a lot of pressure now, I can't imagine what it's going to feel like on September 13th or 14th when we need to submit on the 18th.

06:54:31.160 --> 06:54:38.084
Yeah, just we're on a motion that concerns Title I, Part A, access to educators.

06:54:38.584 --> 06:54:40.045
It's the beginning part of the motion.

06:54:48.098 --> 06:54:48.458
Okay.

06:54:48.618 --> 06:54:49.399
All right.

06:54:49.439 --> 06:54:50.959
It's the beginning part of the motion.

06:54:51.080 --> 06:54:51.480
Okay.

06:54:52.520 --> 06:54:52.880
Thank you.

06:54:52.980 --> 06:54:53.241
Okay.

06:54:53.261 --> 06:54:56.182
I think board member Rucker was, I saw her first.

06:54:57.243 --> 06:54:57.543
Yeah.

06:54:58.163 --> 06:54:58.483
Okay.

06:54:58.503 --> 06:55:14.151
So I want to, first of all, thank you for all of the work that was done to get us to this point to be able to look at a draft and to have a long conversation about what our intentions are on doing the draft.

06:55:14.751 --> 06:55:19.033
I appreciate Board Member Ortiz-Lycone's concerns.

06:55:19.813 --> 06:55:31.178
She's, even though she's under the influence of mind-altering substances today, she definitely did make the, she is making the effort to stay woke on this conversation.

06:55:31.218 --> 06:55:32.419
So I appreciate that.

06:55:32.939 --> 06:55:36.763
I think that I want to clarify what we what the motion is saying.

06:55:37.023 --> 06:55:56.762
We have a draft plan and what the staff did today was an excellent job of looking at and articulating where there were some gaps not only between your understanding of what the peer review process has surfaced so far and what you've learned so you already know based on the feedback you've heard from other places in the peer review process

06:55:57.242 --> 06:56:01.868
There are some sections of the plan as drafted that needs to be punched up.

06:56:02.288 --> 06:56:12.781
So part of the motion is saying, based on what we're learning out of the peer review process, there will be some explicit revisions made to the plan draft.

06:56:13.101 --> 06:56:15.964
to align to that criteria.

06:56:16.504 --> 06:56:29.897
The second piece in what's in here is, as you went through each of the sections, and that was the attachment we got in attachment four, there were some specific recommendations for revisions that were enumerated

06:56:30.477 --> 06:56:31.617
in this blue memo.

06:56:32.058 --> 06:56:40.240
Some sections said no additional revisions are recommended and some sections said these are some of the changes we're going to make.

06:56:40.720 --> 06:56:46.662
So as it relates to attachment four, those are the revisions we will also see added to the memo.

06:56:47.372 --> 06:56:51.976
Now, in approving this, there were two additional changes made.

06:56:52.456 --> 06:57:03.366
For Title I, Part A, making sure that there's a clear, explicit recommendation concerning flexibility under the state law for teacher certification for charter schools.

06:57:03.446 --> 06:57:04.427
That was added.

06:57:04.747 --> 06:57:09.751
It was not something in the draft and it was not something enumerated in Attachment 4.

06:57:10.292 --> 06:57:12.433
And then for option, I mean, in Attachment 1.

06:57:13.414 --> 06:57:13.754
and four.

06:57:14.215 --> 06:57:26.125
And then for considering Title IV Part A, the recommendation for the staff that's in writing in our attachment recommended a competitive grant.

06:57:26.785 --> 06:57:32.230
The motion that is printed here is recommending the formula grant instead.

06:57:32.950 --> 06:57:48.648
So, if we vote on this motion and approve that, we are approving direction to the staff to revise the draft that we saw today so that the draft can be sent back out to the public

06:57:49.585 --> 06:57:50.145
as a memo.

06:57:50.825 --> 06:57:58.188
Now, and so this is the part that I think is not clear because it's actually not contemplated in the motion.

06:57:58.648 --> 06:58:03.850
Two things that you just said are going, well, you said one thing, but there's actually two things that are going to happen.

06:58:04.410 --> 06:58:17.894
Part of the reason why the memo in August is important is because that memo, which could be the draft that is submitted to the board for approval in September, still has to be reviewed and vetted by the governor's office.

06:58:18.254 --> 06:58:21.378
and there's a requirement for the governor's office to have 30 days.

06:58:21.739 --> 06:58:30.450
So it is important that the memo is prepared so that the board can send a draft for vetting for the governor's office.

06:58:30.911 --> 06:58:33.754
That additional vetting time for that memo

06:58:34.335 --> 06:58:44.220
gives the opportunity for stakeholders who have been monitoring this process to also give some feedback to the department through their submission window.

06:58:44.580 --> 06:58:50.122
Now, it does not mean that everything is going to be thrown out with the bathwater.

06:58:50.282 --> 06:58:56.185
It means it's another bite at the apple for one more opportunity to give some feedback.

06:58:56.265 --> 06:59:02.148
That feedback also includes the people on this dais as well when you receive the memo.

06:59:02.808 --> 06:59:08.731
Seeing the information memo in August does not mean the plan or draft itself is a done deal.

06:59:09.071 --> 06:59:17.715
Because the one real reality we need to remember, when we come back in September, the governor's office will also have given his input.

06:59:18.015 --> 06:59:22.097
And I'll just make the motion now, I accept any input the governor wants to give.

06:59:22.678 --> 06:59:24.098
Like you're really going to tell him no.

06:59:24.618 --> 06:59:24.779
So.

06:59:26.039 --> 06:59:29.260
So that's the other thing we have to recognize in this process.

06:59:29.300 --> 06:59:38.864
He will all his staff in his office will also be vetting the draft and also be giving their input and it will inform some changes that we will likely see in September.

06:59:39.244 --> 06:59:47.687
So that additional feedback loop is not contemplated in this motion, but it is still a step in the process.

06:59:48.047 --> 06:59:51.128
And I would suggest we actually don't need to enumerate that.

06:59:51.568 --> 06:59:56.529
in the motion, but I just want to make sure people understood that that's the next step in the process.

06:59:56.549 --> 06:59:59.390
Okay, thank you for that clarification.

06:59:59.430 --> 07:00:00.471
Board Member Holliday.

07:00:02.111 --> 07:00:13.714
Because this is not a new document that has gone through many iterations that we've worked on it forever and ever, I doubt that in September we will see something dramatically different than what we've seen today.

07:00:14.094 --> 07:00:15.675
However, in September,

07:00:16.474 --> 07:00:26.340
correct me if I'm wrong, we will have the option, even though there are only five days after the board meeting before we have to submit it, to say this particular line does not work for us.

07:00:26.660 --> 07:00:31.663
This phrase doesn't work for us or this piece doesn't work for us and be able to change it up at the last minute.

07:00:31.943 --> 07:00:40.268
So there still is a catch opportunity for us if there is something that steps out of line with what we've been talking about.

07:00:40.308 --> 07:00:42.129
But I certainly doubt that that's going to be the case.

07:00:44.048 --> 07:00:44.268
OK.

07:00:44.288 --> 07:00:46.849
Any further discussion?

07:00:46.869 --> 07:00:49.389
We're going to do everything.

07:00:49.409 --> 07:00:49.489
Yeah.

07:00:49.509 --> 07:00:52.310
So in the motion, it is just, it's nudging us along.

07:00:52.390 --> 07:01:02.872
So while you may not be completely satisfied with everything that is currently in here, the first part of that motion was, OK, this is enough to keep moving forward.

07:01:03.392 --> 07:01:04.952
So that is what the first part of the motion.

07:01:05.012 --> 07:01:12.954
And then I've got two sub-bullets under that for the access to educators and then for the Title IV Part A for Option 1.

07:01:14.722 --> 07:01:15.122
Okay.

07:01:15.702 --> 07:01:17.223
Any further board discussion on that?

07:01:18.503 --> 07:01:19.884
All those in favor, raise your hands.

07:01:20.944 --> 07:01:21.264
Okay.

07:01:21.304 --> 07:01:23.044
We have one no vote.

07:01:25.245 --> 07:01:26.445
That's one abstention.

07:01:26.606 --> 07:01:26.946
Okay.

07:01:27.646 --> 07:01:28.346
That carries.

07:01:28.626 --> 07:01:28.886
All right.

07:01:29.006 --> 07:01:31.387
Board member Sun, next.

07:01:31.869 --> 07:01:34.031
Okay, so the next one.

07:01:34.572 --> 07:01:38.515
All right, so this is on the title one part eight accountability section.

07:01:38.535 --> 07:01:51.447
I'm incorporating number one and number two of the staff recommendation reflected in attachment two to my motion with the additional direction to specify that we will consider plan.

07:01:52.148 --> 07:02:03.813
supplement to our January 2018 meeting to include additional details on the school identification methodology informed by the updated data in the fall 2017 dashboard release.

07:02:04.353 --> 07:02:06.234
So what that means is that

07:02:07.995 --> 07:02:12.801
We're approving the all applicable indicators option in Attachment 2.

07:02:14.042 --> 07:02:22.532
And we're approving the proposed baseline methodology for identifying the lowest performing Title I schools described in Attachment 2 as follows.

07:02:23.573 --> 07:02:25.414
Everyone's got this right, so you're following along with me.

07:02:25.434 --> 07:02:36.900
Okay, focus the identification of the schools under ESSA within LEAs identified for support under LCFF using the criteria that SBE adopted at its September 2016 meeting.

07:02:40.422 --> 07:02:48.706
add a new criterion to LCFF identification criteria, which would identify LEAs that have at least one very low performing school.

07:02:49.726 --> 07:02:55.649
The current definition of very low performing is all red and all red except one orange on the state indicators.

07:02:56.269 --> 07:03:00.671
So that was that baseline methodology that we initially we discussed.

07:03:03.752 --> 07:03:27.288
The next piece, three, is direct staff to prepare revised draft of the ESSA state plan that reflects number one and number two above and states that the SBE will consider a proposed plan supplement at the January 2018 meeting for submission to the Federal Department of Education that describes the approach for identifying schools beyond the baseline methodology.

07:03:27.468 --> 07:03:30.911
So that's that second tier that we need more baseline information on.

07:03:31.531 --> 07:03:46.101
The plan supplement will reflect more current data that will become available through fall 2017 dashboard release expected in early December and in early December, which will reflect the LEA's actual identified support under the state accountability system.

07:03:49.063 --> 07:03:55.567
Then four, approve the recommendation to revise the state plan to specify that California will use multiple

07:03:57.165 --> 07:04:03.475
icons to report the participation rate in the dashboard discussed by CDE.

07:04:04.577 --> 07:04:08.683
Five, approve the recommendation to revise the state plan to specify that.

07:04:10.171 --> 07:04:27.200
A, long-term goal will be set at a high status and maintain change green cell for all, for the required indicators with all blue cells and green cells to the right goal exceeding, right goal exceeding the goal and the very high and declined green cell meeting the goal.

07:04:28.480 --> 07:04:35.364
And then, and specify that the timeline for meeting long-term goals will be seven years.

07:04:38.906 --> 07:04:39.206
Second.

07:04:41.224 --> 07:04:42.365
Okay.

07:04:42.685 --> 07:04:45.488
Board member discussion on this one.

07:04:47.951 --> 07:04:49.192
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

07:04:50.473 --> 07:04:59.283
So for the LCFF criteria that would be used as the baseline methodology to filter, we're only looking at priority areas.

07:04:59.303 --> 07:05:01.325
We're not looking at the state indicators, correct?

07:05:04.071 --> 07:05:05.693
I'm sorry, can you, I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

07:05:05.813 --> 07:05:15.961
For 2A and B. So it says focus the identification of schools under ESSA with LEAs based on the criteria that's only through the priority areas, not through the state indicators.

07:05:16.201 --> 07:05:16.562
Correct?

07:05:16.642 --> 07:05:20.405
That's how we identify the lowest performing, the two red.

07:05:20.945 --> 07:05:22.647
Under LCFF, right?

07:05:23.027 --> 07:05:23.267
Right.

07:05:23.728 --> 07:05:28.612
So that would be for both, for A and B. As we're using LCFF criteria.

07:05:28.652 --> 07:05:29.693
Council has a comment.

07:05:32.782 --> 07:05:35.884
David Sapp, Deputy Policy Director for State Board of Education.

07:05:36.424 --> 07:05:47.911
So 2A in the motion, which talks about beginning with the districts or the LAs that are identified under the LCFF criteria, that's based on student group performance across the priority areas.

07:05:48.691 --> 07:06:04.719
2B in the motion then looks at the state indicators only using the all indicators approach that's been approved in one, sort of to identify that layer of schools, the very high need schools as Carrick described them.

07:06:05.099 --> 07:06:11.623
So that defines those schools using just the state indicators at the all student level.

07:06:12.623 --> 07:06:17.266
And then it looks up to see, okay, what LEAs are those schools located in and adds them.

07:06:17.386 --> 07:06:25.511
So it's basically the, we do the LCFF identification based on the existing criteria for student groups across priority areas.

07:06:26.091 --> 07:06:33.676
And then we look at the schools based on state indicators only and then bring in additional districts that those schools are located in or LEAs that those schools are located in.

07:06:33.696 --> 07:06:35.137
But all students, not subgroups?

07:06:35.477 --> 07:06:35.757
Correct.

07:06:38.259 --> 07:06:38.939
Board Member Rucker.

07:06:39.312 --> 07:06:51.767
So I want to make sure that I understand this based on and I'm going to make sure I understand what I think I'm voting on using a real-time example.

07:06:52.287 --> 07:06:56.732
And I'm going to use this district because I used to teach in this district and it no longer exists.

07:06:57.373 --> 07:07:20.185
So, this says that when we start looking for to identify the lowest performing schools, if the all applicable indicators option says the Del Paso Heights School District is a low performing district, it will be placed on that list based on that, based on the use of those indicators.

07:07:20.625 --> 07:07:26.508
Now, what two says is if the neighboring district like Washington Unified

07:07:27.068 --> 07:07:39.812
has, most of their schools are performing well, but we've identified a single school in that district that has the same kind of problems that we've identified.

07:07:39.872 --> 07:07:41.432
They meet this criteria.

07:07:41.452 --> 07:07:44.353
They're all red or all red except one orange.

07:07:44.814 --> 07:07:52.556
That one school in Washington Unified would be, would flag Washington Unified to be added to this list.

07:07:52.896 --> 07:07:53.677
Is that correct?

07:07:53.957 --> 07:07:55.658
The second part of what you said is correct.

07:07:55.758 --> 07:07:56.278
Okay.

07:07:56.318 --> 07:08:01.661
The Washington Unified example, the first part of it, though, isn't the all applicable indicators.

07:08:01.681 --> 07:08:01.801
Right.

07:08:01.861 --> 07:08:03.162
It's just the LCFF.

07:08:03.242 --> 07:08:05.023
It's just the LCFF criteria.

07:08:05.083 --> 07:08:09.626
And then just a final point to the question of looking, it's the all applicable, all

07:08:10.046 --> 07:08:15.591
applicable indicators at the all-student level at that second step, that's required by ESSA statute.

07:08:15.651 --> 07:08:18.734
It says the comprehensive support is all students.

07:08:19.235 --> 07:08:30.665
Targeted support, which is you apply whatever criteria get you to 5% at a minimum to student groups, but you have to start with the all-student performance for the 5% comprehensive support based on the ESSA statute.

07:08:30.685 --> 07:08:33.748
So that's what we've been sort of tracking is the federal law.

07:08:34.068 --> 07:08:54.764
So what item two in this motion does is it does not allow districts that are normally those high-flying districts that do very, very well because they have large groups of schools or students that perform very well, but there's a single school or a single collection of students that remain regularly underperforming.

07:08:55.325 --> 07:09:00.689
This indicator will flag that single school and as a result will flag that district.

07:09:01.129 --> 07:09:01.489
Correct.

07:09:01.609 --> 07:09:04.151
OK, that's that's the motion I think I'm voting for.

07:09:07.033 --> 07:09:08.314
Any further discussion?

07:09:08.734 --> 07:09:18.100
And I think just to say that by making this motion, we're I am not saying that this is the best thing since sliced bread and this is what it's going to be.

07:09:18.200 --> 07:09:18.360
Right.

07:09:18.420 --> 07:09:19.421
We made a commitment.

07:09:19.841 --> 07:09:20.041
Right.

07:09:20.681 --> 07:09:23.123
We have to put a stake in the ground to move forward.

07:09:23.243 --> 07:09:25.564
So this is stay in the ground to move forward.

07:09:25.584 --> 07:09:29.327
I think we've all made a commitment to continuously review

07:09:29.827 --> 07:09:40.624
our processes and refine our indices, look at data, and we are all very open to making those changes if we need to as we get more information.

07:09:40.704 --> 07:09:42.347
So this is the start.

07:09:42.667 --> 07:09:43.509
It is not the end.

07:09:45.248 --> 07:09:46.149
Thanks.

07:09:46.429 --> 07:09:46.629
Okay.

07:09:46.909 --> 07:09:47.970
Superintendent wants to come.

07:09:48.010 --> 07:09:55.234
Just a clarifying question under the motion number four on the median and 95% participation rate.

07:09:55.914 --> 07:10:00.096
Is it already in the guidance in the current draft?

07:10:01.917 --> 07:10:04.720
Or is it something that's assumed as part of the motion?

07:10:05.160 --> 07:10:10.725
There'll be communication with the district as inquiring as to why they didn't make the 95.

07:10:11.385 --> 07:10:16.610
So we get some kind of dialogue going to establish the basis for action on the icons.

07:10:19.332 --> 07:10:29.661
I know Carrick mentioned that the idea of corresponding with the districts that have not met the target inquiring as to what happened and what to do about it.

07:10:30.322 --> 07:10:35.511
Right, so in our discussion we talked about having a differentiated approach.

07:10:36.683 --> 07:10:39.686
depending on what percentage of participation they did have.

07:10:40.506 --> 07:10:46.111
That's not specifically, that won't be specifically spelled out in the ESSA state plan.

07:10:46.351 --> 07:10:52.876
What we'll put in the ESSA state plan is exactly what we need to put in the state plan according to our deposition rules.

07:10:53.516 --> 07:11:01.082
And, but we can have further conversation outside of the ESSA state plan about how we're going to address each of those.

07:11:02.063 --> 07:11:02.784
Okay, good.

07:11:03.784 --> 07:11:04.085
Thank you.

07:11:04.665 --> 07:11:04.885
Okay.

07:11:05.706 --> 07:11:06.867
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

07:11:07.988 --> 07:11:18.035
So again, under motion two, then this is still goes back to the earlier conversation where we're essentially having an asterisk and saying, make sure you close achievement gaps.

07:11:18.316 --> 07:11:22.219
But we're not telling them in motion two based on this methodology.

07:11:22.619 --> 07:11:24.080
We set our long term goals here.

07:11:24.801 --> 07:11:28.043
We identify our methodology for identifying the bottom five percent.

07:11:29.064 --> 07:11:34.268
We set our state determined timeline of seven years, but we're still not saying

07:11:35.836 --> 07:11:40.345
for in terms of narrowing achievement gaps, which is something clearly stated in ESSA, this is what we plan.

07:11:41.306 --> 07:11:41.587
Correct?

07:11:43.771 --> 07:11:44.352
Just making sure.

07:11:44.392 --> 07:11:44.612
Thanks.

07:11:50.185 --> 07:12:04.396
What I heard, yeah, yeah, I mean Carrick can come back up again if he wants, but what I heard Carrick say when we talked about this was the interim goals will be different for LEAs, but they'll be able to calculate it on their own knowing where they need to get in seven years.

07:12:04.756 --> 07:12:07.799
And we will provide guidance with how doing that.

07:12:08.459 --> 07:12:14.381
how it should be included in the LCAP, potentially how it's included in the addendum for the LEA plan.

07:12:14.441 --> 07:12:23.123
So it's not that we're not addressing it, and I get a little bit concerned that when we're having public conversations like that, that somehow we don't care about it.

07:12:23.604 --> 07:12:27.145
Of course we do, but it's different for each LEA.

07:12:27.565 --> 07:12:31.586
And so we're going to provide guidance for them to get to the long-term goal.

07:12:31.766 --> 07:12:38.108
With that guidance explicitly the goal of narrowing achievement gaps where they exist.

07:12:41.300 --> 07:12:41.620
Okay.

07:12:41.900 --> 07:12:42.781
Any further comments?

07:12:43.562 --> 07:12:47.984
It's not that we don't care, but if the language is not there, then that perception is reality for some.

07:12:48.465 --> 07:12:48.705
Thanks.

07:12:52.988 --> 07:12:53.408
Comments?

07:12:55.009 --> 07:12:55.289
All right.

07:12:55.349 --> 07:12:56.890
All those in favor say yeah.

07:12:57.771 --> 07:12:58.511
One abstention.

07:12:58.892 --> 07:13:00.413
That's a no.

07:13:00.453 --> 07:13:00.933
That's a no.

07:13:01.053 --> 07:13:01.333
Okay.

07:13:02.314 --> 07:13:02.934
All right.

07:13:03.775 --> 07:13:05.456
That concludes the item.

07:13:06.156 --> 07:13:06.937
Thank you very much.

07:13:07.097 --> 07:13:07.517
Okay.

07:13:07.677 --> 07:13:08.198
Good.

07:13:09.358 --> 07:13:09.679
Yeah.

07:13:09.779 --> 07:13:10.059
Go ahead.

07:13:11.092 --> 07:13:18.694
Back to motion one, it seems like we, I don't know for sure what we are doing with the state set aside for title four.

07:13:18.714 --> 07:13:25.155
Because we, I think Glenn started to talk about that when we said, well, let's give flexibility at the local level.

07:13:25.495 --> 07:13:28.636
And he actually handed out a document about where it could be.

07:13:28.976 --> 07:13:33.577
And I don't know if that's something we need to decide or that you have to describe that in the plan.

07:13:33.997 --> 07:13:34.177
Yes.

07:13:39.304 --> 07:13:40.646
So do we have any recommendations?

07:13:40.666 --> 07:13:45.231
That was some of the technical stuff that really didn't get a lot of attention in the public comment.

07:13:45.592 --> 07:13:56.745
But it is in, you know, some of that stuff does need to be drawn or made a little bit clearer in the plan because... The plan specifically asks how do you intend to spend your Title IV-A state level... Right.

07:13:56.806 --> 07:13:58.708
And so you're going to spell that out in the memo.

07:14:00.501 --> 07:14:03.746
Glenn, go ahead.

07:14:03.826 --> 07:14:11.096
If there is board direction now, I'd be happy to take it or else board members would like to send us comments and feedback.

07:14:11.517 --> 07:14:14.020
We could, you know, articulate a proposal in the memo.

07:14:20.151 --> 07:14:21.012
Well, no, no, no, no.

07:14:21.052 --> 07:14:28.457
So Glenn gave us a memo that explained about the issue of transferability for state level activities.

07:14:28.937 --> 07:14:38.264
And the question I believe that's being asked is, are we going to give the staff guidance about whether or not we want to transfer those funds out of Title IV Part A?

07:14:38.824 --> 07:14:48.171
into one of these other titles as enumerated on the handout or do we want the staff to just address the criteria that's established for the peer review.

07:14:48.571 --> 07:14:49.952
And I do want to stay on this part.

07:14:49.992 --> 07:14:58.858
I heard somebody during the public comment make a comment about transferring or moving the language concerning Title IV and including it.

07:14:59.438 --> 07:15:10.940
also in Title I. There was statute, there was bills that were signed by the governor last year concerning providing support for students who were incarcerated students who were transitioning in.

07:15:11.020 --> 07:15:23.383
So, I believe that that's already covered in the section concerning at-risk students and there's already responsibilities that LEAs have to address in their LCAPs if they have those students in their program.

07:15:23.923 --> 07:15:30.306
So the flexibility to do that is already something that's not only an existing state requirement, but I believe we can do that.

07:15:30.326 --> 07:15:36.590
But the question of what we want to do with the state funds, no recommendation has been made by this board.

07:15:37.310 --> 07:15:38.371
Okay.

07:15:38.391 --> 07:15:41.312
Speaking on the transfer, this just came up.

07:15:41.412 --> 07:15:43.033
I don't think we should settle this now.

07:15:43.213 --> 07:15:45.114
I think we have September.

07:15:45.174 --> 07:15:46.535
People have pointed this out.

07:15:46.575 --> 07:15:47.996
This is a brand new issue.

07:15:48.616 --> 07:15:51.437
I don't think at this point this is a good time to decide.

07:15:51.517 --> 07:15:53.458
It would be a little bit ad hoc to do it now.

07:15:53.758 --> 07:16:01.400
Yeah, and I think it's sort of complex and there's a lot of options and I'd like some time to think about it and not be forced here to decide it.

07:16:01.660 --> 07:16:06.602
The current draft of the plan, I believe, says that we would be using our Title IV Part A funds

07:16:07.182 --> 07:16:16.005
to support standards implementation, kind of to build on what's already happening in Title II and to support our state system of support, which is evolving.

07:16:16.465 --> 07:16:23.588
And Title IV-A is kind of, it's a little difficult to manage at the LEA level because it's a relatively small amount of money.

07:16:23.628 --> 07:16:28.289
So I think a lot of LEAs will take advantage of that transferability option.

07:16:28.809 --> 07:16:35.812
But for our state level funds, Title IV-A has a lot of flexibility around how you use that money.

07:16:36.892 --> 07:16:37.212
Right.

07:16:37.352 --> 07:16:46.377
So I, you know, I don't know that what's currently in the draft is necessarily the wrong way to go, but certainly we can bring it back to you for more conversation.

07:16:46.397 --> 07:16:47.357
We'll work with you on that.

07:16:48.258 --> 07:16:48.838
Bring it back.

07:16:49.799 --> 07:16:50.059
Thanks.

07:16:50.559 --> 07:16:53.361
OK, so that's the clarification.

07:16:53.581 --> 07:16:54.801
Now we can move on.

07:16:54.901 --> 07:17:01.765
OK, we're now on to item four, the California assessment of student performance and progress.

07:17:08.666 --> 07:17:09.466
Good afternoon.

07:17:09.486 --> 07:17:13.007
I don't have to say good evening, so that's the good news.

07:17:13.187 --> 07:17:20.629
Superintendent Torlakson, President Kerr, members of the board, I'm Michelle Senner, the director of the assessment division here at the department.

07:17:21.750 --> 07:17:37.334
I have before you today an item four, an action item that asks the board to direct the CDE to begin the process of approving a renewal of the Educational Testing Service, or ETS, CASP administration contract for an additional two years.

07:17:38.334 --> 07:18:01.330
Exercising the CDE's option to renew the current contract would allow for completion of the test development work for the California science test, the California alternate assessment for science, the California Spanish assessment, and also continued preparation, administration, reporting activities for the comprehensive CASP system for the 2019 and 2020 test administrations.

07:18:04.815 --> 07:18:19.846
Renewal of the current contract will include an amended scope of work, a timeline, and budget that will incorporate changes to allow the current contractor to administer score and report 2019 and 2020 CASP tests.

07:18:21.047 --> 07:18:24.909
The recommendation is to amend the contract end date from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2020.

07:18:30.003 --> 07:18:45.709
and to negotiate in conjunction with board staff and Department of Finance staff an amended scope of work to add those two testing administrations and to increase the overall budget by an amount not to exceed $157 million subject to appropriations.

07:18:50.905 --> 07:18:58.551
We also within that motion want to ensure the following activities are administered in the, are addressed in the amended scope of work.

07:18:59.551 --> 07:19:02.934
Ongoing administrations of all components of the CASP system.

07:19:03.754 --> 07:19:10.339
Technical work associated with preparing and administrating the operational assessments that are currently under development.

07:19:11.360 --> 07:19:16.964
Enhancements to the reporting system that will include increasing translations of student reports.

07:19:18.581 --> 07:19:25.405
We also want to research the option of adding paperless reporting options for our districts who are ready for that.

07:19:26.486 --> 07:19:35.132
Also additional enhancements to the technical hosting solution to allow us for future growth and scalability as we bring our new assessments online.

07:19:36.874 --> 07:19:48.460
The CDE anticipates presenting a draft of that contract that includes all the components I mentioned consistent with all of these recommendations to you for consideration no later than January 2018.

07:19:50.602 --> 07:20:03.889
I make this recommendation to you today because ETS and its subcontractors have met their existing contract requirements in terms of test administration and have successfully administered three operational summative assessment cycles.

07:20:05.899 --> 07:20:21.705
The recommendation is consistent with the current contract language that allows the CDE and the board, in collaboration with the board, to exercise an option to renew the contract for additional years as long as the costs are negotiated with the CDE, the SBE, and the Department of Finance.

07:20:22.645 --> 07:20:26.347
So that includes my summary, very quickly, because you've got a lot of work still to do.

07:20:26.867 --> 07:20:28.628
And I'm here to answer any questions.

07:20:28.788 --> 07:20:32.029
Oh, darn it, I meant to try and add wonk somewhere in there.

07:20:34.624 --> 07:20:54.397
But she's she's not at Hey the board member questions discussion on this we I'm sure we have public comment Okay, we'll take public comment Doug McCray I

07:20:55.319 --> 07:20:58.761
Good afternoon, I'm Doug McCrory, retired testing specialist from Monterey.

07:20:59.401 --> 07:21:07.806
I'd support the two-year extension, but I'd remind the board of the recommendations made for changes in the scope of work that were discussed at the May board meeting.

07:21:09.507 --> 07:21:13.790
Timely availability of technical reports has become more and more of a problem.

07:21:14.528 --> 07:21:20.715
Technical reports to the 2016 test administrations have yet to be released more than a year since completion of testing.

07:21:21.356 --> 07:21:25.660
Generally, such technical reports are available six to eight months after completion of testing.

07:21:26.401 --> 07:21:33.229
I suspect the delays are due to CDE reviews rather than ETS drafts, but in either case,

07:21:33.929 --> 07:21:42.252
The delays result in an unacceptable lack of transparency, as well as failure to make information available for accurate interpretation of CASP results.

07:21:43.293 --> 07:21:48.354
Board attention to this aspect is needed, including the coming scope of work.

07:21:50.935 --> 07:21:51.275
Thank you.

07:21:52.236 --> 07:21:54.277
All right, any further board discussion?

07:21:56.237 --> 07:21:56.597
Motion?

07:21:56.617 --> 07:21:59.579
I move the department's recommendation.

07:22:00.519 --> 07:22:00.819
Second.

07:22:02.591 --> 07:22:03.611
No further discussion.

07:22:03.671 --> 07:22:04.532
All those in favor?

07:22:04.552 --> 07:22:05.392
Raise your hands.

07:22:05.512 --> 07:22:05.912
Okay.

07:22:06.912 --> 07:22:07.733
Well, that's approved.

07:22:08.993 --> 07:22:14.014
Now we're on to item five, English Learner Roadmap Update.

07:22:16.115 --> 07:22:16.675
Oh, okay.

07:22:16.715 --> 07:22:17.896
Superintendent, do you want to?

07:22:17.916 --> 07:22:18.176
Thank you.

07:22:18.236 --> 07:22:25.838
As Veronica Aguila is coming forward to make a presentation this time, I just thought I'd take a moment to review how we got here.

07:22:26.418 --> 07:22:28.719
Short preface to looking back to the ELA

07:22:29.580 --> 07:22:36.963
ELD framework, which we adopted in 2014, which was cutting edge at the time and is still cutting edge.

07:22:37.043 --> 07:22:41.825
It's a nation-leading good strategy in combining those frameworks.

07:22:42.366 --> 07:22:44.626
And then the blueprint for great schools in 2015 called for a master plan.

07:22:49.169 --> 07:22:53.451
English Language Master Plan, which is now the EL roadmap.

07:22:54.352 --> 07:22:57.734
There was no funding, so we went to look for that funding.

07:22:59.055 --> 07:23:11.903
We went, took a visit to a great school, a dual immersion pre-K school in Redwood City, and met with the Sobrato Early Academic Language Program and a representative from the foundation.

07:23:12.723 --> 07:23:16.645
That led to discussions which led to the funding for this in 2016.

07:23:17.065 --> 07:23:31.570
So it's been a journey to get here, but I want to thank all those who helped along the way, especially the Sobrato Foundation and the English Learner Division, working with the larger community and education stakeholders to focus on English learners.

07:23:31.970 --> 07:23:32.350
Success.

07:23:33.871 --> 07:23:34.151
Veronica?

07:23:36.195 --> 07:23:36.956
Good afternoon.

07:23:37.076 --> 07:23:38.277
My name is Veronica Aguila.

07:23:38.297 --> 07:23:40.959
I'm the Division Director of the English Learner Support Division.

07:23:41.720 --> 07:23:48.825
And today I'm here to present item five, as Superintendent Torlakson mentioned.

07:23:48.925 --> 07:23:55.150
And I know it's been a long day, but hopefully this is one of those items that bring joy to the day.

07:23:55.170 --> 07:24:02.677
I am here to present the work of the and the recommendation of the California English Learner Roadmap Work Group.

07:24:03.898 --> 07:24:11.944
With me are Dr. Kenji Hakuta and Dr. Lori Olson, who co-chair the workgroup, and they will be coming up in a minute.

07:24:12.765 --> 07:24:18.050
Each will be presenting a few slides, as they both were co-chairs of this workgroup.

07:24:19.910 --> 07:24:33.415
I also would like to mention that we had the great privilege of having member Felisa Ortiz-Lincon as a liaison to this workgroup, and her input was invaluable, so we truly appreciate and are very grateful for her participation.

07:24:37.194 --> 07:24:45.880
With the State Board of Education leadership, with your leadership, California has met critical issues facing public education with strong leadership and teamwork.

07:24:46.761 --> 07:24:52.905
And as Superintendent Torlakson mentioned, this is the California way to work collaboratively, to work with a team approach.

07:24:53.285 --> 07:24:57.829
And I think after listening to the news, I am so glad that I live in California.

07:24:58.609 --> 07:25:00.010
I'm sure many of you are.

07:25:01.471 --> 07:25:10.281
The California way engages parents and communities as part of a collaborative decision making process around how to fund and implement this improvement efforts.

07:25:10.801 --> 07:25:20.331
The public relations that you see on this slide and many more are evidence of that collaborative process that you as a board have approved and provided guidance with.

07:25:21.312 --> 07:25:29.739
In 2015, the state superintendent published a blueprint for great schools 2.0, which led to this work group.

07:25:30.239 --> 07:25:36.945
In that blueprint, strategic priority 3.1 stated that we needed to have an English learner master plan.

07:25:39.170 --> 07:25:48.076
The word master plan has connotation for those people that have been around for a long time, like me, 31 years, of some types of compliance.

07:25:48.757 --> 07:26:00.025
And so instead of using that word, stakeholders, in the spirit of collaboration, decided the division of this work needed to have a different name, and it was renamed English Learner Roadmap.

07:26:01.167 --> 07:26:12.270
The design of this project was to harness the research, the practices and examples of evidence-based programs and services for English learners in one place to guide local education agencies.

07:26:13.251 --> 07:26:19.573
As Superintendent Torlakson mentioned, the California Department of Education successfully reached out to the Sombrero Foundation.

07:26:19.893 --> 07:26:24.514
And actually, the representative of the Sombrero Foundation family is here, Kenji Treanor.

07:26:25.555 --> 07:26:29.816
Somewhere in the back, I do want to recognize him for the funding this work.

07:26:30.925 --> 07:26:39.216
The department then developed an application process to identify representatives from the field to become partners in the development of the English Learner Roadmap.

07:26:40.017 --> 07:26:46.285
The department also invited other critical stakeholders to represent specific populations of English learners.

07:26:46.926 --> 07:26:55.612
And in December, you, the board, were provided with an update of the first meeting of the workgroup, indicating a link to the list of the workgroup members.

07:26:56.072 --> 07:27:03.517
The workgroup represents teachers, administrators, superintendents, and organizations whose mission includes the education of English learners.

07:27:05.697 --> 07:27:09.722
The composition of the work group was representative of key stakeholders.

07:27:09.782 --> 07:27:13.166
And you can see all those representatives in this slide.

07:27:13.186 --> 07:27:17.351
And I think everyone would agree that we had a fabulous think tank.

07:27:18.564 --> 07:27:31.654
The English Learner Roadmap Workgroup charge has been to provide guidance and recommendations to the development of the English Learner Roadmap, strengthening comprehensive education policies, programs, and practices for English learners.

07:27:32.554 --> 07:27:44.323
During the discussion, the group agreed that the EL Roadmap has to include a current policy regarding English learners, especially since the passage of Prop 58 back in November of 2016.

07:27:46.164 --> 07:27:59.620
It has to be supported by research and other guidance documents, and it has to feature or highlight effective practices from the field which are already successful and can be used as models that can be replicated.

07:28:01.516 --> 07:28:07.563
So the English Learner Roadmap Workgroup has met three times already, and the dates are on the slide.

07:28:08.424 --> 07:28:17.936
And during those three dates, the vision and mission statements were developed, the overarching principles that will guide programs and services for English learners, which are in your attachment one.

07:28:18.817 --> 07:28:21.079
and also the elements to enact each principle.

07:28:21.560 --> 07:28:23.722
The elements will be in the guidance document.

07:28:24.283 --> 07:28:33.772
The workgroup also developed the format for the forthcoming guidance document and the proposed policy, which is attachment one of your item today.

07:28:34.252 --> 07:28:40.679
And it's also here for your, the recommendation is for the board to adopt it.

07:28:43.345 --> 07:29:01.261
So to gather further input, the content of the English Learner Roadmap was shared with many in the field, in the Title III Accountability and Leadership Institute, at the public sessions and conferences and network meetings, the Bilingual Coordinators Network, and also presentations at the California Teachers Association.

07:29:02.001 --> 07:29:04.684
And the general consensus was really positive.

07:29:04.844 --> 07:29:06.865
Feedback concluded that the roadmap was needed

07:29:07.706 --> 07:29:12.469
a needed tool to move the needle forward to improve English learners.

07:29:12.949 --> 07:29:27.716
The input recommended that English Learner Roadmap include tools, crosswalks to other published documents, legal citations, and a crosswalk to the state priorities addressed in the local control and accountability plan.

07:29:28.017 --> 07:29:32.399
So all those recommendations and suggestions were incorporated.

07:29:32.759 --> 07:29:36.321
Based on the input and recommendations of the English Learner Roadmap Workgroup,

07:29:36.841 --> 07:29:47.846
Again, in comments from the public, the department recommends the State Board of Education adopt a proposed policy for English learners, as it's stated in item one.

07:29:47.866 --> 07:29:52.408
Now, I would like to introduce co-chair and lead writer of the proposed policy.

07:29:53.168 --> 07:29:59.631
As you're all aware of him, Dr. Kenji Hakuta, he's known expert in the English learner world.

07:30:00.071 --> 07:30:03.992
And to me, when I first became a teacher, and even now, he's still a rock star.

07:30:04.853 --> 07:30:05.193
Kenji?

07:30:06.775 --> 07:30:11.461
Yeah, it's a pleasure to welcome one of my faculty colleagues at Stanford.

07:30:11.902 --> 07:30:15.527
Yeah, it's the only time that we're in the same room, both wearing ties.

07:30:15.567 --> 07:30:16.348
Yeah, that's right.

07:30:16.949 --> 07:30:18.872
Well, mine's from a rental agency.

07:30:22.737 --> 07:30:24.960
So good afternoon, not yet evening.

07:30:24.980 --> 07:30:29.306
I really admire your stamina, fortitude.

07:30:29.326 --> 07:30:31.429
It's really remarkable.

07:30:31.849 --> 07:30:33.391
My name is Kenji Hakuta.

07:30:33.431 --> 07:30:39.359
I'm a professor emeritus from Stanford University and founder of the Understanding Language Initiative.

07:30:40.721 --> 07:30:53.150
I also have the honor of co-chairing with Lori Olson, the English Learner Roadmap Workgroup, and is the author of the document before you today.

07:30:54.672 --> 07:31:00.817
Having been around long enough to see changes in laws, and I guess I should emphasize I can't

07:31:01.517 --> 07:31:19.617
I can't figure out whether I should emphasize the long of the long enough or the enough of the long enough, but having been long enough to see changes in the laws and practice and thinking regarding how to provide English learner needs, I can honestly say that what was brought to the English Learner Roadmap Workgroup was the most current

07:31:20.217 --> 07:31:23.380
thinking available on the topic.

07:31:24.320 --> 07:31:36.210
Reflecting back to 1987, when I first came to California from New England, this is really night and day.

07:31:36.790 --> 07:31:45.957
We've really come a long ways from both the policies, the laws, the controversies, and the research underlying this work.

07:31:48.119 --> 07:31:49.301
Do I advance this?

07:31:50.902 --> 07:31:51.123
Yes?

07:31:52.164 --> 07:31:53.004
Let me try it here.

07:31:53.685 --> 07:31:54.086
There we go.

07:31:55.087 --> 07:31:55.947
Yeah.

07:31:56.288 --> 07:31:56.568
Whoops.

07:31:56.868 --> 07:31:57.209
Sorry.

07:31:58.951 --> 07:31:59.271
There we are.

07:32:00.765 --> 07:32:17.213
To undertake this project and to, I should say, go there, and to prepare the workgroup to have discussion on what to include and how to provide information in this document, we had to bring the research and practice, the law and guidance documents to the group.

07:32:17.433 --> 07:32:26.457
And this chart is a sampling of all the work that has been done recently that has been put forth for improving what we do in education.

07:32:26.477 --> 07:32:29.619
It was used to set the foundation for the working group.

07:32:30.859 --> 07:32:35.861
I won't belabor all of the points here, and we could actually make this even more complicated.

07:32:36.321 --> 07:32:59.088
And if you layer the history of where we've come, you can sort of see that it's a very complicated picture, but that really underscores the importance at this moment in time to really have a policy and guidance to pull this complicated picture together.

07:33:00.008 --> 07:33:06.131
Prop 58, for example, that you'll be discussing next on your agenda.

07:33:07.212 --> 07:33:11.934
The legal foundations on which all of this is based, the Castaneda principles.

07:33:13.135 --> 07:33:27.902
Clearly, the work that California has done in both the ELD standards and its correspondence and alignment to the Common Core, Next Generation Science Standards, all

07:33:28.482 --> 07:33:34.406
really important work in fully including English learners in this work.

07:33:34.466 --> 07:33:40.450
We considered all of that as well as the research foundations that undergird this.

07:33:41.751 --> 07:33:47.435
Back in 1997, I chaired a National Academy of Sciences committee that issued a report

07:33:48.315 --> 07:33:53.079
Most recently, the National Academy of Sciences issued an updated report.

07:33:53.320 --> 07:34:09.413
I was on this committee as well, somewhat shocked that 20 years had passed, but also pleased that there was a lot of research in there undergirding the work that went into our recommendations.

07:34:10.894 --> 07:34:16.797
The work group members were clear when they indicated they wanted to bring all of best thinking to a single usable tool.

07:34:17.357 --> 07:34:23.440
The resources of this tool needed to be presented in a way in which professional learning could best make use of content.

07:34:24.280 --> 07:34:28.642
The final English learner roadmap, sorry, to, oh.

07:34:30.586 --> 07:34:31.026
Where are we?

07:34:32.247 --> 07:34:32.668
Here it is.

07:34:32.888 --> 07:34:34.889
Okay.

07:34:35.990 --> 07:34:45.798
The final meeting of this work will primarily review and provide comment on the structure and refinement of the guidance portion of the English Learner Roadmap

07:34:46.440 --> 07:34:48.921
whether it be in print or an online tool.

07:34:49.701 --> 07:35:03.105
Currently, it's envisioned to be an online fountain of resources, and most importantly, case examples of actions taken by local education agencies that have made a difference for English learner achievement and well-being.

07:35:04.366 --> 07:35:13.969
Our final English Learner Roadmap Workgroup public meeting is scheduled for September 26th of this year at the Marriott Sacramento in Natomas.

07:35:15.374 --> 07:35:23.960
lovely location, and specific information can be found at the California Department of Education English Learner Roadmap webpage.

07:35:26.001 --> 07:35:32.025
We picture this guidance portion of the English Learner Roadmap to be developed, to be organized as indicated here.

07:35:35.259 --> 07:35:35.619
Here it is.

07:35:35.639 --> 07:35:38.861
Oops, sorry.

07:35:39.582 --> 07:35:39.942
Here it is.

07:35:40.702 --> 07:35:44.465
Part one would be the conditions that ripen the timing for this project.

07:35:45.525 --> 07:35:53.931
Part two would be the policy statement on what we as California believe about schooling English learners, meeting their needs, benefiting their diversity.

07:35:54.671 --> 07:36:11.640
And part three not only introduces the principles that guide and the elements that define our approaches, but would also provide case study examples of practices that local education agencies have instituted that are making a difference for English learners as the evidence-based practices we seek.

07:36:12.500 --> 07:36:22.825
And to give you further information, I'd like to introduce Dr. Lori Olson, who co-chaired this roadmap workgroup with me.

07:36:22.845 --> 07:36:23.826
Okay, great.

07:36:26.457 --> 07:36:27.038
Good evening.

07:36:27.598 --> 07:36:28.399
I'll just say it.

07:36:29.680 --> 07:36:34.804
First, to Tom, thank you very much for appointing me to co-chair with Kenji.

07:36:34.844 --> 07:36:39.828
It's really been an honor and an extraordinary journey of this past year.

07:36:41.089 --> 07:36:49.995
So what Kenji was presenting to you is basically the policy, and the policy is that vision, the mission that really sets California on the road toward

07:36:50.956 --> 07:37:07.265
towards serving our English learners in a way that is built around these four principles, the assets-oriented, needs-responsive schools, intellectual quality of instruction and meaningful access, system conditions that support effectiveness, and alignment and articulation within and across the system.

07:37:07.826 --> 07:37:16.110
And while that's the real meat of what we're asking you to pass today, which is the policy of the roadmap, in fact,

07:37:17.851 --> 07:37:29.485
What was very, very clear in all the input from the working group and from the field is that a policy is important to sort of set where we're going, but there's got to be good guidance that goes with it or this cannot be implemented.

07:37:29.545 --> 07:37:33.770
It is such a comprehensive view of what has to happen.

07:37:34.070 --> 07:37:37.595
We need real guidance for the field, guidance that's going to connect us to

07:37:38.375 --> 07:37:42.519
the work we're doing on our LCAPs and the kind of planning that's going on locally.

07:37:43.059 --> 07:37:56.350
And so we've envisioned this guidance piece as crucial and what we're asking of you today is to both adopt the roadmap but also then to direct the department to develop a guidance document.

07:37:56.390 --> 07:38:04.297
We want to share a little bit with you about what the nature of that is because it makes clear how this roadmap can work in the new California.

07:38:05.358 --> 07:38:14.103
So, this is the online version, just we're playing around with what that could mean, but you could see that it sort of lays out both the vision and the mission of the roadmap.

07:38:14.443 --> 07:38:25.350
It also has in it an invitation for people to be able to submit some of their practices locally that they feel are enacting the roadmap and can be shared with others.

07:38:25.710 --> 07:38:32.695
And you can see across the top that there are tabs for the research background, there are tabs for each of the principles, et cetera.

07:38:33.255 --> 07:38:37.418
So what they said was, we need good examples.

07:38:37.498 --> 07:38:39.239
We want to know that there's research behind it.

07:38:39.279 --> 07:38:43.722
We want to know how it maps onto the legal requirements for English learners, et cetera.

07:38:43.762 --> 07:38:48.685
But we want to know what people are doing that really is working and what are some good examples.

07:38:49.285 --> 07:39:03.627
And so you'll see here, this would be the tab for Principle 2, Intellectual Quality of Instruction and Meaningful Access, and it includes a set of elements that get more descriptive about what that policy and what that principle means.

07:39:04.548 --> 07:39:16.835
For example, on this one, the elements include instructional scaffolding and language development integrated across the curriculum, and access to the full curriculum, and a set of things that get more specific.

07:39:17.195 --> 07:39:22.298
But then what they can tap on from there is, what is it people are doing in the field?

07:39:23.538 --> 07:39:29.502
In addition to that, there will be a very clear cross map, cross walk to the LCAP principles.

07:39:29.902 --> 07:39:37.807
And this was both something that we used in the development of the roadmap, the design of the roadmap, and something that will be a very intentional tool for the field.

07:39:37.867 --> 07:39:38.488
So you could see

07:39:39.008 --> 07:39:40.590
People can approach this either way.

07:39:40.630 --> 07:39:53.183
We're working on our LCAP priority around school climate, which are the elements and the principles in the roadmap that really speak to that, that we can click on, get the research, get the examples, etc.

07:39:53.603 --> 07:39:55.005
Or it might work the other way.

07:39:55.065 --> 07:39:57.928
We're working on principle number three on system conditions.

07:39:58.368 --> 07:40:02.630
what needs to be appearing across the LCAP priorities to really build that.

07:40:03.050 --> 07:40:12.694
And so that was very intentional and it was very clear request and need from the field because this roadmap needs to map onto the work people are doing locally.

07:40:15.815 --> 07:40:17.995
I'm just going to skip because of the interest of time.

07:40:18.435 --> 07:40:24.457
And finish by saying, taking one little moment to mark what I believe is this historic moment.

07:40:24.597 --> 07:40:27.458
And Veronica said this might be a moment of joy for us.

07:40:27.818 --> 07:40:30.359
It's also a deeply emotional moment in some ways.

07:40:30.839 --> 07:40:43.497
There have been times in the past when California has stepped into national leadership in English learner education, including more recently, things like the CELA Biliteracy, our groundbreaking combined ELA-ELD framework.

07:40:44.679 --> 07:40:47.143
I believe that the adoption of the English learner roadmap

07:40:47.443 --> 07:40:52.267
which supersedes the 1998 policy, is such a moment for our state.

07:40:52.688 --> 07:40:54.509
And we should take great pride in that.

07:40:54.990 --> 07:41:01.496
It is finally a turn away from the English only, deficiency oriented approach to English learner education.

07:41:01.916 --> 07:41:11.705
And it breaks new ground by providing real asset based, coherent, comprehensive commitment to our English learners, providing both for our own students,

07:41:12.145 --> 07:41:21.713
real equity, real access, and at the same time being able to offer to the nation, as we've done before, a real groundbreaking vision of what could be.

07:41:21.873 --> 07:41:23.675
We're offering them the California way.

07:41:24.215 --> 07:41:30.440
I could not be more thrilled and honored and moved to be at this moment and to be part of this effort.

07:41:30.680 --> 07:41:37.126
And I want to thank you, Tom, for your leadership in getting us here and to the board for what I hope will be your adoption of the roadmap.

07:41:39.241 --> 07:41:40.362
Veronica.

07:41:40.823 --> 07:41:42.244
Thank you.

07:41:42.544 --> 07:41:44.526
Veronica, you're going to close it out.

07:41:45.007 --> 07:41:45.207
Yes.

07:41:45.868 --> 07:41:49.291
I would like to restate the recommendation that is before the board.

07:41:49.852 --> 07:42:02.225
The California Department of Education respectfully recommends the State Board of Education adopt as the English learner policy, the California English learner roadmap policy, educational programs and services for English learners, which is attachment one.

07:42:02.845 --> 07:42:10.090
Upon approval of the policy, the department will continue to complete the guidance document and resources and incorporate the policy in the guidance document.

07:42:10.410 --> 07:42:14.533
And no further action would be required on the guidance document from the board.

07:42:15.193 --> 07:42:18.396
If there are any questions, the co-chairs and I are happy to answer them.

07:42:19.596 --> 07:42:20.037
Thank you.

07:42:20.217 --> 07:42:23.739
Thanks for the presentation and board member comment.

07:42:25.200 --> 07:42:26.321
Board member Ortiz-Lacon.

07:42:28.348 --> 07:42:31.330
I think this is such a great way to close a very intense day.

07:42:32.030 --> 07:42:38.553
I was a part of this work group, and I want to just add a personal note to this because I think it's pretty surreal.

07:42:39.254 --> 07:42:42.755
And I've shared this with some of the members of the committee of the work group.

07:42:43.196 --> 07:42:46.937
I was a student at UCLA, a student activist, protesting Prop 227.

07:42:49.139 --> 07:42:51.980
when it passed in 1998.

07:42:53.001 --> 07:43:13.532
And so it's humbling and it's an honor to now sit here and be part of the decision-making to pass a policy that would supersede that policy that was adopted in 1998, which really, as a Latina, as a bilingual learner, as an English learner, tried to strip me of my language.

07:43:13.772 --> 07:43:16.354
And it just brought me stronger to this place.

07:43:17.734 --> 07:43:18.174
Excuse me.

07:43:20.735 --> 07:43:21.275
I'm sorry.

07:43:21.836 --> 07:43:33.479
To have that personal connection to policies that aim to really engage in subtractive schooling of who I was as a student and not validate my experience and my assets.

07:43:34.119 --> 07:43:40.642
I'm so grateful to God and to everyone else that allowed me to be at this place to now reverse that.

07:43:42.242 --> 07:43:49.249
And it was done in such a collaborative way with a cohort of high caliber EL experts in a very in-depth way.

07:43:49.829 --> 07:43:56.415
We sat around, we talked, there was respectful disagreement, and I think it was

07:43:57.336 --> 07:44:14.520
a very thorough process so I want to congratulate the department and I want to thank everyone the co-chairs and everybody that participated in making sure that we bring we reinstate dual language opportunities for our students including my two kids who were here earlier just couldn't hang beyond 45 minutes.

07:44:18.141 --> 07:44:22.502
And I'm very excited for this so I wholeheartedly support the recommendation.

07:44:26.380 --> 07:44:27.081
Public comment?

07:44:27.261 --> 07:44:28.542
We're ready for public comment.

07:44:31.023 --> 07:44:32.825
Would the following people please line up?

07:44:33.965 --> 07:44:51.277
Judy O'Loughlin, Carly Aguilera-Fort, Carla Herrera, Vicky Ramos-Harris, Marta Hernandez, Shelley Spiegel-Coleman, Martha Alvarez, Shalonen Cruz-Gonzalez, and Lorraine Richards.

07:44:51.938 --> 07:44:54.940
Before they start, the State Superintendent would like to make a statement.

07:44:55.453 --> 07:44:56.734
Thank you, President Kirsten.

07:44:57.074 --> 07:44:59.075
Thank you all who've been part of this process.

07:44:59.675 --> 07:45:05.278
Veronica, you and your team and the English Learners Division are just fabulous, A+.

07:45:05.739 --> 07:45:10.381
Felicia, thanks for your participation and bringing the voice of the board and your own experience to bear.

07:45:12.322 --> 07:45:29.831
Lori, Kenji, Kabe, Californians together, just a lot of teamwork and a lot of real thoughtful visionary work that I'm grateful to see this moment to where we have the public to interact and then we have action to take with some real good guidance to move it forward.

07:45:30.491 --> 07:45:31.512
So thanks all around.

07:45:38.971 --> 07:45:41.553
Hello, I'm Judy O'Loughlin for CATEISL.

07:45:42.673 --> 07:45:48.257
We're no longer in the era of English only, which is encoded in Proposition 227 policy.

07:45:48.897 --> 07:45:52.459
We're no longer in the 20th century in the era of No Child Left Behind.

07:45:53.000 --> 07:46:00.044
We need to bring California policy and programs in alignment with the new ELA-ELD standards and framework 21st century goals.

07:46:00.524 --> 07:46:04.647
This is the most recent research on effective and evidence-based practices.

07:46:05.467 --> 07:46:07.749
The interrelated alignment of standards

07:46:08.649 --> 07:46:16.651
forms the basis for instructional practice promoting literacy through critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and communication.

07:46:17.052 --> 07:46:22.053
It provides guidance to educators to help build depth of knowledge on a range of topics.

07:46:22.193 --> 07:46:34.136
Proposition 58, a mandate for language programs leading to literacy in multiple languages, addressing a wide range of language needs, flexibility in curriculum, lessons, and classroom assessments.

07:46:34.676 --> 07:46:35.757
So we support this.

07:46:36.117 --> 07:46:36.417
Thank you.

07:46:41.213 --> 07:46:41.873
Buenas tardes.

07:46:42.154 --> 07:46:42.654
Good evening.

07:46:43.014 --> 07:46:45.935
Carlin Aguilera Ford, bilingual special ed teacher.

07:46:46.135 --> 07:46:50.597
I was in the classroom teaching bilingual special ed when 227 passed.

07:46:51.518 --> 07:46:56.680
And I'm currently assistant superintendent in the San Francisco Unified School District.

07:46:57.220 --> 07:47:03.123
And I am representing the CABE Board of Directors and the immediate past president of the CABE Board of Directors.

07:47:03.643 --> 07:47:10.006
Definitely, I am speaking on behalf of CABE to support

07:47:10.987 --> 07:47:12.568
the English learners roadmap.

07:47:12.668 --> 07:47:24.481
As an English learner myself, I know exactly the importance of having guidance and having clear perspective about the research that support the best practices for English learners.

07:47:24.822 --> 07:47:31.950
So we actually urge you as CABE to the board to actually adopt this policy.

07:47:32.490 --> 07:47:58.523
We also would like to ask you to actually direct the staff to provide guidance, specific tools, case studies that will support the local agencies to implement this policy with fidelity and not something that it will be misconstrued, but having the research, having the policy, having the examples, having the templates will help us at the local level.

07:47:58.783 --> 07:48:01.845
So, thank you and CABE supports the EL roadmap.

07:48:02.068 --> 07:48:02.361
Thank you.

07:48:07.964 --> 07:48:10.785
Hello, Vicky Ramos-Harris with Advancement Project California.

07:48:11.885 --> 07:48:18.148
Board member Aitu was out there protesting Proposition 227 and this is an important day for me as well.

07:48:20.048 --> 07:48:32.393
So we're here to support the work on the English learner roadmap and how it leverages the research on early childhood education and the need to invest in early learning as an aligned and articulated pathway for English learners.

07:48:33.073 --> 07:48:45.860
Over the past decade, California has worked diligently to build investments in early education, and we have also learned tremendously about the neuroscience and research on the critical window of language learning in the early years.

07:48:48.044 --> 07:48:59.347
So it is imperative that we meaningfully create aligned, articulated pathways for English learners across this crucial developmental period of language development between birth and age eight.

07:48:59.827 --> 07:49:07.789
The Roadmap explicitly does this and builds connections to early childhood in its vision and its principles.

07:49:08.330 --> 07:49:16.832
The Roadmap promotes the very articulation and alignment that is called for in the recent National Academies of Science and Medicine, and we give our full support.

07:49:16.872 --> 07:49:17.192
Thank you.

07:49:22.864 --> 07:49:25.546
Good afternoon, Carla Herrera, retired educator.

07:49:26.887 --> 07:49:38.776
As a passionate bilingual educator and specialist for over four decades, I participated in multiple state, county, district, and local initiatives to support English learners, their families, documents, and programs.

07:49:39.577 --> 07:49:44.000
I am an alternate to this work group, and I've been following the work.

07:49:44.120 --> 07:49:48.584
And I'm thrilled to ask that you please adopt the EL roadmap as policy.

07:49:48.844 --> 07:49:49.765
This is very emotional.

07:49:50.305 --> 07:50:02.996
As a former IQC member while California developed our historic combined ELA-ELD framework, I appreciate our nationally recognized seal of biliteracy building the focus of English learners into the local

07:50:04.102 --> 07:50:11.986
control funding and planning system and engaging in multiple exciting initiatives to support 21st century global education.

07:50:12.307 --> 07:50:18.410
What we need now in the field is a comprehensive approach to build coherence across all of the separate pieces.

07:50:18.850 --> 07:50:30.617
The four principles of the proposed DL roadmap policy are important because they connect all the important separate efforts into an integrated set of principles, tying together a commitment to meaningful access

07:50:31.657 --> 07:50:34.378
And I just want to thank you for this opportunity.

07:50:34.459 --> 07:50:34.719
Thank you.

07:50:39.201 --> 07:50:48.926
I'm Martha Hernandez, assistant superintendent of Fillmore Unified School District, also a past president of the California Association of Bilingual Education.

07:50:49.826 --> 07:50:56.249
And my dirty little secret is that I was on the board when Proposition 227 passed.

07:50:56.329 --> 07:50:57.350
It was on my watch.

07:50:57.810 --> 07:50:59.551
So today is a glorious day.

07:51:00.916 --> 07:51:04.437
I'm also the president of the Yorona club, so you have to.

07:51:06.337 --> 07:51:11.939
And so I, of course, urge the adoption of the EL roadmap as board policy.

07:51:12.519 --> 07:51:22.381
The English learner roadmap clearly moves towards operationalizing the vision of the California state seal of biliteracy, the intent

07:51:23.161 --> 07:51:28.865
of the EDGE initiative and research about the benefits of biliteracy.

07:51:29.426 --> 07:51:36.371
This is a vision and bar appropriate for California, one of the most diverse states in the union.

07:51:37.111 --> 07:51:44.256
And so I thank you and urge your adoption of this wonderful policy.

07:51:44.537 --> 07:51:44.897
Thank you.

07:51:49.198 --> 07:51:49.838
Good afternoon.

07:51:50.218 --> 07:51:51.819
My name is Xiloni Cruz-Gonzalez.

07:51:51.859 --> 07:51:54.100
I'm a school board member in Azusa Unified School District.

07:51:54.120 --> 07:51:59.963
I'm also the director for Californians Together, a project entitled Educator Support for Immigrant and Refugee Students.

07:52:00.903 --> 07:52:08.726
Now more than ever, this roadmap is needed because of its asset-based approach and call for welcoming climate and commitment to English learner access and participation.

07:52:09.086 --> 07:52:17.330
I especially want to recognize Superintendent Torlakson and his staff for taking the lead eight months ago, sending out a letter and just being very vocal about safe haven school districts.

07:52:18.170 --> 07:52:24.915
I know across the street, AB 699 is working its way through that would offer protection in all school districts for our students.

07:52:25.555 --> 07:52:32.740
And finally, I'm very proud of my own organization, CSBA, who offered legal guidance, sample resolution, and policy on this issue.

07:52:33.300 --> 07:52:40.305
So the adoption of the EL roadmap symbolizes in many ways a further step of our state leadership by framing the EL education as asset-based.

07:52:40.925 --> 07:52:48.070
being explicit about building a welcoming climate for our driver's climate communities, and clearly stating a commitment to meaningful participation and access.

07:52:48.390 --> 07:52:49.011
So I thank you.

07:52:49.611 --> 07:52:50.071
Have a good day.

07:52:53.874 --> 07:52:54.955
Shelly Spiegel-Coleman.

07:52:58.527 --> 07:52:59.588
Couldn't have passed my name.

07:53:03.433 --> 07:53:07.597
Anyways, Shelly Spiegel Coleman, an alternate on the roadmap committee.

07:53:08.458 --> 07:53:11.963
Who would have thought that we would have lived to see this day?

07:53:13.100 --> 07:53:35.505
that California would rescind the English learner policy stemming from Proposition 227 and replace it with a policy in the form of an English learner roadmap, guided by research, evidence-based, and successful practices, and that looks at languages as assets and not as a barrier.

07:53:36.545 --> 07:53:41.186
For many of us, your vote today is going to be a very historical moment.

07:53:42.186 --> 07:53:56.221
We want to thank Superintendent Torlakson, who for seven years has been advocating for English learners and had the wisdom to go to the Sobrato Family Foundation to help create the roadmap that we have before us today.

07:53:57.113 --> 07:54:08.876
We also want to thank Tom Adams, Veronica Aguilar, and Elena Fajardo for their inspiring, inspiring leadership to a very capable committee that created this document.

07:54:09.436 --> 07:54:10.617
And lastly, Drs.

07:54:10.737 --> 07:54:14.458
Lori Olson and Kenji Hakuta were the most amazing co-chairs.

07:54:14.958 --> 07:54:22.064
They brought their expertise, their years of experience, knowledge of research and practice to bring us here today.

07:54:22.624 --> 07:54:35.935
Schools and districts will be able to look to the policy and the guidance materials as they review their LCAPs and find direction for improving and increasing services for English learners in California.

07:54:36.516 --> 07:54:36.876
Thank you.

07:54:40.879 --> 07:54:43.801
Hello, Lorraine Richards, California Teacher Association.

07:54:44.321 --> 07:54:49.425
My next 26 words are not going to be tear jerking, so I will allow you to dry up for a bit.

07:54:51.026 --> 07:54:58.632
So CTA recommends the board adopt the California English Learner Roadmap State Board Education Policy.

07:54:58.672 --> 07:55:03.475
We strongly support providing more opportunities for students to learn in their native language.

07:55:08.342 --> 07:55:10.864
Good afternoon, Marta Alvarez on behalf of AXA.

07:55:11.084 --> 07:55:19.611
As a long-term and forever English learner, I'm very pleased to be here today to express AXA support, strong support for this staff recommendation.

07:55:20.051 --> 07:55:24.535
We thank the city staff for taking the time in engaging stakeholders in developing this policy.

07:55:25.095 --> 07:55:35.361
And we echo the comments made by prior speakers regarding the importance of ensuring that the policy gets turned into practice to ensure that the practitioners can really take it into consideration at their local level.

07:55:36.062 --> 07:55:42.966
ACCESS stands ready to lend our support in making sure that the policies and guidance gets out to the field.

07:55:43.587 --> 07:55:44.907
So let us know how we can be of help.

07:55:44.987 --> 07:55:45.608
It's important.

07:55:45.808 --> 07:55:50.111
More than 1.2 million kids are out there, and hopefully one day they can be here like myself.

07:55:50.371 --> 07:55:50.651
Thank you.

07:55:55.287 --> 07:55:59.830
Good afternoon, Martha Ceregoza-Diaz representing CABE and Californians Together.

07:56:00.611 --> 07:56:06.575
Having lived through all the years of Proposition 227 and representing English

07:56:19.182 --> 07:56:25.743
and representing English learners before three different state boards of education since that time.

07:56:26.463 --> 07:56:32.665
Today is a very historic moment for all the reasons given by my colleagues.

07:56:32.985 --> 07:56:37.886
This is indeed a historic moment and I request your adoption.

07:56:39.046 --> 07:56:42.026
Sorry, it is very emotional for me.

07:56:42.787 --> 07:56:44.267
Those were very turbulent times.

07:56:45.467 --> 07:56:56.298
I request your adoption of the EO roadmap and the directive to the department to develop guidance for the field regarding English learners, especially in light of the passage of Proposition 58.

07:56:56.338 --> 07:56:56.618
Thank you.

07:57:02.984 --> 07:57:03.324
Thank you.

07:57:03.524 --> 07:57:04.365
I'm Andrea Ball.

07:57:04.405 --> 07:57:14.989
I'm here today on behalf of the Central Valley Education Coalition, a coalition of county superintendents and district superintendents in the part of our state with a high proportion of English learners.

07:57:15.990 --> 07:57:20.552
We support the policy and the guidance and urge your adoption of moving this forward.

07:57:21.532 --> 07:57:24.994
The policy is really clearly written.

07:57:25.254 --> 07:57:30.997
I think it's accessible to educators in the field as well as state policymakers.

07:57:31.937 --> 07:57:41.143
And I think it's a great combination of research and practice and will really be helpful to the schools and districts in the Central Valley and really across the state.

07:57:41.624 --> 07:57:49.369
And I also want to say I want to thank the department staff, superintendent, the co-chairs for the workgroup meetings.

07:57:49.669 --> 07:57:51.610
I attended them as a participant.

07:57:51.930 --> 07:57:53.431
They were very open.

07:57:53.812 --> 07:58:01.657
We did have respectful disagreements, but in a tone that was so positive and I think really resulted in a very valuable document.

07:58:02.037 --> 07:58:02.397
Thank you.

07:58:06.220 --> 07:58:08.901
Terry Burns for the California School Boards Association.

07:58:09.101 --> 07:58:21.809
I want to express our enthusiastic support for the policy and want to pledge to you our commitment to help disseminate this and any recommendations you have on implementation to all the school boards throughout the state of California.

07:58:22.029 --> 07:58:22.309
Thank you.

07:58:26.260 --> 07:58:28.322
Well, that was memorable public comment.

07:58:28.422 --> 07:58:34.587
I've been here six and a half years and no public comment like that.

07:58:34.667 --> 07:58:36.149
That was really something.

07:58:36.249 --> 07:58:38.511
So any more board discussion?

07:58:38.631 --> 07:58:43.115
I think we've had some great words.

07:58:44.761 --> 07:58:45.121
All right.

07:58:45.201 --> 07:58:52.347
Well, I just want to say since everyone has been talking about this, so many of you mentioned 227.

07:58:53.228 --> 07:58:56.631
I was an English learner before there was any such thing as an English learner.

07:58:56.931 --> 07:59:00.554
We were just simply invisible children in the back of the classroom.

07:59:01.074 --> 07:59:07.960
So I'm very, very, very happy to see this and will enthusiastically support.

07:59:09.121 --> 07:59:10.882
And I don't want to take the motion away from you, so.

07:59:14.926 --> 07:59:19.429
I motion to move the department's recommendation and I will second.

07:59:19.449 --> 07:59:20.970
Okay.

07:59:21.070 --> 07:59:24.192
It's moved and seconded and seeing no further discussion.

07:59:24.412 --> 07:59:24.972
Here we go.

07:59:25.113 --> 07:59:26.093
Raise your hand high.

07:59:26.313 --> 07:59:26.613
Yeah.

07:59:36.359 --> 07:59:36.720
All right.

07:59:36.740 --> 07:59:37.060
Yeah.

07:59:37.320 --> 07:59:38.220
Thanks for sharing that.

07:59:38.601 --> 07:59:40.102
I didn't know that.

07:59:40.182 --> 07:59:40.522
Okay.

07:59:44.645 --> 07:59:45.105
Okay.

07:59:45.425 --> 07:59:51.647
Well, now we have the item six, which is more of administrative and formal of getting this process going.

07:59:53.988 --> 07:59:54.989
Go ahead, Veronica.

07:59:55.009 --> 08:00:06.433
Trying to bring the PowerPoint up, but... Yeah, it's the California Education for Global Economy Initiative.

08:00:06.453 --> 08:00:06.633
Right.

08:00:07.173 --> 08:00:10.574
So if I can't bring it up, I'll just speak to it.

08:00:18.578 --> 08:00:19.038
Where is it?

08:00:19.358 --> 08:00:19.718
I'm sorry.

08:00:20.959 --> 08:00:23.660
Yeah, it's also here.

08:00:32.502 --> 08:00:33.983
I could just speak to it.

08:00:35.883 --> 08:00:40.345
So I have the great pleasure to speak about item six.

08:00:43.621 --> 08:00:48.102
Again, for the record, my name is Veronica Aguila, Division Director of the English Learner Support Division.

08:00:49.602 --> 08:00:53.463
Today, it's monumental in two ways.

08:00:53.763 --> 08:00:59.784
The Yale Roadmap and now Prop 58, we're commencing the rulemaking process for Proposition 58.

08:01:00.044 --> 08:01:04.285
That's the recommendation that we're making to the board to open that process.

08:01:05.465 --> 08:01:09.846
As I mentioned before, I became a teacher about 31 years ago and the reason

08:01:11.069 --> 08:01:12.030
Let's see if I move over here.

08:01:13.511 --> 08:01:16.773
The reason I became a teacher was to make a difference in a child's life.

08:01:16.873 --> 08:01:19.655
And I'm sure a lot of you, that's why you became a teacher.

08:01:19.675 --> 08:01:24.439
And not just on the bilingual child's life, but every single student.

08:01:24.779 --> 08:01:30.323
And I think Proposition 58 is also doing that because it recognizes the value of multilingualism.

08:01:31.264 --> 08:01:39.272
So, as you know, in November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 58, which is better known as the Global Economy California EDGE Initiative.

08:01:39.793 --> 08:01:42.255
This initiative was passed in the legislature by over 70%.

08:01:42.295 --> 08:01:44.117
The voters voted on November 8th of 2016.

08:01:44.157 --> 08:01:46.700
Over 70% of the voters approved that initiative.

08:01:53.346 --> 08:02:03.448
And so what we're bringing to you is the initiative is amending Education Code Section 300, 305, 306, 310, 320, and 335.

08:02:04.168 --> 08:02:06.549
But it is also repealing Section 311.

08:02:07.069 --> 08:02:13.431
Section 311 was a result of Proposition 227, which actually asked for a waiver.

08:02:13.691 --> 08:02:19.192
A parent needed to fill out a waiver for a child to be able to enter into a bilingual program.

08:02:20.012 --> 08:02:23.755
So that section of Ed Code, it was completely repealed.

08:02:24.315 --> 08:02:32.720
The initiative defines programs for English learners and embraces multilingualism for all students, not just English learners, for all students.

08:02:33.481 --> 08:02:45.789
It also repeals the requirement of the alternative waiver, but it does keep the requirement to know who would like to have those programs because that needs to happen in order to implement them.

08:02:46.269 --> 08:02:59.761
The California Edge Initiative specifies that parents of English learners may choose a program that best suits the needs of their child, and the local education agency must provide a structured English immersion as the one program choice.

08:03:01.863 --> 08:03:10.746
The proposed regulations aim to clarify the statute by providing definitions and clarification and processes to assist districts in complying with the statute.

08:03:11.146 --> 08:03:27.352
So as a minimum, when districts offer language acquisition programs, they are to offer structured English immersion, but they are also to offer other types of programs, dual language immersion, transitional programs, developmental programs.

08:03:29.193 --> 08:03:44.440
And there's also a provision for language programs, which are for English only students or students that would like to learn another language on top of their English with the goal of developing proficiency in both languages.

08:03:44.980 --> 08:03:53.764
The California Edge Initiative provides for the inclusion of parent and community member input as part of the process required to develop a local control and accountability plan.

08:03:54.787 --> 08:04:01.609
the LCAP while considering the establishment of language acquisition programs and language programs at the local education agency.

08:04:02.009 --> 08:04:05.210
That's one of the key areas the regulations attempts to clarify.

08:04:05.730 --> 08:04:08.831
As you know, regulations only clarify the law, they don't create new law.

08:04:09.511 --> 08:04:16.813
So, the regulations attempt to clarify what's required of the local education agencies

08:04:17.693 --> 08:04:24.896
in terms of providing notice annually on the types of language programs in accordance to Education Code Section 48980.

08:04:25.416 --> 08:04:30.158
And this information assists parents in choosing a program that best suits the needs of their children.

08:04:30.678 --> 08:04:40.502
The initiative specifies that parents may choose a language acquisition program at their school and the school provides that program when the threshold in law is met to the extent possible.

08:04:41.082 --> 08:04:46.364
So the threshold in the law is 30 in a school and 20 in a grade level that request those programs.

08:04:46.864 --> 08:04:56.008
So the proposed regulations are intended to provide clarity and direction to local education agencies for the purpose of complying with the provisions of the California initiative.

08:04:56.468 --> 08:05:06.633
The regulations are designed to guide local education agencies and school sites towards a process that incorporates parents and stakeholders into the process of establishing language acquisition programs.

08:05:07.273 --> 08:05:17.540
We are asking that the State Board of Education take the following action to open the rulemaking process for public comment period so members of the public may provide comment.

08:05:18.718 --> 08:05:27.204
And the slide would have provided you with the fact that there's a 45 comment public period that would begin July 29 of 2017.

08:05:27.284 --> 08:05:35.410
There would be a public hearing to be held September 11 of 2017, and that would be held here at the California Department of Education.

08:05:35.670 --> 08:05:42.395
We also have an email address where people can email comments, regcomments at cde.ca.gov.

08:05:43.175 --> 08:05:50.160
And all comments will be reviewed and taken into consideration during the revision of the proposed regulations.

08:05:50.200 --> 08:05:57.045
This is a common process that we take once an initiative of a law is passed and regulations are undertaken.

08:05:57.645 --> 08:06:07.792
So if substantive amendments are made to the proposed regulations at the end of the 45-day public comment period, an additional 15-day comment period may be required for consideration.

08:06:08.053 --> 08:06:08.673
Hopefully not.

08:06:08.873 --> 08:06:11.775
Hopefully we can pass it after the 45-day.

08:06:13.056 --> 08:06:19.459
And once revisions to the proposed regulations are complete, the State Board of Education considers revised regulations for adoption.

08:06:19.780 --> 08:06:22.961
You have the proposed regulations in your item as an attachment.

08:06:24.082 --> 08:06:29.825
Upon adoption, the regulations are submitted to the Office of Administrative Law for final review and approval.

08:06:30.425 --> 08:06:41.070
And additional information on the California EDGE initiative is available in the California Department of Education, California EDGE webpage that we have created.

08:06:42.991 --> 08:06:51.259
And the link is also included in that PowerPoint that didn't show, but it is in the link on our website right now.

08:06:51.279 --> 08:06:52.380
Thank you.

08:06:53.081 --> 08:06:54.382
Okay.

08:06:54.462 --> 08:06:56.624
I think we're ready then for board discussion.

08:06:58.986 --> 08:06:59.727
Board member Rucker.

08:07:01.383 --> 08:07:12.408
Okay, so I was still a teacher in California, just beginning my career in a different venue when the UNS initiative was passed.

08:07:12.928 --> 08:07:18.050
And I was, if somebody had told me that that was going to happen, I would have been surprised.

08:07:18.510 --> 08:07:26.733
And what has gotten me through all of this time was a quote from Maya Angelou, when people show you who they are, believe them.

08:07:27.274 --> 08:07:27.574
And so,

08:07:29.204 --> 08:07:34.245
today, people can believe us on this with the action we're going to take.

08:07:34.665 --> 08:07:41.387
But how well I remember what the impact of that simple initiative was.

08:07:41.947 --> 08:07:45.508
This board was defunded by the legislature.

08:07:45.768 --> 08:07:49.089
We did not adopt an English Language Arts curriculum.

08:07:49.109 --> 08:07:53.070
We had arguments about the content of the English Language Arts

08:07:53.550 --> 08:07:54.171
framework.

08:07:54.251 --> 08:08:03.179
There were people who were appointed to this board whose appointment was not reaffirmed by the legislature because of arguments over these issues.

08:08:03.920 --> 08:08:08.964
I met a young man named Tom Adams in a legislative meeting.

08:08:09.885 --> 08:08:22.093
So we have come a long way, but the fact of the matter is within this community, we have also changed the way that we have this conversation.

08:08:22.474 --> 08:08:31.179
That through all of that bitterness and all of those conflicts, we've gotten to this point and we took action on that previous item.

08:08:31.219 --> 08:08:37.243
So to be able today to follow up that action with this step is quite significant.

08:08:37.263 --> 08:08:39.185
So I'm going to quote Maya Angelou again.

08:08:39.726 --> 08:08:44.320
When people show you who they are, as we're about to do today, you need to believe them.

08:08:50.472 --> 08:08:52.492
Okay, any further board comment on this?

08:08:52.532 --> 08:08:53.393
State Superintendent?

08:08:53.693 --> 08:09:08.215
I'll just be very brief and mention one slight amendment to Veronica's great presentation and Patricia were with you in the same feelings and all the board, but 73% passed.

08:09:08.275 --> 08:09:14.196
I mean, when do you get three out of four people agreeing on anything, especially something that was so controversial, so divisive?

08:09:14.556 --> 08:09:17.157
So it's been an enormous mindset shift.

08:09:17.877 --> 08:09:19.177
and understanding shift.

08:09:19.197 --> 08:09:24.299
And we know language is a way to understand other peoples and their culture and their aspirations and values.

08:09:24.359 --> 08:09:27.359
And so, yay, this is a great step forward.

08:09:28.040 --> 08:09:31.380
Yeah, and the proposition passed in every California county.

08:09:31.440 --> 08:09:34.861
That was even more astounding to me, you know.

08:09:35.241 --> 08:09:40.203
So, we'll... Okay, no further comment.

08:09:40.243 --> 08:09:41.783
Is there any public comment on this side?

08:09:42.577 --> 08:09:44.619
Yes, would the following people please line up?

08:09:44.739 --> 08:09:52.969
Cheryl Ortega, Peter Shilla, Carla Herrera, Lori Olson, Vicki Ramos-Harris, and Martha Alvarez.

08:10:12.844 --> 08:10:14.045
Good night, I mean good evening.

08:10:20.047 --> 08:10:29.691
I'm Cheryl Ortega and I'm the director of bilingual education for United Teachers Los Angeles, a bilingual educator for 47 years and a Prop 227 warrior as well.

08:10:32.577 --> 08:10:32.898
Can't do it.

08:10:34.179 --> 08:10:44.153
On the day after the election, the multilingual department of LAUSD was ready to act, and we applaud their outstanding proactive efforts to support language learning.

08:10:44.994 --> 08:10:49.080
The executive director gathered her team and began planning how to implement language learning.

08:10:49.900 --> 08:10:55.483
From the start, it was determined that broad collaboration with learning partners was the way to ensure success.

08:10:56.323 --> 08:11:02.966
So in January, the Prop 58 transition team was born, meeting biweekly throughout the entire semester.

08:11:03.486 --> 08:11:10.730
The goals collaborate with various departments, including administrators, teachers, parents, labor partners, and external experts.

08:11:11.710 --> 08:11:20.258
Consult CDE regulations to align to district policy and develop policies and communication plan to implement the Multilingual Education Act.

08:11:21.179 --> 08:11:24.022
Also partnering with higher education institutions.

08:11:24.562 --> 08:11:34.712
We're asking you, the transition team is asking you for guidance through the state regulations and we hope that this model of collaboration will be implemented statewide because it's a really, really good way to get things done.

08:11:35.573 --> 08:11:35.833
Thank you.

08:11:41.354 --> 08:11:42.115
Good evening.

08:11:42.255 --> 08:11:44.997
I'm Peter Schilla with Californians Together.

08:11:45.778 --> 08:11:51.142
We strongly support the department's recommendation for your action today.

08:11:51.162 --> 08:12:01.912
And I have to say my first reading of these regulations is at least a thousand percent better than the ones they're supposed to be improving on.

08:12:03.251 --> 08:12:09.113
I'd also like to say that I think the field needs the guidance of these regulations.

08:12:09.773 --> 08:12:14.174
And we appreciate that you're going to move forward and put them out for public comment.

08:12:14.654 --> 08:12:19.916
And we enthusiastically will be consulting with the field and providing our input.

08:12:20.336 --> 08:12:21.776
Thank you very much.

08:12:26.058 --> 08:12:27.118
I just want to say thank you.

08:12:28.732 --> 08:12:29.232
Hello again.

08:12:29.352 --> 08:12:32.754
I'm Carta Herrera, a retired educator, bilingual educator.

08:12:33.195 --> 08:12:51.185
In 1974, when the Laud decision passed, I was doing my student teaching, and I went from an idealistic, bilingual, passionate educator during the case studies with Veronica's predecessor's department to being mid-career, just so demoralized when Prop 227 passed.

08:12:52.806 --> 08:12:54.487
with many people in this room.

08:12:54.547 --> 08:13:04.029
So I just want to say thank you and that we look forward to providing input on the regulations for implementing Proposition 58 during the comment period.

08:13:04.429 --> 08:13:19.774
We believe that regulations will provide the critical guidance needed to the many schools and districts that are interested in initiating and expanding their current bilingual programs to support the opportunity for all students to develop proficiency in English and another language.

08:13:20.854 --> 08:13:37.730
Supporting schools and districts wanting to develop multilingual programs is consistent with the results of the recently released study by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine with states promising results for English learners and dual language learners.

08:13:37.791 --> 08:13:38.131
Thank you.

08:13:42.608 --> 08:13:43.088
Good evening.

08:13:43.168 --> 08:13:43.749
Hello again.

08:13:45.409 --> 08:13:48.091
My name is Vicky Ramos-Harris from Advancement Project, as you know.

08:13:49.591 --> 08:13:56.235
We want to say thank you and also we look forward to offering input with the regulations for implementation of Proposition 58.

08:13:57.956 --> 08:14:01.257
As others have said, this is going to be critical, important guidance.

08:14:02.638 --> 08:14:10.522
Also, given what you've heard me say before, given what the research shows on early childhood education, there's a critical window for language development in the earliest years.

08:14:11.542 --> 08:14:17.425
And we've seen this in the research with the National Academies and much progress over the last decade.

08:14:18.246 --> 08:14:27.011
So we want to make sure that the guidance also includes support and guidance for including early childhood in the implementation of Proposition 58.

08:14:27.731 --> 08:14:35.375
We've seen what this looks like at LA Unified who just passed up a dual language learner early childhood pilot that's being implemented.

08:14:35.575 --> 08:14:37.036
implemented this upcoming year.

08:14:37.396 --> 08:14:39.158
Long Beach Unified is also implementing.

08:14:39.298 --> 08:14:43.761
So there's some examples of early childhood dual immersion programs.

08:14:43.821 --> 08:14:47.244
We need to see a lot more and the guidance from the state is needed.

08:14:47.384 --> 08:14:47.724
Thank you.

08:14:47.744 --> 08:14:52.247
Okay, that's the end of the public comment.

08:14:52.327 --> 08:14:53.748
No further board comment.

08:14:54.529 --> 08:14:55.810
All those in favor of the motion.

08:14:57.471 --> 08:14:58.512
Oh, we have to have a motion.

08:15:01.074 --> 08:15:01.494
Sorry.

08:15:03.215 --> 08:15:03.516
Thank you.

08:15:04.720 --> 08:15:11.165
I motion to move the department's recommendation to begin public comment and everything else.

08:15:11.305 --> 08:15:14.248
So I'll just motion to move the department's recommendation.

08:15:17.450 --> 08:15:18.111
Who was second?

08:15:19.632 --> 08:15:20.072
Thank you.

08:15:20.252 --> 08:15:21.033
Okay.

08:15:21.433 --> 08:15:23.535
Now there's no further comment and we're ready to vote.

08:15:23.995 --> 08:15:24.676
Raise your hands.

08:15:24.716 --> 08:15:26.578
That passes unanimously.

08:15:27.158 --> 08:15:27.578
Thank you.

08:15:28.079 --> 08:15:28.499
Thank you.

08:15:29.460 --> 08:15:29.940
Now we're...

08:15:35.660 --> 08:15:41.384
We're on to the waiver process, and I think all waivers are on consent.

08:15:42.425 --> 08:15:43.505
So I'm going to move.

08:15:43.525 --> 08:15:46.227
Yeah, I know some have to recuse.

08:15:46.808 --> 08:15:47.048
Yes.

08:15:47.608 --> 08:15:54.032
So waivers, we're going to do waiver consent votes on W1, 2, and 4.

08:15:56.829 --> 08:15:57.129
through 19.

08:15:58.510 --> 08:16:05.272
So we're going to have a consent vote here on every waiver except waiver three.

08:16:06.292 --> 08:16:13.754
And board members Ortiz-Lacon and Ting have recused themselves.

08:16:14.595 --> 08:16:15.415
I move the consent.

08:16:16.215 --> 08:16:17.095
Their public comment.

08:16:17.675 --> 08:16:18.036
Okay.

08:16:18.156 --> 08:16:18.356
Yeah.

08:16:18.436 --> 08:16:19.176
Is there a second?

08:16:19.376 --> 08:16:19.936
He's moved.

08:16:20.916 --> 08:16:21.677
Second Rucker.

08:16:21.797 --> 08:16:22.477
Public comment.

08:16:25.613 --> 08:16:35.512
Shalon Shalon and Cruz Gonzalez Colleen Pachter and Angela de Ramos Come forward, please

08:16:36.670 --> 08:16:38.391
I did not expect to speak on this item.

08:16:38.592 --> 08:16:51.802
So I actually came up here to speak on the previous items, but I was really surprised to see an item here contemplating a waiver to San Gabriel Unified on an option for youth charter school that operates within our boundaries of Azusa Unified School District.

08:16:52.583 --> 08:16:54.544
I'm just here to express our opposition to this waiver.

08:16:54.865 --> 08:16:58.608
We have never been formally informed of the fact that they're operating within our district.

08:16:58.908 --> 08:17:01.170
They have never reached out to discuss anything with us.

08:17:01.890 --> 08:17:04.792
And we were not even aware that this was going to be on this agenda item today.

08:17:05.172 --> 08:17:10.815
So I wanted to express our concern about that whole process and the transparency of this.

08:17:10.995 --> 08:17:13.616
And again, express our opposition to this waiver.

08:17:13.816 --> 08:17:14.156
Thank you.

08:17:14.176 --> 08:17:15.177
Okay.

08:17:16.438 --> 08:17:17.238
Come forward, please.

08:17:21.363 --> 08:17:24.486
Hi, Colleen Pachter on behalf of Los Angeles Unified School District.

08:17:25.607 --> 08:17:39.799
We respectfully ask the State Board of Education to deny the request submitted by San Gabriel Unified School District, William S. Hart Union High School District, and Acton-Agua Dulce Unified School District on behalf of their respective non-classroom based independent charter schools.

08:17:40.660 --> 08:17:52.795
Each of these three schools seeks a waiver of the geographical and site limitations set forth in the Charter Schools Act in order to continue operating one or more resource centers locating within LAUSD's boundaries for one more year.

08:17:54.252 --> 08:18:16.968
In addition to the objections presented in the letter and attached materials submitted by LAUSD, we wish to highlight our continuing concern that approval of these waiver requests would compromise local control and marginalize the central role of LAUSD's democratically elected board, ensuring that students living and attending public school within the district's jurisdiction have an equitable opportunity to receive a high quality education.

08:18:17.308 --> 08:18:21.151
We therefore urge this board to deny these charter school location waiver requests.

08:18:22.892 --> 08:18:24.673
Okay, that ends the public comment.

08:18:24.794 --> 08:18:26.135
Any further board discussion?

08:18:27.316 --> 08:18:28.316
I'm ready for a motion.

08:18:30.518 --> 08:18:31.699
You have one, okay.

08:18:32.079 --> 08:18:33.621
All those in favor of the motion?

08:18:34.341 --> 08:18:34.701
Thank you.

08:18:36.022 --> 08:18:40.466
Okay, now we have waiver consent vote three, Rucker recusal.

08:19:00.430 --> 08:19:00.850
Okay.

08:19:01.070 --> 08:19:02.371
I move staff recommendation.

08:19:04.631 --> 08:19:08.372
Any public comment on these, on this motion, on this W-3?

08:19:09.193 --> 08:19:12.294
No, no public comment on W-3.

08:19:13.194 --> 08:19:15.554
Okay, we're all ready for the vote.

08:19:16.675 --> 08:19:17.535
Those are your hands.

08:19:18.115 --> 08:19:20.016
Yeah, okay, that W-3 carries.

08:19:21.235 --> 08:19:24.596
Okay, now we're ready for proposed consent.

08:19:24.676 --> 08:19:29.777
These are our consent items, and they are items 7 through 17.

08:19:31.578 --> 08:19:31.838
So.

08:19:32.038 --> 08:19:33.158
I move the consent items.

08:19:33.218 --> 08:19:37.639
Okay, there's a second by Sandoval.

08:19:38.299 --> 08:19:39.880
Is there any public comment on these?

08:19:40.560 --> 08:19:41.700
Yes, Eduardo Aguilar.

08:19:49.096 --> 08:19:50.076
Don't forget her, yeah.

08:19:50.577 --> 08:19:53.358
Okay, it doesn't appear this person's here?

08:19:58.299 --> 08:20:01.520
Sure, the person signed up is Eduardo Aguilar.

08:20:01.540 --> 08:20:06.342
Okay, no public comment.

08:20:06.802 --> 08:20:07.563
We have a motion.

08:20:07.843 --> 08:20:09.283
All those in favor, raise your hand.

08:20:10.964 --> 08:20:16.926
Okay, then we have one person who wants to do a public comment for one minute who can't come tomorrow.

08:20:25.693 --> 08:20:26.907
a general public comment.

08:20:28.666 --> 08:20:32.889
Thank you for the courtesy of letting me make this comment today.

08:20:32.909 --> 08:20:36.451
I am Doug McRae, a retired testing specialist from Monterey.

08:20:37.252 --> 08:20:40.754
Two quick comments on June information memos that were not on the agenda.

08:20:41.274 --> 08:20:49.420
First, one of the memos for LPAC revealed a change in how to establish cut scores, namely to use LPAC field test data for this aspect of test development.

08:20:49.460 --> 08:20:55.844
It's very poor educational measurement practice since field tests are not designed to produce data for valid standard setting.

08:20:56.605 --> 08:20:58.166
More on this in your electronic folder.

08:20:58.906 --> 08:21:08.836
Second, the CASP memo included a number of points that need your attention, including unwarranted delay for release of statewide test results from mid-August until September.

08:21:09.577 --> 08:21:13.340
And second, still no information on the adequacy of Smarter Balanced item banks.

08:21:14.001 --> 08:21:18.425
This item, this information is needed to determine if the computer adaptive future feature

08:21:19.606 --> 08:21:26.152
is capable of measuring the low spectrum of achievement and hence supplying accurate achievement gap data.

08:21:26.773 --> 08:21:34.879
It's also needed for evaluation of the quality of the interim tests, which is being challenged by AB 1035, now making its way through the legislature.

08:21:35.620 --> 08:21:37.422
Again, thank you for hearing my comment.

08:21:38.583 --> 08:21:40.324
Okay, the board is adjourned for the day.
